Apple and Microsoft defined the PC market; Microsoft and Intel won it. Google and Meta dominate digital advertising; Apple and Google won mobile. That, however, is not the defining pair of the smartphone era, which ran from the introduction of the iPhone in 2007 to the launch of ChatGPT in 2022; rather, the two most important companies of the last two decades of tech were Apple and Amazon, specifically AWS. The Apple part is easy: the iPhone market created the smartphone paradigm, from its user interface (touch) to its distribution channel (the App Store), and was richly rewarded with a bit under half of the unit marketshare and a bit under all of the total profits. Google did well to control the rest in terms of the Android operating system, and profit from it all thanks to Google Search, but it was Search that remained their north star; the company’s primary error in the era was the few years they let the tail (Android) wave the dog (Google). The AWS part is maybe less obvious, but no less critical — and the timing is notable. Amazon created AWS in 2006, just 10 months before the iPhone unveiling, and the paradigm they created was equally critical to the smartphone era. I explained the link in 2020’s The End of the Beginning: This last point gets at why the cloud and mobile, which are often thought of as two distinct paradigm shifts, are very much connected: the cloud meant applications and data could be accessed from anywhere; mobile made the I/O layer available everywhere. The combination of the two make computing continuous. What is notable is that the current environment appears to be the logical endpoint of all of these changes: from batch-processing to continuous computing, from a terminal in a different room to a phone in your pocket, from a tape drive to data centers all over the globe. In this view the personal computer/on-premises server era was simply a stepping stone between two ends of a clearly defined range. AWS was not the only public cloud provider, of course — Azure and Google Cloud Platform were both launched in 2008 — but by virtue of being first they both defined the paradigm and also were the the first choice of the universe of applications that ran on smartphones or, more accurately, ran everywhere. If Apple and AWS were the definers — and thus winners — of the smartphone era, then it was Microsoft and Nokia that were the losers. The reasons for their failure were myriad, but there was one common thread: neither could shake off the overhang of having won their previous paradigm; indeed, both failed in part because they deluded themselves into thinking that their previous domination was an advantage. For Microsoft that previous paradigm was the PC and the Windows platform, which the company thought they could extend to mobile; from 2014’s Microsoft’s Mobile Muddle: Saying “Microsoft missed mobile” is a bit unfair; Windows Mobile came out way back in 2000, and the whole reason Google bought Android was the fear that Microsoft would dominate mobile the way they dominated the PC era. It turned out, though, that mobile devices, with their focus on touch, simplified interfaces, and ARM foundation, were nothing like PCs. Everyone had to start from scratch, and if starting from scratch, by definition Microsoft didn’t have any sort of built-in advantage. They were simply out-executed. It took Microsoft years — and a new CEO — to realize their mistake, up and to the point where they put their enterprise productivity dominance at risk; from 2015’s Redmond and Reality: There’s reality, and there’s Redmond, and if one thing marked the last few years of Steve Ballmer’s tenure as the CEO of Microsoft, it was the sense that those were two distinct locales. In reality, Android (plus AOSP in China) and iOS were carving up the world phone market; in Redmond Ballmer doubled-down on the losing Window Phone bet by buying Nokia. In reality Office was losing relevance because of its absence on the mobile platforms that mattered; in Redmond Ballmer personally delayed Office on iOS until the Windows Modern née Metro version was finished. And in reality, all kinds of startups were taking aim at the Microsoft enterprise stack; in Redmond, Microsoft was determined to own it all, just as they had in the PC era. It’s fitting that Microsoft and Nokia ended up together; perhaps they were able to jointly go to therapy for success-induced obliviousness of market realities. Nokia dominated the phone market for the decade prior to the iPhone, and even once the iPhone was announced, blithely assumed that they could simply lean on their existing advantages to fend off the Silicon Valley usurper. From 2013’s Blackberry — and Nokia’s — Fundamental Failing: Nokia dominated all the parts of this stack you don’t see: they had, and in some respects, still have, the best supply chain and distribution network. In addition, they had high quality hardware that served every segment imaginable. Notably absent in these strengths is the OS and Apps. By 2009, BlackBerry OS and Symbian were clearly obsolete, and their app ecosystems, such as they were, were eclipsed by iOS and then Android. The problem, as I alluded to above, is that while the OS was ultimately under the control of BlackBerry and Nokia, respectively, and thus could be fixed, the efficacy of their ecosystem wasn’t, and wouldn’t be… And so, by far the smartest strategic thing either could have done would have been to accept their weakness — they didn’t have an adequate OS or ecosystem — and focus on their strengths…Nokia should have adopted Android-stock, and used their unmatched supply chain and distribution to do to their competitors, well, exactly what Nokia had been doing to their competitors for the last decade (if you think Samsung is running roughshod over everyone today, in 2007 they could only manage 41 million phones compared to Nokia’s 110 million). Both BlackBerry and Nokia would have gotten a good OS and thriving ecosystem for free and been able to compete and differentiate themselves on the exact same vectors they had previously. To put it another way, RIM and Nokia had never been successful because of their OS or ecosystem, yet both decided their best response to iOS and Android was to build a new OS! In fact, the strategic superiority of the Android option for RIM and Nokia was even then so obvious that I suspect their core failing was not so much strategic as it was all-too-human: pride. Owning an ecosystem seems much more important than owning services or supply chains, even if building said ecosystem completely devalues what you’re actually good at. If the first commonality in Microsoft and Nokia’s failure is the assumption that dominance in one paradigm would seamlessly translate into dominance in the next, then the second was in not making the strategically obvious choice — embracing iOS and Android for Windows, and Android for Nokia — for fear of losing control and long-term relevance. What separates the two companies is that Microsoft, under CEO Satya Nadella, rectified their mistake, while Nokia doubled-down with Windows Phone; that is why Microsoft still matters today — more than ever, in fact — while Nokia phones no longer exist. The two companies that stood in constrast to Microsoft and Nokia were Google and Samsung; while their dominance of the non-iPhone market seems obvious in retrospect, it wasn’t at all pre-ordained. What is impressive about both companies is that they had the opposite of pride: both were quite shameless, in fact. From 2013’s Shameless Samsung: Every pre-iPhone phone maker is irrelevant, if they even exist, except for Samsung, who is thriving. Samsung the copycat was smart enough to realize they needed to change, and quickly, and so they did. Or maybe it wasn’t being smart. Maybe it was simply not caring what anyone else thought about them, their strategy, or their inspiration. Most successful companies, including Apple, including Google, seem remarkably capable of ignoring the naysayers and simply doing what is right for their company. In the case of smartphones, why wouldn’t you copy the iPhone? Nokia refused and look where that got them! We, especially in the West, have a powerful sense of justice and fairness when it comes to product features and being first. Business, though, is not fair, even if it is more just than we care to admit. Just as Samsung blatantly copied Apple hardware, Android blatantly copied the iOS interface: Plenty of people mocked Google for this shift, but not me: Apple figured out what worked; it would have been foolish to not copy them. Foolish like Microsoft and Nokia. There were striking resemblances in last week’s earnings calls from Apple and Amazon, not just to each other, but to this early smartphone era that I have just recounted. Both companies are facing questions about their AI strategies — Apple for its failure to invest in a large language model of its own, or deeply partner with a model builder, and Amazon for prioritizing its own custom architectures and under-deploying leading edge Nvidia solutions — and both had similar responses: It’s Early Tim Cook (from a post-earnings all-hands meeting): Cook struck an optimistic tone, noting that Apple is typically late to promising new technologies. “We’ve rarely been first,” the executive told staffers. “There was a PC before the Mac; there was a smartphone before the iPhone; there were many tablets before the iPad; there was an MP3 player before iPod.” But Apple invented the “modern” versions of those product categories, he said. “This is how I feel about AI.” Andy Jassy: The first thing I would say is that I think it is so early right now in AI. If you look at what’s really happening in the space, it’s very top heavy. So you have a small number of very large frontier models that are being trained that spend a lot on computing, a couple of which are being trained on top of AWS and others are being trained elsewhere. And then you also have, I would say, a relatively small number of very large-scale generative AI applications. We Will Serve Actual Use Cases Tim Cook: We see AI as one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime. We are embedding it across our devices and platforms and across the company. We are also significantly growing our investments. Apple has always been about taking the most advanced technologies and making them easy to use and accessible for everyone, and that’s at the heart of our AI strategy. With Apple Intelligence, we’re integrating AI features across our platforms in a way that is deeply personal, private, and seamless, right where users need them. Andy Jassy: We have a very significant number of enterprises and startups who are running applications on top of AWS’ AI services and but, like the amount of usage and the expansiveness of the use cases and how much people are putting them into production and the number of agents that are going to exist, it’s still just earlier stage than it’s going to be, and so then when you think about what’s going to matter in AI, what are customers going to care about when they’re thinking about what infrastructure use, I think you kind of have to look at the different layers of the stack. And I think…if you look at where the real costs are, they’re going to ultimately be an inference today, so much of the cost in training because customers are really training their models and trying to figure out to get the applications into production. Our Chips Are Best Tim Cook: Apple Silicon is at the heart of all of these experiences, enabling powerful Apple Intelligence features to run directly on device. For more advanced tasks, our servers, also powered by Apple Silicon, deliver even greater capabilities while preserving user privacy through our Private Cloud Compute architecture. We believe our platforms offer the best way for users to experience the full potential of generative AI. Thanks to the exceptional performance of our systems, our users are able to run generative AI models right on their Mac, iPad, and iPhone. We’re excited about the work we’re doing in this space, and it’s incredibly rewarding to see the strong momentum building. Andy Jassy: At scale, 80% to 90% of the cost will be an inference because you only train periodically, but you’re spinning out predictions and inferences all the time, and so what they’re going to care a lot about is they’re going to care about the compute and the hardware they’re using. We have a very deep partnership with Nvidia and will for as long as I can foresee, but we saw this movie in the CPU space with Intel, where customers are anchoring for better price performance. And so we built just like in the CPU space, where we built our own custom silicon and building Graviton which is about 40% more price performance than the other leading x86 processors, we’ve done the same thing on the custom silicon side in AI with Trainium and our second version of Trainium2…it’s about 30% and 40% better price performance than the other GPU providers out there right now, and we’re already working on our third version of Trainium as well. So I think a lot of the compute and the inference is going to ultimately be run on top of Trainium2. We Have the Data Tim Cook: We’re making good progress on a more personalized Siri, and we do expect to release the features next year, as we had said earlier. Our focus from an AI point of view is on putting AI features across the platform that are deeply personal, private, and seamlessly integrated, and, of course, we’ve done that with more than 20 Apple Intelligence features so far, from Visual Intelligence to Clean Up to Writing Tools and all the rest. Andy Jassy: People aren’t paying as close attention as they will and making sure that those generative AI applications are operating where the rest of their data and infrastructure. Remember, a lot of generative AI inference is just going to be another building block like compute, storage and database. And so people are going to actually want to run those applications close to where the other applications are running, where their data is. There’s just so many more applications and data running in AWS than anywhere else. Both Apple and Amazon’s arguments are very plausible! To summarize each: Apple: Large language models are useful, but will be a commodity, and easily accessible on your iPhone; what is the most useful to people, however, is AI that has your private data as context, and only we can provide that. We will provide AI with your data as context at scale and at low cost — both in terms of CapEx and OpEx — by primarily running inference on device. People are also concerned about sharing their personal data with AI companies, so when we need more capabilities we will use our own compute infrastructure, which will run on our own chips, not Nvidia chips. Amazon: Large language models are useful, but will be a commodity, and widely available on any cloud. What is the most useful to companies, however, is AI that has your enterprise data as context, and more enterprises are on AWS than anywhere else. We will provide AI with a company’s data as context at scale and at low cost — both in terms of CapEx and OpEx — by primarily running inference on our own AI chips, not Nvidia chips. What is notable about both arguments — and again, this doesn’t mean they are wrong! — is how conveniently they align with how the companies operated in the previous era. Apple powered apps with Apple Silicon on the edge with an emphasis on privacy, and Amazon powered apps in the cloud with its own custom architecture focused first and foremost on low costs. The risk both companies are taking is the implicit assumption that AI is not a paradigm shift like mobile was. In Apple’s case, they assume that users want an iPhone first, and will ultimately be satisfied with good-enough local AI; in AWS’s case, they assume that AI is just another primitive like compute or storage that enterprises will tack onto their AWS bill. I wrote after last fall’s re:Invent: The emphasis on “choice” in the presentation, first in terms of regular AWS, and then later in terms of AI, is another way to say that the options are, in the end, mere commodities. Sure, the cutting edge for both inference and especially training will be Nvidia, and AWS will offer Nvidia instances (to the extent they fit in AWS’ network), but AWS’s bet is that a necessary component of generative AI being productized is that models fade in importance. Note this bit from Garman leading up to his Bedrock discussion: We talked about wanting this set of building blocks that builders could use to invent anything that they could imagine. We also talked about how many of the cases we walked through today, that we’ve redefined how people thought about these as applications change. Now people’s expectations are actually changing for applications again with generative AI, and increasingly my view is generative AI inference is going to be a core building block for every single application. In fact, I think generative AI actually has the potential to transform every single industry, every single company out there, every single workflow out there, every single user experience out there… This expansive view of generative AI’s importance — notice how Garman put it on the same level as the compute, storage, and database primitives — emphasizes the importance of it becoming a commodity, with commodity-like concerns about price, performance, and flexibility. In other words, exactly what AWS excels at. To put it another way, AWS’s bet is that AI will be important enough that it won’t, in the end, be special at all, which is very much Amazon’s sweet spot. Go back to that illustration from The End of the Beginning: Apple and Amazon are betting that AI is just another primitive in continuous computing that happens everywhere. The most optimistic AI scenarios, however, point to something new: A better word for “Anywhere” is probably autonomous, but I wanted to stick with the “Where” theme; what I’m talking about, however, is agents: AI doing work without any human involvement at all. The potential productivity gains for companies are obvious: there is a massive price umbrella for inference costs if the end result is that you don’t need to employ a human to do the same work. In this world what matters most is performance, not cost, which means that Amazon’s obsession with costs is missing the point; it’s also a world where the company’s lack of a competitive leading edge model makes it harder for them to compete, particularly when there is another company in the ecosystem — Google — that not only has its own custom chip strategy (TPUs), but also is integrating those chips with its competitive leading edge large language model (Gemini). Tim Cook, meanwhile, has talked for years now about his excitement about AR glasses, which fit with the idea of augmentation; Mark Gurman reported in Bloomberg earlier this year: Still, all of this is a stepping stone toward Cook’s grand vision, which hasn’t changed in a decade. He wants true augmented reality glasses — lightweight spectacles that a customer could wear all day. The AR element will overlay data and images onto real-world views. Cook has made this idea a top priority for the company and is hell-bent on creating an industry-leading product before Meta can. “Tim cares about nothing else,” says someone with knowledge of the matter. “It’s the only thing he’s really spending his time on from a product development standpoint.” Still, it will take many years for true AR glasses to be ready. A variety of technologies need to be perfected, including extraordinarily high-resolution displays, a high-performance chip and a tiny battery that could offer hours of power each day. Apple also needs to figure out applications that make such a device as compelling as the iPhone. And all this has to be available in large quantities at a price that won’t turn off consumers. What seems likely to me is that for this product to succeed, Apple will need to figure out generative AI as well; I posited last year that generative AI will undergird future user interfaces in The Gen AI Bridge to the Future. From a section recounting my experience with Meta’s Orion AR glasses: This, I think, is the future: the exact UI you need — and nothing more — exactly when you need it, and at no time else. This specific example was, of course, programmed deterministically, but you can imagine a future where the glasses are smart enough to generate UI on the fly based on the context of not just your request, but also your broader surroundings and state. This is where you start to see the bridge: what I am describing is an application of generative AI, specifically to on-demand UI interfaces. It’s also an application that you can imagine being useful on devices that already exist. A watch application, for example, would be much more usable if, instead of trying to navigate by touch like a small iPhone, it could simply show you the exact choices you need to make at a specific moment in time. Again, we get hints of that today through deterministic programming, but the ultimate application will be on-demand via generative AI. This may sound fanciful, but then again, I wrote in early 2022 that generative AI would be the key to making the metaverse viable: In the very long run this points to a metaverse vision that is much less deterministic than your typical video game, yet much richer than what is generated on social media. Imagine environments that are not drawn by artists but rather created by AI: this not only increases the possibilities, but crucially, decreases the costs. That may have also sounded fanciful at the time, but it’s already reality: just yesterday Google DeepMind announced Genie 3; from their blog post: Today we are announcing Genie 3, a general purpose world model that can generate an unprecedented diversity of interactive environments. Given a text prompt, Genie 3 can generate dynamic worlds that you can navigate in real time at 24 frames per second, retaining consistency for a few minutes at a resolution of 720p. […] Achieving a high degree of controllability and real-time interactivity in Genie 3 required significant technical breakthroughs. During the auto-regressive generation of each frame, the model has to take into account the previously generated trajectory that grows with time. For example, if the user is revisiting a location after a minute, the model has to refer back to the relevant information from a minute ago. To achieve real-time interactivity, this computation must happen multiple times per second in response to new user inputs as they arrive… Genie 3’s consistency is an emergent capability. Other methods such as NeRFs and Gaussian Splatting also allow consistent navigable 3D environments, but depend on the provision of an explicit 3D representation. By contrast, worlds generated by Genie 3 are far more dynamic and rich because they’re created frame by frame based on the world description and actions by the user. We are still far from the metaverse, to be clear, or on-demand interfaces in general, but it’s stunning how much closer we are than a mere three years ago; to that end, betting on current paradigms may make logical sense — particularly if you dominate the current paradigm — but things really are changing with stunning speed. Apple and Amazon’s risk may be much larger than either appreciate. Genie 3 is, as I noted, from Google, and thinking about these paradigm shifts — first the shift to mobile, and now the ongoing one to AI — has made me much more appreciative and respectful of Google. I recounted above how the company did what was necessary — including overhauling Android to mimic iOS — to capture its share of the mobile paradigm; as we approach the three year anniversary of ChatGPT, it’s hard to not be impressed at how the company has gone all-in on relevancy with AI. This wasn’t a guarantee: two months after ChatGPT, in early 2023, I wrote AI and the Big Five, and expressed my concerns about the company’s potential disruption: That, though, ought only increase the concern for Google’s management that generative AI may, in the specific context of search, represent a disruptive innovation instead of a sustaining one. Disruptive innovation is, at least in the beginning, not as good as what already exists; that’s why it is easily dismissed by managers who can avoid thinking about the business model challenges by (correctly!) telling themselves that their current product is better. The problem, of course, is that the disruptive product gets better, even as the incumbent’s product becomes ever more bloated and hard to use — and that certainly sounds a lot like Google Search’s current trajectory. I’m not calling the top for Google; I did that previously and was hilariously wrong. Being wrong, though, is more often than not a matter of timing: yes, Google has its cloud and YouTube’s dominance only seems to be increasing, but the outline of Search’s peak seems clear even if it throws off cash and profits for years. Meanwhile, I wasn’t worried about Apple and Amazon at all: I saw AI as being a complement for Apple, and predicted that the company would invest heavily in local inference; when it came to Amazon I was concerned that they might suffer from not have an integrated approach a la Google, but predicted that AI would slot in cleanly to their existing cloud business. In other words, exactly what Apple and Amazon’s executives are banking on. I wonder, however, if there is a version of this analysis that, were it written in 2007, might have looked like this: Nokia will be fine; once they make a modern OS, their existing manufacturing and distribution advantages will carry the day. Microsoft, meanwhile, will mimic the iPhone UI just like they once did the Mac, and then leverage their app advantage to dominate the lower end of the market. It’s Google, which depends on people clicking on links on a big desktop screen, that is in danger. I don’t, with the benefit of having actually known myself in 2007, think that would have been my take (and, of course, much of the early years of Stratechery were spent arguing with those who held exactly those types of views). I was, however, a Google skeptic, and I’m humble about that. And, meanwhile, I have that 2023 Article, where, in retrospect, I was quite rooted in the existing paradigm — which favors Apple and Amazon — and skeptical of Google’s ability and willingness to adapt. Today I feel differently. To go back to the smartphone paradigm, the best way to have analyzed what would happen to the market would have been to assume that the winners of the previous paradigm would be fundamentally handicapped in the new one, not despite their previous success, but because of it. Nokia and Microsoft pursued the wrong strategies because they thought they had advantages that ultimately didn’t matter in the face of a new paradigm. If I take that same analytical approach to AI, and assume that the winners of the previous paradigm will be fundamentally handicapped in the new one, not despite their previous success, but because of it, then I ought to have been alarmed about Apple and Amazon’s prospects from the get-go. I’m not, for the record, ready to declare either of them doomed; I am, however, much more alert to the prospect of them making wrong choices for years, the consequences of which won’t be clear until it’s too late. And, by the same token, I’m much more appreciative of Google’s amorphous nature and seeming lack of strategy. That makes them hard to analyze — again, I’ve been honest for years about the challenges I find in understanding Mountain View — but the company successfully navigated one paradigm shift, and is doing much better than I originally expected with this one. Larry Page and Sergey Brin famously weren’t particularly interested in business or in running a company; they just wanted to do cool things with computers in a college-like environment like they had at Stanford. That the company, nearly thirty years later, is still doing cool things with computers in a college-like environment may be maddening to analysts like me who want clarity and efficiency; it also may be the key to not just surviving but winning across multiple paradigms.

$68.5 million: MNTN’s total revenue for the second quarter, up 25% year-over-year. Nearly 4,000: The number of advertisers currently using MNTN’s technology, according to CEO Mark Douglas. “That rate is increasing at over 1,000 a quarter,” he added. 97%: The percentage of MNTN’s new (as of 2025) customers that had never advertised on TV before using the platform. $69.5-70.5 million: How much the company expects to make in the third quarter. 77%: MNTN’s gross margin, up from 70% in Q2 of 2024. That represents a 700 basis point improvement, the company said, largely due to MNTN’s decision to spin off Ryan Reynolds’ creative agency, Maximum Effort. Ahead of its first earnings call, MNTN saw a spike in stock price that took it to almost double the $16-per-share value it debuted at on May 21, dropping only slightly after yesterday’s earnings call. While Douglas didn’t offer an explanation for the dip, he pointed to the overall positive trend of the company’s stock prices as evidence of investors’ confidence in MNTN’s proposition: to give small- and midsized businesses access to performance-based CTV advertising. Douglas also claimed that the growth MNTN saw this quarter—85% uptick in active performance TV customers—is sustainable for the foreseeable future. “There are just a significant number of small- [and] midsized businesses,” he told ADWEEK. “We’re bringing them into the TV realm, and the rate at which are doing that is accelerating—we think it’s actually sustainable for quite a while.” He pointed to Meta, which made $46.6 billion in ad revenue in Q2 from millions of advertisers. The company is also piloting generative AI tools that help advertisers create TV ads, Douglas said. “We’re already generating thousands of AI-generated ads—over 1,000 customer-facing and 18,000 test ads,” he said. MNTN plans to officially launch the product later this year, which Douglas expects will make it easier for smaller advertisers to create 30-second TV spots at a significantly cheaper rate. MNTN expects to be able to continue to increase its gross margin following a significant jump in the past year, targeting growth between 75-80% in future quarters. “We’re sitting at 77% for the quarter, and that’s a quarter in which we didn’t have [Maximum Effort] and the creative costs, so that that’s a significant reduction,” Patrick Pohlen, MNTN’s chief financial officer, told investors during the call. By cutting hosting and media costs over the next few quarters, Pohlen expects MNTN will continue to improve on gross margin, he said. Kathryn Lundstrom is Adweek's sustainability editor.

Title: These are the top takeaways for investors from the latest high-profile earnings reports
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-earnings-q2-amd-scmi-palantir-ai-tech-stocks-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-06T15:02:23Z

Companies have reported mostly strong second-quarter earnings so far, but there are some specific takeaways investors should be aware of. So far, 82% of companies that have reported results have beaten estimated. According to FactSet, if that percentage holds, it will represent the highest percentage of quarterly earnings beats since the third quarter of 20221. Earnings will continue rolling in over the coming weeks, with tech titan Nvidia set to report at the end of August. Until then, here are some key insights from the last results: What happened: Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer both reported earnings for the second quarter on Tuesday, with mixed results. AMD beat on revenue, but missed earnings estimates slightly. The chipmaker posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.48, a hair below the expected $0.49 a share. Lisa Su, AMD's CEO, said the firm's AI revenue declined on a year-over-year basis largely due to US export restrictions, which have prevented AMD from selling its MI308 AI chip to China. Shares were down as much as 8% on Wednesday. Super Micro, meanwhile, missed slightly on both earnings and revenue. The chipmaker said revenue came in at $5.76 billion, below the expected $5.89 billion, and earnings per share came in at $0.41, below the $0.44 Wall Street expected. The miss was partly fueled by the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs, Charles Liang, the CEO, said on a call with analysts on Tuesday. Shares of the chipmaker were down 17% after the results. What it means: AI chip manufacturers are caught in the crossfire of the trade war. That's expected to remain a key concern as the US irons out the details of its trade relationship with China. The US and China have until August 12 to strike a trade deal before higher tariffs kick in, another headwind that could rattle the market and semiconductor stocks in particular. "Industry-wide tariff impact is only now being felt and could result in headwinds for the entire semiconductor industry," Gadjo Sevilla, a senior analyst at EMARKETER, wrote in a note. What happened: McDonald's beat on earnings and revenue expectations for the quarter, but voiced concerns about the health of lower-income consumers and the ability of Americans to keep spending. The fast food franchise said revenue came in at $6.84 billion for the quarter, above the $6.7 billion analysts expected. Earnings per share came in at an adjusted $3.19, above estimates of $3.15. "Re-engaging the low-income consumer is critical," Chris Kempczinski, the CEO, said on the company's earnings call, adding that low-income Americans were more likely to visit the chain than other income groups. "This bifurcated consumer base is why we remain cautious about the overall near-term health of the US consumer." What it means: Consumer spending is in focus for retail giants and for Wall Street, given the cumulative effects of inflation in recent years and Trump's tariffs. Economists say tariffs could stoke inflation, as companies can pass along the cost of import duties to consumers. For now, though spending remains fairly strong, even as concerns have risen recently around a pullback among both high and low-income households. What happened: Palantir blew past estimates for second quarter earnings. The data software firm revealed that its revenue surpassed $1 billion for the first time, reflecting a 55% year-over-year increase. Shares popped as much as 10% after its results, bringing the stock up 130% year-to-date. What it means: The AI trade is alive and well, with firms still benefitting from the hype for artificial intelligence. Wedbush Securities called Palantir the "Messi of AI" in a note to clients shortly after the firm reported earnings. In a separate note, analysts lifted their price target for the stock to $200 a share, implying 15% upside from current levels. "Palantir remains one of our top tech names to own in 2025 and this deal represents another opportunity for PLTR to capitalize on while continuing to generate unprecedented traction for its entire portfolio across the federal and commercial landscapes," analysts said. What happened: Microsoft and Meta both beat on earnings last week. Microsoft took in $76.4 billion in revenue and $3.65 in earnings per share, above estimates of $73.8 billion and $3.37 a share. The company also joined the $4 trillion club for the first time as its stock surged following its earnings report, with shares up 26% year-to-date. Meta, meanwhile, took in $47.5 billion in revenue and $7.14 in earnings per share, above estimates of $44.83 billion and $5.89 a share. The stock is up 27% year-to-date. What it means: Mega-cap tech is still dominating the market. Tech was best-performing area of the S&P 500 in July, with the sector up 5% in the month. The Nasdaq hit 14 record highs in July, causing Deutsche Bank to declare that "tech-ceptionalism" has resumed for the market. The strong outperformance of large-cap stocks accelerated, further widening the gap between small-cap peers. "We continue to favor US large cap Tech over its small cap counterpart, as it takes a highly speculative market (i.e. 2021) or Big Tech to fall out of favor (i.e. 2022, Q4 2024) for the latter to outperform," Nicholas Colas, the co-founder of the research firm DataTrek, wrote in a note.

August 06, 2025 10:38 ET | Source: Grabar Law Office Grabar Law Office PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC): Grabar Law Office is investigating claims on behalf of shareholders of Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC). The investigation concerns whether certain officers and directors breached the fiduciary duties they owed to the company. If you purchased Centene (NYSE: CNC) shares prior to December 12, 2024 and still hold shares today, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/centene-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085 to learn more. You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. WHY? As alleged in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint, Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC) provided investors with material information concerning Centene’s expected revenue guidance and adjusted diluted EPS for fiscal year 2025. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company’s enrollment and morbidity rates, as well as strong retention rates in Centene’s Medicare business. The Complaint alleges that Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Centene’s enrollment and morbidity rates. The Complaint claims that such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Centene’s securities at artificially inflated prices. WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW: If you purchased Centene (NYSE: CNC) shares prior to December 12, 2024 and still hold shares today, you are encouraged to visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/centene-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085.

If, alternatively, you purchased your shares between December 12, 2024, and June 30, 2025, you can participate in the class action. $CNC #Centene DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV): Grabar Law Office is investigating whether certain officers and directors of DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV) breached their fiduciary duties owed to the company. If you have held DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV) shares since prior to November 10, 2023, and would like to learn more about the investigation and your rights, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/doubleverify-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085. You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. Why? As alleged in an underlying securities fraud class action complaint, DoubleVerify (NYSE: DV), via certain of its officers, failed to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the above, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. What You Can Do Now: Current DoubleVerify (NYSE: DV) shareholders who have held DoubleVerify shares since prior to November 10, 2023, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to them whatsoever.

Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. $DV #DoubleVerify Napco Security Technologies, Inc.

Key allegations in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint against the company and certain of its officers have survived a motion to dismiss. That complaint alleges that Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC), through certain of its officers and directors, made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Napco failed to address any material weaknesses with internal controls regarding cost of goods sold ("COGS") and inventory; (2) Napco downplayed the severity of material weaknesses regarding their internal controls; (3) Napco’s unaudited financial statements from September 30, 2022 to the present included “certain errors” such as overstating inventory and understanding net COGS, resulting in overstated gross profit, operating income and net income for each period; (4) as a result, Napco would need to restate its previously filed unaudited financial statements for certain periods; and (5) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. On April 11, 2025, the federal court determined that key allegations would survive Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint. In so holding, the court determined “Plaintiffs have adequately stated Exchange Act claims by pleading scienter [knowledge of wrongdoing] through defendants’ unusual stock sales and by plausibly alleging loss causation between the corrective announcement and stock price drop. Plaintiffs have also stated Securities Act claims against Napco and the underwriter defendants.” . . . “Taking the well-pleaded facts as true, there is no question that plaintiffs have adequately pled scienter. First, the stock sales were highly unusual in timing and amount. As to amount, the total proceeds of over $108 million from stock sales by the officer defendants weigh in favor of a motive. . . . And the officer defendants sold hefty percentages of their holdings – 48.5% for Soloway and 45.5% for Buchel.” What To Do Now: If you have held Napco shares since before November 7, 2022 and would like to learn more about this matter, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H.

A recently filed securities class action complaint alleges that, Treace Medical Concepts, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMCI), via certain of its officers, made materially false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, the Complaint alleges Defendants failed to disclose that: (1) competition impacted the demand for and utilization of its primary product, the Lapiplasty 3D Bunion Correction System; (2) as a result, Treace Medical’s revenue declined, and the Company needed to accelerate its plans to offer a product that served as an alternative to osteotomy (a surgical procedure involving the cutting and realignment of a bone to improve its position or function); and (3) Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

Title: 'Bond King' Bill Gross made millions betting against GameStop. He says the stock is behaving like bitcoin now.

Bill Gross says he's steering clear of the latest crop of meme stocks for now, despite making millions of dollars betting against GameStop and AMC in the past. The billionaire investor told Business Insider he had "no interest" in Opendoor, Kohl's, American Eagle, and other stocks whose prices spiked as buzz on Reddit and other social media spurred retail traders to pile in. Day traders have Microsoft and Meta "to play with for now," Gross said. The tech titans are up 30% and 25% respectively this year because of AI excitement. Gross — known as the "Bond King" for growing fixed-income titan PIMCO's flagship Total Return Fund to $270 billion over nearly 30 years — said the stock that started it all, GameStop, is "not behaving like a meme" and is "much less volatile" than before. He added that he still viewed it as a "good candidate for option selling." Gross said the stock "seems to mimic bitcoin," the most valuable cryptocurrency, known for its volatility and passionate fanbase. Bitcoin's price fell by a quarter between early January and early April this year, but has rallied to record highs of above $110,000. GameStop announced its first bitcoin purchase in late May, securing 4,710 tokens worth around $537 million at current prices. Adjusted for a stock split in 2022, GameStop soared from around $1 in the summer of 2020 to a peak intraday price of $121 on January 28, 2021. It has traded within a much tighter range of around $20 to $35 over the past 12 months. It followed a similar trajectory to bitcoin by rising sharply in the fourth quarter of 2024, slumping this spring, and rebounding through early June. However, GameStop then fell after disappointing first-quarter earnings and dilutive share sales, whereas bitcoin kept climbing to fresh highs in July. Gross bet against GameStop by selling call options at the height of its meme-stock surge in January 2021. An options contract gives the buyer the right to purchase or sell a stock at an agreed price within a set period. Sellers wager these contracts will expire worthless, and they can simply keep the premium paid by the buyer. Gross was $15 million in the red, losing sleep at one point as GameStop kept climbing, but he doubled down. He later said he made between $15 million and $20 million betting against GameStop and AMC. "I knew I had an advantage over Reddit and the boys," Gross has said about his original meme-stock wagers, as he had access to real-time options and volatility data on his Bloomberg terminal. Gross has been a vocal skeptic of meme stocks for years, calling them "lottery tickets" and describing buyers of overpriced options as "fish at the poker table." He's also said that each buying frenzy ends with a "musical chair, me-first exit" from the stock. Besides GameStop and AMC, Gross also sold put and call options on Trump Media in the spring of 2024 to cash in on the craze around the president's stock.

Title: Colleen DeCourcy retired from advertising once. She’s not doing it again
URL: https://www.thedrum.com/news/2025/08/06/colleen-decourcy-retired-advertising-once-she-s-not-doing-it-again
Time Published: 2025-08-06T10:58:00Z

Advertisement August 6, 2025 | 13 min read Listen to article 4 min Artificial intelligence is reshaping the ad industry at breakneck speed. In agencies around the world, creatives are contemplating an uncertain future, fearful that their job will be lost to a machine. If you’re fortunate to have enjoyed a 40-year career in advertising – to have worked on some of the most iconic campaigns for the biggest brands in the world and earned numerous accolades along the way – you might think it’s the perfect time to bow out. Why not enjoy the spoils and avoid the painful, challenging, frustrating (and, yes, perhaps exciting) process of adapting to a new reality? Well, just ask Colleen DeCourcy. She first announced her retirement from the industry in 2021, leaving Wieden+Kennedy a legend after almost a decade in leadership. Then, she was lured back into the industry for the top creative job at Snap. As she prepares to become a grandmother (“a nanna”), to twins no less, she decided to leave the tech giant. But she’s also decided that she isn’t ready to hang up her hat. The very thing that’s terrifying creative leaders might be the thing that keeps her in the industry. Sitting down with The Drum at the Cannes Lions Festival, she says: “Creative people, by their very nature, are worriers, and when you’re tasked with your core competency being to defend ideas in every situation possible, change is always frightening. But I do fundamentally believe that what’s at risk [with AI] is not creativity. What’s at risk is the size of the margins of the businesses that built things out to wrap around creativity. So I’m excited about what’s coming.” I had arranged to meet DeCourcy for a quick coffee at a nearby cafe after her appearance on the Palais main stage, where she interviewed Google DeepMind CEO Mustafa Suleyman – a divisive figure in creative circles. In front of a packed audience, she confronted the thorny subject of AI’s looming threat to the industry with unflinching honesty. Now, upon arriving for our rendezvous, a French waiter, comically irate just two days into the festival’s chaos, curtly tells us we can’t sit unless we eat. Seeing the panicked look in my eyes as I realize I won’t be able to scoff a croque monsieur before my next interview, DeCourcy winks and says she and her partner (Jason, joining her at Cannes for the first time) would gladly eat at what was a less-than-ideal spot when surrounded by endless gourmet options to allow us to finish the interview. “I’m not sure that I am going to retire this time,” she says mid-order, as if it’s just occurred to her. “I think it’s just about setting different boundaries. It’s very different to be – I’m going to say it because I think this industry can be ageist – 60 years old. I know who I am. I have the ability to set terms on how I want to work and look around to find things that are super exciting to me. Operationalizing an agency through Covid and a massive protraction of the industry… after all that, I said I was ready to retire as I couldn’t imagine [being at] an agency that wasn’t Wieden+Kennedy. And what’s happening for me now is that I can imagine applying my creativity to things that aren’t agency, right? Snap allowed me to figure that out.” DeCourcy is one of advertising’s most celebrated creatives, in large part because of her willingness and even comfort with working at the messy intersection of technology and creativity. She entered advertising in 1986 at Saffer Cravit & Freedman, briefly detoured into media and entertainment, and then returned in 1994. After stints at Spafax, Organic and JTW New York, she ended up at TBWA Worldwide as its first-ever chief digital officer, where she was at the sharp end of figuring out how clients should think about then-emerging platforms like MySpace, Facebook and Twitter. Those experiments in social media pushed her to start her own social media content and design shop, Socialisit, in 2011. But two years later, the big call came. Within 15 months of arriving at Wieden+Kennedy as creative director, DeCourcy had been made a partner, joining an exclusive club that included Dan Wieden, president Dave Luhr and Susan Hoffman. It was the fastest anyone had made partner at the agency, and she went on to become its co-president and chief creative officer, working on campaigns for clients ranging from Nike and McDonald’s to Airbnb and Meta along the way. She also launched its tech and innovation lab, The Lodge, in 2013, where she encouraged creatives to think about how VR, AR and artificial intelligence could be applied to client briefs. Under her steerage, the global agency enjoyed one of its most successful eras, amassing 149 Lions at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. Advertisement DeCourcy announced her retirement from advertising in 2021. But within a year, she was back to the grind as chief creative officer at Snap. This wasn’t in her plans. She has had conflicting feelings on Big Tech and the impact social platforms like Meta have on society. She “got in trouble”, she says, for an article in Time Magazine titled ‘Is it moral to have Facebook as a client?’ in which she admitted her fears about the giants’ influence. So how did she end up running the creative department at a billion-dollar platform? People she “really cares about” on the Snap board convinced her to meet with the CEO, Evan Spiegel, initially. “Ending up at Snapchat was directly related to [the Time Magazine article]. I spoke to him about his intentions. I looked at all the research on the impact of that platform. I don’t even want to go into all the details of why it’s different, but I will tell you, Snap is built to not do the specific things that I was so afraid of with social media. “When I joined, I felt I had an obligation to prove that. I can’t call something out and then go and wash my hands. People want to communicate through technology. Young people love social platforms. So the trick was to find one that’s not damaging and help it become essential. It wasn’t an incongruity. It was an intentional decision.” Unlike her tenure within agency walls, where she had been the instigator to embrace new tech, her role in a place already at the cutting edge was to prove the power of brand, storytelling and creativity. “There was no universe built around the sanctification of my creativity,” she says, reflecting on the three years she spent at the company. The big brand thinking, helping Snap work out its place and how it wanted to communicate that, was something she “could do in her sleep”. What was less easy was doing that at the “speed, the velocity” that Silicon Valley demands. Engineers wanted instant work promoting the latest update, Wall Street reacted to every launch, and the relentless news cycle influenced messaging daily. But the biggest culture shock from leaving the world of agencies, she says, was the removal of any friction. “Removing friction from agreement is how you move fast. And that’s not great for creative work. When I worked in an agency and we walked in to pitch ideas to a client, there were two bosses in the room, one on their side, one on our side. There was the CMO and me. And their team had to get me excited, and my team had to get the CMO excited. And we found a way to get there,” DeCourcy explains. “When you work in-house, the person paying you is also the person who wants this thing, and there’s very little allowance for friction. And it’s a tech company that moves at the speed of light. You can very easily start to make anodyne work that makes a lot of sense, but doesn’t break through, that isn’t scary.” She adds: “But I’m grateful it was Snap, and Evan, as there was some allowance, some space, for that.” Take its first Oscars TV spot, which ran in 2022. She tied the campaign to Best Picture winner Coda, the first film to star a predominantly deaf cast in leading roles, and worked with SignAll to develop Lenses that could help Snapchat users learn ASL. Its most recent ‘Less Social Media, More Snapchat’ campaign was the culmination of her efforts to assert Snap’s position, highlighting the fundamental differences between it and other social media platforms. Users had steadily grown during her time with the company, but as ever, the question of how to monetize them arrived. Internally, it became “a dead heat” on whether to continue to grow users or ad sales. And as the pendulum began to swing back to a focus on product and performance marketing, she knew her time at Snap had come to an end. “I knew it the second I reached the moment when it was time for a real marketer, not a creative director,” she says. “They’ll need someone like me again in the future. But that’s not what excites me. And Evan was gracious enough to hear that and be kind.” So, where does she go from here if she’s not ready to retire? Well, no one knows yet. Not even DeCourcy. The challenge facing agencies as they grapple with AI and how it will upend the business model is something we talk about at length. She has little sympathy for holding companies under the cosh as they face ever-tightening margins after decades of putting an expensive wrapper around their creatives. They brought in a “vast number” of people and charged for services layered on services, and that’s “what’s going away.” “What we do in defense is say it’s coming for creativity,” she says. “And I look at most of those places and think, as a creative, I was often one-third of the workforce, right? And it’s not coming for me. It’s not coming for us.” Advertisement DeCourcy believes the solution is to follow the lead of Jean Marie Dru and Lee Clow, who have long advocated for agencies to adopt a model that charges for big, share-price-moving ideas. Ideas like those she orchestrated for long-term client Nike while she was at W+K. The ‘Dream Crazy’ campaign was credited by some as driving a 5% increase in the retailer’s stock price. That’s the kind of big-picture, culture-defining work no AI model could conceive. “I have not been one who has ever been fearful of tech,” she says. “Now is a really interesting moment. We’ve seen it come for the industries around us, and if you sit in meetings at a sales level, and you listen to the kinds of things that are being said about what will happen with ads, it could be alarming for an agency. But then you realize what the long-term gainer of this thing is [for creatives]. And it really is exciting to me as a creative person, playing with the tools, to get ready for this.” As the surly waiter returns with her lunch, I leave with one final question. As someone who relishes making sense of the complex world of tech and creativity, who loves the “friction” in solving seemingly impossible problems, could she not be tempted back to an ad agency? To be at the coal-face in this new era as they experiment with new ways of working? “You always like to say, ‘I don’t know, maybe’ [I’ll go back to an agency]. But no, I need to make room for other people in that space. I had a glorious career. I loved it. I loved the era in which I did it. And I’m excited about the other things that I’m finding in the world.” Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team.

AMD Q2 2025 earnings showed a mixed performance—while profits stayed flat, revenue beat expectations thanks to booming AI chip demand. AMD reported $7.7 billion in revenue and projected a strong Q3 forecast of $8.7 billion, driven by growing sales of its MI300 and upcoming MI400 AI accelerators. Despite this, AMD stock dipped over 3% due to export concerns and high valuation pressure. Uncertainty around U.S. restrictions on AI chip sales to China remains a hurdle. Still, AMD is positioning itself as a strong player in the AI space.

August 05, 2025 16:15 ET | Source: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. SANTA CLARA, Calif., Aug. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2025. Second quarter revenue was a record $7.7 billion, gross margin was 40%, operating loss was $134 million, net income was $872 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.54. On a non-GAAP(*) basis, gross margin was 43%, operating income was $897 million, net income was $781 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.48. As previously announced, our second quarter results were impacted by the U.S. Government's export control on our AMD Instinct™ MI308 data center GPU products. For the quarter, these restrictions led to approximately $800 million in inventory and related charges. Excluding these charges, non-GAAP gross margin would have been approximately 54%. “We delivered strong revenue growth in the second quarter led by record server and PC processor sales,” said Dr. Lisa Su, AMD Chair and CEO. “We are seeing robust demand across our computing and AI product portfolio and are well positioned to deliver significant growth in the second half of the year, driven by the ramp of our AMD Instinct MI350 series accelerators and ongoing EPYC and Ryzen processor share gains.” “We achieved 32% year-over-year revenue growth and generated record free cash flow this quarter, reflecting our disciplined execution,” said Jean Hu, AMD EVP, CFO and Treasurer. “Our strategic investments across hardware, software and systems position us well to support robust future growth and drive long-term shareholder value.” GAAP Quarterly Financial Results Non-GAAP(*) Quarterly Financial Results Segment Summary Recent PR Highlights Current OutlookAMD’s outlook statements are based on current expectations. The following statements are forward-looking and actual results could differ materially depending on market conditions and the factors set forth under “Cautionary Statement” below. For the third quarter of 2025, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $8.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million. At the mid-point of the revenue range, this represents year-over-year growth of approximately 28% and sequential growth of approximately 13%. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 54%. Our current outlook does not include any revenue from AMD Instinct MI308 shipments to China as our license applications are currently under review by the U.S. Government. AMD TeleconferenceAMD will hold a conference call at 2:00 p.m. PT (5:00 p.m. ET) today to discuss its second quarter 2025 financial earnings results. AMD will provide a real-time audio broadcast of the teleconference on the Investor Relations page of its website at www.amd.com.

Investors are urged to review in detail the risks and uncertainties in AMD’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including but not limited to AMD’s most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. (1) The Company operates as three operating segments, Data Center, Client and Gaming, and Embedded segments. The Data Center segment primarily includes Artificial Intelligence (AI) accelerators, server microprocessors (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), accelerated processing units (APUs), data processing units (DPUs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Smart Network Interface Cards (SmartNICs) and Adaptive System-on-Chip (SoC) products for data centers. The Client and Gaming segment primarily includes CPUs, APUs, and chipsets for desktops and notebooks, and discrete GPUs, semi-custom SoC products and development services. The Embedded segment primarily includes embedded CPUs, GPUs, APUs, FPGAs, System on Modules (SOMs), and Adaptive SoC products. From time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its IP portfolio. All Other category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the operating segments, such as amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, employee stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, inventory loss at contract manufacturer and restructuring charges. (2) Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA The Company presents “Adjusted EBITDA” as a supplemental measure of its performance. Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by adjusting GAAP net income for interest expense, other (income) expense, net, income tax provision (benefit), equity income in investee, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, inventory loss at contract manufacturer, acquisition-related and other costs, restructuring charges, and income from discontinued operations, net of tax. The Company calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of net income or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities that can affect cash flows. (3) Reconciliation of GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities of Continuing Operations to Free Cash Flow The Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations for capital expenditures, and free cash flow margin % is free cash flow expressed as a percentage of the Company's net revenue. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s calculation of free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities.

Title: Against The Grain: Analyst Targets $300K Bitcoin Price—When Will It Happen?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A well-known Bitcoin analyst is charting a path that most traders don’t expect. According to reports, the pseudonymous quant strategist PlanB told his 216,000 YouTube subscribers he believes Bitcoin will climb to at least $300,000 by the end of 2026. That’s a bold call, given that 60% of market participants think the world’s largest cryptocurrency won’t hit that mark in just one and a half years. Based on his stock-to-flow model, PlanB says Bitcoin’s built-in scarcity drives long-term value. He argues the model points toward an average of $500,000 per coin after the next halving. The stock-to-flow setup gives a wide range—from $250,000 at the low end to $1 million at the high end—but PlanB believes the center of that range is where Bitcoin is headed. His view flips the script on most forecasts today. The analyst is also keeping an eye on Bitcoin’s realized price. This metric looks at the price at which recent cohorts of coins last moved on-chain, then divides by the total supply. Since the current market price of $114,150—up 1% on the day—sits above every major cohort band, PlanB sees a classic bull-market pattern with no bear-market warning signs in sight. Based on data from price-forecast services, Bitcoin may average $112,000 this month of August, peaking near $114,800 and dipping to around $109,000. For September 2025, forecasts narrow to a band between $111,000 and $112,400, with an average close to $111,7002. Into 2026, some models see steady gains toward $194,000 by December, with highs above $225,000. According to market watchers, Anthony Scaramucci expects Bitcoin to top $170,000 within the next year. US President Donald Trump has not weighed in on crypto recently. Cathie Wood has her sights on $1 million per coin over the next five years. Digital Coin Price forecasts a swing to about $119,860 by mid-August 2025, then longer-term gains into the $210,000–$230,000 range during 2025. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor, Strategy Chairman, says Bitcoin’s limited supply and growing institutional interest could push it to $10 million, sparking fresh debate over its long-term role as a global asset. Based on analysis, investors should remember that models are tools, not guarantees. PlanB’s $300,000 call sits at the optimistic end of the spectrum. Others see more modest moves, while some have even larger long-term hopes. Whether Bitcoin follows its past cycles or breaks new ground, it’s clear the debate over its next big run is only getting started. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

August 05, 2025 08:41 ET | Source: Grabar Law Office Grabar Law Office PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC): Grabar Law Office is investigating claims on behalf of shareholders of Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC). The investigation concerns whether certain officers and directors breached the fiduciary duties they owed to the company. If you purchased Centene (NYSE: CNC) shares prior to December 12, 2024 and still hold shares today, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/centene-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085 to learn more. You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. WHY? As alleged in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint, Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC) provided investors with material information concerning Centene’s expected revenue guidance and adjusted diluted EPS for fiscal year 2025. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company’s enrollment and morbidity rates, as well as strong retention rates in Centene’s Medicare business. The Complaint alleges that Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Centene’s enrollment and morbidity rates. The Complaint claims that such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Centene’s securities at artificially inflated prices. WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW: If you purchased Centene (NYSE: CNC) shares prior to December 12, 2024 and still hold shares today, you are encouraged to visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/centene-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085.

Key allegations in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint against the company and certain of its officers have survived a motion to dismiss. That complaint alleges that Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC), through certain of its officers and directors, made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Napco failed to address any material weaknesses with internal controls regarding cost of goods sold ("COGS") and inventory; (2) Napco downplayed the severity of material weaknesses regarding their internal controls; (3) Napco’s unaudited financial statements from September 30, 2022 to the present included “certain errors” such as overstating inventory and understanding net COGS, resulting in overstated gross profit, operating income and net income for each period; (4) as a result, Napco would need to restate its previously filed unaudited financial statements for certain periods; and (5) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

In so holding, the court determined “Plaintiffs have adequately stated Exchange Act claims by pleading scienter [knowledge of wrongdoing] through defendants’ unusual stock sales and by plausibly alleging loss causation between the corrective announcement and stock price drop. Plaintiffs have also stated Securities Act claims against Napco and the underwriter defendants.” . . . “Taking the well-pleaded facts as true, there is no question that plaintiffs have adequately pled scienter. First, the stock sales were highly unusual in timing and amount. As to amount, the total proceeds of over $108 million from stock sales by the officer defendants weigh in favor of a motive. . . .

Title: King Princess’s Homecoming

Time Published: 2025-08-05T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
After the Civil War, the German-born Jewish businessman Isidor Straus moved with his family to New York City. Straus was enterprising and handsome, with small round spectacles, an angular nose, and a coarse, peppery beard. He started off as a crockery vender; by the turn of the twentieth century, he had made millions as a co-owner of Macy’s, befriended Grover Cleveland, served a year in Congress, and fallen in love. His wife was Rosalie Ida Blun, with whom he shared a birthday and seven children. On April 10, 1912, Isidor and Ida boarded the Titanic. She would decline a lifeboat, refusing to be separated from her husband. In James Cameron’s 1997 film, they embrace each other in bed, weeping, as the ship sinks. “I like to imagine they were thinking, ‘This is going to be a movie, we need to get our screen time,’ ” their great-great-granddaughter, Mikaela Straus, told me, taking a hit of a blunt on her couch, in Brooklyn. The last of her line of inheritance had been spent long before she was born. She’s bemused by suppositions about the advantages of her family legacy, which in reality boasts a centuries-deep ledger of addiction, estrangement, and untimely death. Only twenty-six, Mikaela, under the moniker King Princess, has begun to establish a musical legacy all her own. Over the past decade, she’s cultivated a reputation for a new kind of defiant, autodidactic pop stardom. Next month, she will release her striking third album, “Girl Violence”—her best yet—which cements her status not only as a virtuosic provocateur but as a generational talent. When Straus was seventeen, she wrote and produced her first single, a lesbian pop song that would eventually go platinum. It was her first semester at U.S.C.’s Thornton School of Music, and she was showering in her dorm suite when she started to hum a new melody. She ran, naked and dripping wet, out of the bathroom, and frantically asked a roommate for their phone. Into it, she recorded the first few phrases of what would become “1950,” a snappy serenade to a crush that has since accrued over half a billion streams. Straus had grown up in a recording studio, where she’d developed a shrewd understanding of pop arithmetic. Blending the honeyed soul of old-school crooners with the synthesized beats that dominated the airwaves and dance floors of her adolescence, she introduced audiences to what would become the King Princess sound: sexy, plaintive vocals, thrumming bass lines, and a fusion of digital and analog instrumentation. Shortly after the release of “1950,” in February, 2018, Harry Styles posted the lyrics on Twitter, garnering hundreds of thousands of likes overnight. Straus would go on to perform the song on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” then on “Saturday Night Live.” What made “1950” ’s success unique was its refusal to conform to the expectations of a Billboard-charting ballad; in a swirl of doo-wop snaps and reverb, it told a defiant, elliptical ode to gay history. “I hate it when dudes try to chase me,” Straus sings, in a raspy alto: But I love it when you try to save me’Cause I’m just a ladyI love it when we play 1950So cold that your stare’s bout to kill meI’m surprised when you kiss me The chorus toys with the erotics of bygone danger—conflating the perils of mid-century homophobia with a modern lover’s desire to play hard to get. “I was just thinking about how sad it is that we, you know, are horny for our own oppression,” she quipped on a podcast. Straus, who knew she was queer before she could write her name, was a lonely child. Though her parents were largely supportive of her sexuality, others were not: when she walked down the streets of New York holding hands with girlfriends as a young teen-ager, passersby would hurl expletives, slurs, and occasional threats. For company, she turned to literature—Radclyffe Hall’s “The Well of Loneliness,” Rita Mae Brown’s “Rubyfruit Jungle,” Nella Larsen’s “Passing,” Fannie Flagg’s “Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe.” She particularly loved “The Price of Salt,” the only happy ending she encountered, and subsequently read every biography she could find of Patricia Highsmith and her lovers. She wrote the song as a way to reach across time toward them, to find a companion in history. That spring, the producer Mark Ronson heard Straus’s demos in an A. & R. meeting at Sony. They got dinner—a meeting she’s described wryly as a first date—and, struck by her raunch and then by her technical acumen, he signed her. (One of his favorite songs of hers is called “Pussy Is God.”) After Straus received an advance from Ronson’s imprint at Columbia Records, Zelig, one of the first things she did was pay off some forty thousand dollars in outstanding student loans. Her début EP, “Make My Bed,” opens with a prayer of thanks: “Eighteen years I spent / waiting for this.” In June, Straus told me how her time at the label ran its course. “We have enough documentaries about Britney Spears to know how it works,” she said, shrugging and packing her lip with Zyn, the nicotine pouches she’s substituted for a vaping addiction. She recalled how she and her mother—whom she jokes is the “D-list Kris Jenner”—had hired a lawyer to exegete every line of the contract for her, “and I still got fucked.” After seven years at Columbia, she left. “In L.A., I had become addicted to my own unhappiness. It reached a point where I was like, ‘I will die if certain things don’t change,’” she told me. “Mark was like a parent to me. He was gracious enough to let me go.” She made her new album, “Girl Violence,” free of oversight or contractual obligation, then scouted for distributors, landing with section1, the tiny partner label of the independent, Brooklyn-based Partisan Records. Their enthusiasm and compassion had surprised her. “I wasn’t used to people not caring about streams or views,” she told me. “Good art is not born out of fear.” Straus, whose elfin face is framed by a piecey shag, with arched pink lips, a delicate nose, and hazel eyes underscored by creases that make her look a little strung out, was setting up for her semi-regular queer costume party, BAZONGAS, at a warehouse in East Williamsburg. The theme was “Slut Funeral”—a celebration of her new album’s lead single, “RIP KP,” and her own symbolic rebirth—and a handful of employees from Partisan were moving a two-hundred-pound steel casket to the lip of a stage, which had been decorated with more than forty fake candles. Helping with the manual labor in a ribbed white tank top, shredded jeans, and Timberland work boots, she joked to me that she had no security concerns about throwing a party open to the public: “What are these, like, weird, funny lesbians going to do to me?” Her anxieties about the exposure had more to do with her own behavior. “I had decided in my head that I wanted to be of the people, and around people, and available to people, so what if I fucked up?” she told me. “What if I have too many drinks, or get embarrassed or defensive?” Straus modulates between a kind of studied languor and a firebrand’s stridency. “They’ve tried to media-train me at least eighteen times,” she said, within minutes of our first meeting. She repeatedly glanced at her publicity team as we spoke, even when they were out of earshot. The meta-acknowledgment of her ungovernability can seem strategic—as if it might make a journalist, or a collaborator, put less stock in her brash pronouncements. Chris Robbins and Brontë Jane, the married founders of section1, first met Straus over Zoom. It was Valentine’s Day, and Straus introduced herself to her prospective bosses by describing the lingerie her girlfriend had brought over. Robbins recalls thinking, “Only one of you exists in the world.” Straus was mouthy, sharp, and knowledgeable, recalling the punky theatrics of Courtney Love and Gwen Stefani, but the pair were most compelled by the paradox of a certain calculated authenticity—she wielded vulgarity with the choreographed poise of a clown. “It’s this idea of Mikaela as a total fucking rock star, but in the most self-aware, almost self-parodying way,” Jane explained. Straus’s approach to her new album reminded Jane of one of her favorite films, Ingmar Bergman’s “Persona,” in which a young nurse struggles to distinguish herself from her patient. The whole conceit of “King Princess” is arranged around a fun-house effect—seeing iterations of yourself that aren’t exactly you but which you nonetheless identify with. Straus took inspiration from the Surrealist French artist Claude Cahun (also androgynous and pseudonymous), whose uncanny self-portraits troubled the possibility of documenting a “real” self. “I still don’t know if I’m supposed to call her King Princess or Mikaela,” Hugh Jackman told me. He acted opposite Straus in the forthcoming film “Song Sung Blue”—her feature début—and, in April, invited her to join him onstage at his Radio City residency. They duetted Sonny & Cher’s “I Got You Babe,” and he recalled being taken by the immediacy of her performance. “She had rehearsed with the orchestra, but I felt like she was discovering the song for the first time as she sang it. That kind of confidence can’t be taught.” When Straus was a teen-ager, musician friends would designate certain sessions in the studio with her as “king princess days,” summoning a punk-diva spirit to the console: Mick Jagger in a bustier. (“I’m literally fifty-fifty,” Straus told me, of her gender. “There’s a huge disconnect between my body and my soul. I think that disconnect is powerful if it’s harnessed, but sometimes you wake up and you’re, like, ‘If I put clothes on this carcass, I’m going to kill myself.’ ”) Her relationship to womanhood, which has been fraught and erratic since a tomboyish childhood on the baseball team, relies on notions of drag and extravagance; if the standard is a caricature, she can’t fail in its execution. For her birthday, in December, she threw a Harry Potter-themed BAZONGAS and dressed in full prosthetics as a busty, camel-toed Voldemort. But the primary reason for dividing her identity is psychological. “It’s like E.M.D.R.,” she explained, referencing a form of therapy in which a patient alternates between positive and negative memories. “The whole thing is to create a safe place in your mind you can go to when things get overwhelming. King Princess is that for me.” Mikaela Mullaney Straus was born to Oliver Straus, a recording engineer, and Agnes Mullaney, who worked in fashion; they would separate by the time she turned three. The young Mikaela, responding to the fights whirling around her, began to lash out in turn. She also channelled her emotions into art. When she was six, her mother picked her up from a babysitter who informed her that Mikaela had written a song on GarageBand called “It’s O.K. to Be Wrong.” “Before I used music to impress anyone, I used music to cope with my very big feelings,” she told me. “I needed an outlet.” Mission Sound, an esteemed Brooklyn recording studio founded by Straus’s father, began in the cellar of the Williamsburg house where she grew up. At first, it was difficult to coax clients across the river—Oliver has described the neighborhood in the early nineties as “Siberia to Manhattan musicians.” Soon, though, he amassed an impressive portfolio of local artists, which now includes such hitmakers as Jack Antonoff, the National, and Shawn Mendes. After buying the two-story fixer-upper for seventy-five thousand dollars, Oliver invested in a Neve 8026 console that had been used by the likes of the Who and the Kinks. To accommodate the upgraded gear, he expanded his business into an old factory, where he still runs it, half a mile away. When Oliver and Agnes separated, she kept the house, and he moved into a small room next to the new studio. He installed a kitchenette and, in order to share custody of his daughter, built her a loft bed over his floor mattress. From the time that she could walk, Mikaela would sneak across the hall to play with whatever she could—microphones, guitars, keyboards, faders, all manner of expensive equipment that she regarded, to her father’s moderate distress, as toys. Musicians and audio engineers came and went, and Mikaela would sit on the couch behind them, imitating their riffs and vocal exercises. Sometimes a patron, taken by her precocity, would give her a lesson. She can play almost anything. (“I’m sort of a Swiss Army knife, except no woodwinds,” she told me.) When she was five, she finally earned her father’s praise by composing her first song, a clever jingle about her dog Jackie, and he recorded it on the Neve. But after he started a new family with a second wife, their relationship frayed. By the time she finished middle school, she’d taught herself to use the audio software Ableton Live so she could make music without him. “I think people think my dad was the type of person who could call up the head of a label and be, like, ‘My daughter!’ ” she told me. Instead, the chief privilege of her father’s profession was proximity. Through the studio, she’d met a songwriter who’d introduced her to a manager who’d introduced her to a producer, Mike Malchicoff, who helped her record “1950.” “If I was shit, nothing would’ve happened,” she said. (The bravado she traffics in can feel defensive, but not baseless.) Meanwhile, her mother’s house offered its own revolving door of mentors. Agnes, who has been sober for thirty-nine years, was a twelve-step sponsor, and the home was always bustling with guests from the program. Growing up, Straus said, “I was obsessed with very flawed people. You have to look at somebody’s character and be, like, ‘This is a good person, even though there’s fucked-up shit here.’ ” Agnes, aware that addiction ran in the family—she had met Oliver when both were in recovery—was terrified that similar dangers might befall her daughter. “For all the incredible patience she had with her sponsees, I got none of that,” Mikaela recalled. “But it was out of fear. And she was right.” In high school, she was disorganized and distracted. She attended Avenues, a private school in Manhattan, on financial aid and an arts merit scholarship. She smoked cigarettes in the bathroom, cheated on assignments, and rushed home to practice piano. That she was gay and believed she would one day be famous made her a tough hang for most. (“I don’t think I’m really that likable,” she once said, offhand.) But her difficulties in her weakest courses forced her to hone a different asset. She knew she needed to do something to distract her peers and instructors from a paucity of right answers—so she learned to make them laugh. Across thirteen slinky, dancey, scuzzy tracks, “Girl Violence” chronicles the frivolous, sexy havoc Straus has seen women wreak on one another’s lives. Almost all the associated visuals and concepts were her ideas. The cover art, an out-of-focus closeup of Straus’s face, pays homage to Blur’s self-titled album. The music video for “RIP KP” finds Straus, after a car wreck, in gay Hell: a place where strippers in leopard print strain Martinis through their toes and the bathroom attendant accepts tips below the skirt, placing them in the open maw of a muppet merkin. The record, which was completed late last year, got its start in the winter of 2022, after her sophomore venture, “Hold On Baby,” saw critical acclaim but only modest commercial returns. She had been working on a collection of new songs, including “Cry Cry Cry,” a bratty diss track with an infectious bridge. The label wasn’t sold. Straus was increasingly miserable in Los Angeles, navigating the breakdown of a four-year relationship and struggling to curtail her substance use. On a visit to New York, she met with two very different Brooklyn producers: Jacob Portrait, a warm but aloof multi-instrumentalist from the psych-rock band Unknown Mortal Orchestra, and Joe Pincus, an affable software geek who had programmed beats for Doechii and SZA. (“I think if you look at the three of us on paper, you’d be, like, how the fuck would this ever work?” Pincus said.) That summer, she left her label, her lease, and her relationship. It was time to go home. She returned to her mother’s house (and, as she made a point of mentioning when we met, now sleeps in the bed where she was conceived). In September of 2023, she booked a month at her dad’s studio with Portrait and Pincus. Oliver would make them dinner and pop his head in excitedly if he heard Mikaela shredding a guitar solo, but he mostly left them alone. “Having another cook in the kitchen, especially her dad, was not something Mikaela was interested in,” Portrait said. “He’s been in this business a long time. They both have really big opinions.” Eventually, Straus showed her father the finished record. He said that it sounded like Mission Sound. “That’s the highest compliment coming from him—that it sounds like his room,” she told me. Some of the new album is about her ex, including the swaggery, synth-heavy lament “Alone Again.” On the outro, Straus sings, “I got bigger dreams than being your baby / Honestly, I’m so relieved it’s over.” But “Girl Violence” is not a straightforward breakup album. Instead, it uses her heartbreak as a metaphor for other kinds of fissures and reinventions. On “Origin Story,” a hip-hop-percussive hero’s journey, she sings, I’ve had to face fire, fight fearand spend a lot of time in the mirrorI’m cool, I’m weirderYeah, I’m hot, I’m deeperI’m starting to feel myself again Until now, Straus’s work has flipped between styles like a jukebox. Unlike many popular artists, she was never classically trained or in any other bands, nor was she plucked from obscurity to perform assembly-line creations. More than anything, thanks to her childhood at Mission Sound, she was a mockingbird. Her discography feels like the output of, appropriately, a Zelig, rather than the committed expressions of a singular mind. Across two full-length albums, one EP, and a handful of singles, Straus has offered variations of R. & B., grunge, disco, electro-clash, funk, alternative, and soul. She has collaborated with Fiona Apple and the late Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins, performed onstage with Julian Casablancas and Florence Welch, and covered Neil Young, Cyndi Lauper, Hole, Soundgarden, and the Velvet Underground (twice). She was raised on Led Zeppelin, Prince, David Bowie, and Jack White; she worships the Beatles’ live sessions. Identifying the latent similarities among her influences and doing away with anything ornamental or aspirational, “Girl Violence” finds its footing in late-nineties electronic rock. (“I feel like my live show has always been a rock show, even when I’m playing pop music,” she said. “Which is just to say that genre is meaningless.”) It’s her happiest album, sonically and lyrically, with only one ballad: the closer, “Serena,” which is a lullaby to a friend. “Cry Cry Cry,” released last month as the second single, is the standout. Its opening line—“Well, fuck me, I thought we were friends”—recalls the whiny yowls of Blink-182’s Mark Hoppus. It also highlights the greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts effect of the producing trio’s differences: Pincus, who has been nominated for a Grammy, brought his pop expertise, shoring up the twinkly harmonies and tight ’NSync drums, while Portrait drew on his background in the D.I.Y. scene, complimenting Straus’s pastiche bravura with a rough-edged Wheatus sleaze. Pincus’s textures are contemporary, but the references and use of real instruments by the other two make the finished product feel timeless. Straus, Pincus, and Portrait engineered “Girl Violence” themselves, forgoing the type of celebrity mixers she’d hired in the past. This time, wanting to figure out what “King Princess” actually sounded like, Straus went her own way. On a punishingly hot Wednesday night in June, Straus hosted a surprise preview show for “Girl Violence” at Market Hotel, an intimate, grimy standing-room venue that rattles when the subway passes. Save for the première of “RIP KP” on “Colbert” the night prior, it was her first time performing before an audience in years, and she was nervous, hiding out beforehand in the green room with her girlfriend. She would play the album all the way through with a mostly new band, in addition to her longtime drummer, Antoine Fadavi, and her bassist, Logan McQuade, who’d been beside her at the first-ever King Princess show, a Halloween party in 2017. (She was Ripley from “Alien”; he was a vague approximation of Jack Black in “School of Rock.”) “I can’t imagine being on stage without him,” she confessed, in a rare fit of sincerity. Straus shook off her dread as security guards escorted her through the crowd, teen-age girls squealing and clawing at her as she passed. “I missed you, New York,” she yelled under a rosy spotlight, wearing another skintight white tank top, this one bearing the name of her record across the chest. Hundreds of fans roared back. A louche, old-school performer, she channels Robert Plant and Iggy Pop, and elicits similar erotic zeal from her audience. As she sang, even with a guitar strapped to her shoulder, she ran her fingers up and down the mike stand, along her bare stomach, and through her curls, dripping with sweat. The new record is full of horny couplets, which she discharged without flinching. When she paused to slug a cherry-red cocktail, a fan screamed, “I love you!” The gig, which had sold out in nine minutes, was all-ages. Hours before showtime, dozens of young people, mostly queer women, had begun lining the noisy Bushwick block outside. Two sixteen-year-olds in baby-doll dresses and smears of thick eyeliner had come up from Long Island. “It’s hard to find people like this where I’m from,” one of them told me shyly. Nearby, a woman in her mid-fifties, who had taken the train in from Philadelphia for the set, waited for her wife to bring back drinks from the bar. She emphasized how much it meant to her to be in a majority-gay space. She’d grown up in the Pennsylvania suburbs and had come out, catastrophically, at thirteen; this year alone, more than a dozen anti-L.G.B.T.Q. bills have been proposed in her state. What she loved most about Straus, she said, was that “she’s unapologetically queer.” Toward the end of the set, Straus introduced a bluesy rendition of “1950” by entreating the crowd to sing along. “If you think about it, this is really where the girl violence started,” she said, taking a seat at the piano. “Crying over some pussy, as it goes.” Straus appreciates the environment at her shows, where, she told me later, “I’ve seen people get fingered, but I’ve never seen a fight.” She was sitting in the greenroom, curled up on a mottled brown-leather couch. “Sometimes,” she said, resting her head on her knees, “you’ll finish your set and a kid will come up to you and be, like, ‘I got kicked out of my house. I have forty dollars, and I bought this ticket.’ It really fucking changes things when you hear that.” She seemed offended when I asked if it ever felt like too much to bear. “I think part of the job of an artist is to be a listener. It’s not just about talking and playing and performing. It doesn’t take anything away from me—it gives me a reason to do this other than myself.” A week after Market Hotel, Straus was ready to let me see her home. “I need to smoke a blunt,” she said, leading me through a manicured courtyard with patio furniture and hydrangeas, where she sometimes inflates a kiddie pool for her dog, Raz, a six-year-old border-collie mutt who met us at the door. (The previous owners had named her after her affinity for raspberry White Claw.) Straus knelt down and let Raz kiss her face. “I’ve had her since she was five months old,” Straus told me, massaging the floppy ears with her thumbs. She led me upstairs so she could change into a pair of athletic shorts. I asked if the room had been her parents’. “Just my mom,” she said quickly. Behind her, the bed was neatly made, and an A.C. unit ruffled the leaves of a plant that hung off her armoire. When Straus got into U.S.C., her mother relocated with her third husband to Hawaii, where she keeps horses. Straus moved into her dorm room with the help of her manager rather than a parent. “She comes to New York a lot, and we talk on the phone every day,” Straus said. “But it is far. She missed the last show, which I know was hard for her.” On her upper arm is a tattoo of a bridle bit under the word “MOM.” Afterward, Straus rolled her contraband at the kitchen island and lit up, offering me a hit. (I politely declined.) On the walls hung White Stripes, T. Rex, and Yeah Yeah Yeahs posters. In her living room, PlayStation controllers, bundles of sage, a medieval sword, and packs of Zyn were shelved together under a glass coffee table. A nine-foot-tall stand of books—among them, the collected poems of Emily Dickinson, a Lou Reed biography, and “Gimpel the Fool,” by Isaac Bashevis Singer—was topped with a stack of wigs. “There are wigs everywhere, if you want to wear one,” she said, following my gaze. Would it make her more comfortable if I made a fool of myself? She told me that it would. Scattered among novelty objects, including a wax candle of a woman’s crotch and a signed portrait of RuPaul, were accolades from her career: late-night-show call sheets, an “S.N.L.” plaque, and the framed platinum vinyl for “1950.” For every measure of her efforts, there has to be a punch line to undercut it, or perhaps to make it seem all the more impressive. She kicked back on a sectional, letting Raz splay across her lap, and I asked what she hoped people might take away from “Girl Violence.” She hit the blunt contemplatively, and then answered. “I hope that it just feels like I’m having fun.” ♦

Title: The fall of Elon Musk down Fortune’s 100 Most Powerful People in Business list shows how power is impermanent

Diane Brady is an award-winning business journalist and author who has interviewed newsmakers worldwide and often speaks about the global business landscape. As executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative, she brings together a growing community of global business leaders through conversations, content, and connections. She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. Fortune’s 2025 ranking of the world’s 100 most powerful people in business came out this morning. Unlike revenue or market cap, power is a more complex concept. We calculate not just the size of the person’s businesses, but also the health of their companies, as well as their innovation, influence, impact and where they are in the arc of their career. By those measures, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang came in No. 1 on this year’s list. In addition to creating specialized computer chips that are coveted by companies developing artificial intelligence, he is on the front lines of a technology that is changing the global business landscape itself. Power is not permanent. Elon Musk topped last year’s list not only because of his roles at Tesla, SpaceX, xAI and X, but also because of his work in the Trump Administration. That changed. This year, Musk is No. 4 on the list. Power is also relative. Companies and leaders grow strong when they have a worthy rival to measure themselves against. Thus Jensen Huang has AMD CEO Lisa Su, his first cousin once removed, on his heels as a powerful chipmaker. As part of this year’s package, we look at how rivalries in key industries are playing out. You can check out the full list here. Federal grand jury will probe Trump’s “Russia hoax” allegations Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed a U.S. attorney to empanel a grand jury to investigate the intelligence community’s handling of allegations that Moscow had influence over President Trump’s 2016 election campaign. No targets were named, but the investigation will likely look at Obama-era cabinet members such as former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey. Trump threatens yet more tariffs on India over Russian oil purchases India got a 25% tariff rate in the last round, but the president is angry that India continues to buy Russian oil. “India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian Oil, they are then, for much of the Oil purchased, selling it on the Open Market for big profits. They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine,” he said on Trump Social. India said this was hypocrisy because the EU continues to trade with Russia and faces no similar sanctions. Palantir delivers blowout quarter Sales were up almost 50% to nearly $1 billion, beating expectations. Net income was $327 million, up 144%. CEO Alex Karp lifted guidance for Q3. The stock closed up 4% yesterday and rose another 5% in overnight trading. “We’re planning to grow our revenue … while decreasing our number of people,” CEO Alex Karp told CNBC. “This is a crazy, efficient revolution. The goal is to get 10x revenue and have 3,600 people. We have now 4,100.” Deutsche Bank CEO approved trades that were later investigated Christian Sewing approved a €1.5 billion deal that was later investigated by Italian authorities, resulting in six of his former colleagues being sentenced to prison on false accounting charges. The convictions were later overturned on appeal. Deutsche Bank denied there was any wrongdoing on Sewing’s part: “Any allegation of a conflict of interest involving Christian Sewing is completely unfounded,” it told the FT. Trump wants to ban “debanking” The president is planning to issue an executive order directing bank regulators to investigate whether banks deny accounts to people with right-wing opinions or those involved in crypto, to see whether such bans might violate credit, consumer, or antitrust laws. JPMorgan strategist sounds alarm on labor demographic issues David Kelly, JPMorgan Asset Management’s Chief Global Strategist, warned on Monday that immigration restrictions and a growing elderly population could mean “no growth in workers at all” in the next 5 years. Kelly warned that cutting rates could lead to wage and price inflation instead of propelling economic growth. Anthropic CEO on Meta’s poaching Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei says the company’s employees have been less eager to accept poaching offers from Meta and the company won’t make competing offers because that would jeopardize company culture. “We are not willing to compromise our compensation principles, our principles of fairness, to respond individually to these offers,” Amodei recently said on the Big Technology Podcast. S&P 500 futures were up 0.13% this morning, premarket, after the index closed up 1.47% yesterday. STOXX Europe 600 was up 0.3% in early trading. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was up 0.35% in early trading. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.65%. China’s CSI 300 was up 0.8%. The South Korea KOSPI was up 1.6%. India’s Nifty 50 was down 0.46%. Bitcoin remains above $114K.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: Lines are being drawn in Amazon and Google’s evolving rivalry

Hear from execs at The New York Times, Thomson Reuters, Trusted Media Brands and many others This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → Uncertainties over the impact of U.S. import tariffs, as well as the disruption of AI, are upending the global economic order. It might seem intuitive that Big Tech (as a collective) will be the big beneficiaries of such trends, but as the recent raft of quarterly earnings releases demonstrates, such players are repositioning, and the impact on Madison Avenue could potentially be seismic. Google-owner Alphabet was the first across the line, and in last week’s analysis, Digiday noted how ad tech is a declining priority for the Big Tech giant of Madison Avenue, with AI dominating Wall Street analysts’ questions (see right). As the remainder of ‘GAFAM’ – that’s Apple, Facebook (or Meta), Amazon, and Microsoft – followed suit with their results for the period, the AI-intrigue continued. However, for those paying close attention to how their priorities will impact the marketing and advertising market, there were some breadcrumbs pointing toward potential political ruptures, given how such players account for almost two-thirds of U.S. ad spend. Firstly, it’s worth clarifying how Google is far from a shrinking willow in the advertising market, given its $96.4 billion Q2 revenue haul – it’s still the clear pace-setter on Madison Avenue. And while its Google Network business, a.k.a. what was DoubleClick, is in continued decline, core platforms like Search and YouTube grew 12 percent and 13 percent, respectively, with analysts noting how it has shifted from an enabler of the ecosystem to a premium media owner, with its AI overviews also setting a new paradigm. Meanwhile, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg used this juncture to launch his “Personal Superintelligence” manifesto – for shareholders’ sake, let’s hope this one receives a warmer welcome than his metaverse prophecy. However, glib observations aside, Meta’s 3.4 billion-strong audience helped generate $47.5 billion during the same reporting period, up 22 percent year over year — a strong performance, indeed — with the Facebook and Instagram owner also underscoring its AI efforts. Ahead of any further analysis, it is worth reminding ourselves that Alphabet’s latest earnings suggest a strategic shift away from third-party ad tech dominance toward owned-and-operated platforms (not to mention AI), and it’s this shift in priorities that may focus Amazon Advertising’s energies in the near-to-mid-term. In its Q2 earnings update, Amazon reported $167.7 billion in revenue, a 12 percent increase from the year-ago period, according to the company’s latest earnings disclosure. According to the company’s executives, advertising played a key role in driving growth, a contrast to what several analysts deemed a worrying outlook for its AI investments. Understandably, Wall Street queries focused on hot-button issues, such as whether tariffs will impact Amazon’s core e-commerce business and its prospects in the ongoing AI land grab, with such developments casting an interesting light on its growing ads business. On the company’s subsequent earnings call, which took place ahead of the crunch tariff deadline from the U.S. administration, Amazon’s executives emphasized the unpredictability of the situation, with CEO Andy Jassy observing, “In the first half, we just haven’t seen diminished demand.” Given the broader AI narrative, many analysts’ questions centered on its AWS vertical, which generated $30.9 billion in revenue, a 17.5 percent year-over-year increase. Notably, Morgan Stanley’s Brian Novak bluntly articulated the perception that “AWS is falling behind with Gen AI.” Evidently, Jassy’s response did little to reverse such notions, with Amazon’s stock price dropping by 7 percent in the hours after the call. Meanwhile, the online giant’s advertising business had a significant impact on its bottom line, contributing $15.7 billion, a 22 percent year-over-year increase, or (more pertinently to the matter at hand) accounting for 9.4 percent of Amazon’s total revenue for the period. As Amazon CFO, Brian Lioswski, noted, “Advertising remains an important contributor to profitability in the North American [and] international segments.” Note how this contrasts with the way AWS margins “saw headwinds” during the reporting period, and as Lioswski also noted, “We expect AWS margins to fluctuate over time.” Amazon executives also highlighted some of its tentpole Cannes Lions announcements, such as its integration with Roku. All of this is understandable, particularly as analysts take an increasingly austere view of AWS’ outlook; after all, the high margins of digital advertising have created some of the biggest Big Tech behemoths. And that’s why the recent emergence that Amazon has abruptly cut its Google Shopping ad spending is causing speculation: could this be the start of a tit-for-tat trade war (of sorts) between a Big tech pairing who also happen to be two of Madison Avenue’s biggest spenders? One of the biggest stories on Madison Avenue over the past 12 months has been Amazon, specifically as an advertiser, awarding separate parts of its media account to different holding companies worldwide. It’s well understood that the unspoken horse-trading of winning such large accounts – separate estimates put Big Tech’s marketing spend in the range of $20 billion or more per year – involves a degree of deal-making. In the case of Amazon, several Digiday sources have speculated that awarding such a lucrative account would have involved an implied, if not outright stated, expectation that a certain percentage of spend will be channeled in the direction of its accompanying media business. If this is the case, will Google look to retaliate? Furthermore, more puckish observers might note that Google’s account review, which took place in 2021, saw it consolidate its media business within WPP’s Essence – the same business unit that won Amazon’s media business in Europe and APAC.Are these shifting tectonic plates signs of a brewing storm between the two that could have a scaled downstream impact? “Payor reliability is slipping — only 43 percent paid on time more often than not, with ‘always-on-time’ payors down to just 13 percent.” — OAREX evp Nick Carrabbia cites statistics from the company’s H1 2025 Payments Study. As YouTube Shorts reaches 200 billion views, advertisers increase their investment Brands now find Shorts a cost-effective way to reach audiences absent on TikTok and Instagram, with low CPMs around $5 — that’s half the cost of Meta Reels or TikTok, according to sources – proving a big draw. Enhanced monetization tools and creator incentives have also fueled growth, with advertisers accelerating their reallocation of budget to Shorts for more efficient reach and performance. Inside the search rumor swirling around Meta Amid a changing internet landscape, the old adage that “Google is for Search, Facebook is for Social…” is losing traction. Media buyers are inquiring about Meta’s new offering in this landscape, with sources expecting a search product to be introduced soon. YouTube is dominating TV viewership — but Amazon’s Prime Video is on pace to be a bigger cash cow Business Insider’s James Faris and Lucia Moses further chart the growing rivalry between the Big tech duo, with the living room screen seemingly one of the most intense battlegrounds. The EU’s Digital Fairness Act: Explained Videoweek’s Tim Cross-Kovoor explains how the EU is developing another piece of legislation targeting the tech sector, the Digital Fairness Act, designed to crack down on unfair and manipulative practices by digital businesses that harm consumers.

Title: Has The Crypto Market Bottomed? Analyst Says ‘This Is It’
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/has-the-crypto-market-bottomed/
Time Published: 2025-08-05T01:00:50Z
Full Content:
Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Macro analyst Alex Krüger says the weekend’s sell-off has likely marked a tradable low for the crypto market, arguing that the move closely mirrors the 2024 “August crash” that bottomed on a Monday. “I see the current move as a smaller scale replay of last year’s August crash (which bottomed on Monday),” Krüger wrote on late-Friday in a post on X, adding that he would “be looking to add to longs on Monday, ideally before the US cash open,” if the overnight session remained panicky. He framed the decline as a classic shakeout rather than the start of a new downtrend. Krüger’s read hinges on macro first, crypto second. He notes that 2024’s August break came in a sequence—BoJ tightening, a hawkish FOMC, then weak payrolls—and he sees the present sequence as “similar.” There was no carry-trade impulse this time, he said, but markets digested a modestly hawkish Fed, mixed Big Tech earnings, a hotter-than-expected PCE inflation print, and finally a “horrid” US payrolls report—after which risk assets slid in tandem and crypto tracked equities lower. The latest PCE data, released July 31, showed headline inflation accelerating to 2.6% year over year and core PCE at 2.8%, a notch above forecasts—what Krüger summarized as “slightly hot.” Earnings tape-bombs reinforced the risk-off mood. Microsoft and Meta beat estimates and initially rallied, while Apple’s reception was cooler and Amazon’s results were “very poorly received,” with AMZN sliding about 7–8% as investors questioned AWS’s momentum. Coinbase’s report landed at the other extreme for crypto beta: revenue missed expectations and the stock fell, a backdrop Krüger called “dreadful” for sentiment. “Even though the aforementioned concerns emboldened bears, this week’s move has been mainly a macro story, given how crypto traded mostly in line with equity indices,” he wrote. He also flagged an unusual political and geopolitical coda to this weekend’s rout. After the weak jobs report—plus an unusually stark revision by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, May and June were revised down by a combined 258,000 jobs—markets lurched, and the White House’s subsequent decision to reposition two US nuclear submarines amid heated exchanges with Moscow added to stress, he said. Kremlin officials later tried to downplay escalation risk, calling the submarine moves “routine.” Krüger called the nuclear rhetoric and presidential barbs at the Fed “noise” for markets, but said the combination likely helped flush leveraged positions into the close. On crypto-specific drivers, Krüger listed a cluster of narratives that, in his view, amplified bearish conviction without changing the macro center of gravity: disappointing Coinbase results; debate around whether MicroStrategy could curtail its at-the-market equity issuance, limiting incremental BTC buys; questions about the sustainability of “DATs” (digital-asset treasury companies) tied to ETH; and, on the other side of the ledger, the SEC’s new “Project Crypto,” a policy push to modernize securities rules and move more market infrastructure on-chain—“an extremely bullish development that should drive inflows later in the year,” as he put it. The SEC’s chair outlined “American Leadership in the Digital Finance Revolution” last week, framing tokenization and on-chain market plumbing as a regulatory priority. Krüger’s base case is timing-driven: either crypto “bottomed after today’s close, given the sheer violence of that final dump, or will be bottoming together with equities on Monday.” In his plan, the trigger to add risk was early Monday—assuming the overnight remained disorderly—on the view that the analog to August 2024 would rhyme at the turn of the week. “A violent shakeout,” he wrote, not a regime change. He remains constructive into the fourth quarter, citing three pillars: a still-solid US economy, the start of Fed rate cuts, and a steadily improving regulatory climate that should broaden institutional and retail participation. Policy churn could amplify that path. Krüger pointed to Fed Governor Adriana Kugler’s resignation—effective this month—as a potentially market-relevant shift because it hands the White House an earlier-than-expected Board vacancy, and to former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh’s call for a new “Treasury–Fed accord” as a signpost for constraints on central-bank independence. On Monday he added, “This will prove to be very important later on,” citing Warsh’s argument about “limits on the Fed’s independence to help the govt with its finances.” Whether those institutional dynamics translate into earlier or deeper rate cuts remains open, but markets have already moved to price odds to 85% for a September cut following the payrolls miss. Krüger’s longer arc is unabashedly bullish but explicitly conditional on the macro. “I remain bullish on crypto into Q4,” he wrote, while warning that ETH-linked treasury plays could “lose momentum dramatically” later in the year if goods inflation re-accelerates as corporates pass tariffs through. He set a one-year Bitcoin target for mid-2026 at $200,000–$250,000—“extreme, but possible”—on the premise that a more dovish Fed in 2026 would coincide with ongoing adoption. For now, he is treating last week’s cascade as an echo of 2024’s Monday bottom.

That was one theory that emerged as the company disclosed a surprising surge in iPhone sales in the April-June quarter, up 14% compared with the period a year earlier, handily beating estimates. Consumers, it was said, were rushing out to stores in fear that Donald Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ trade levies would drastically increase the cost of an upgrade; [reports had suggested that the price could have gone up by 43%]. It certainly makes some logical sense; though the data shows that the fears of consumers soon subsided. According to Placer.ai, which uses mobile location data to monitor foot traffic, elevated sales in the immediate days after Trump’s address rapidly petered out—visitors to US Apple stores were up just 0.93% for the entire fiscal quarter compared to a year earlier. Meanwhile, visits to Apple’s website from US consumers were down 3%, according to data from Similarweb. Also Read: Mint Quick Edit | India’s smartphone exports get buzzy in the US On a call with investors to discuss the results, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook acknowledged that tariff chatter did create unusual buying patterns in April, mostly around sales in the US of the iPhone and Mac computers. But overall, the boost was limited—Apple said just 1 percentage point of its 10% overall revenue growth came from these “pull forward" sales. If Apple’s analysis proves correct—and some analysts seemed sceptical, repeatedly asking for more details—then that would be good news. It means investors would have to worry less that the better-than-expected sales won’t mean a significant dip for the rest of this year. That’s not to say tariffs won’t be a drag— Cook said the company would take a $1.1 billion tariff-related hit in the current quarter, up from $900 million in the last. To emphasize the gusto of his most important product, Cook noted that somebody out there has the 3 billionth iPhone. That’s a staying power that will count for a lot as the company moves to this next era of uncertainty. Also Read: China plus one: Apple and India might need to woo not just Trump but Xi too The quarterly iPhone sales indicate that consumers don’t yet care that the bulk of the device’s artificial-intelligence (AI) features have yet to materialize—they’ll stick with Apple anyway. I found myself agreeing with Cook when he said he felt AI-specific devices—such as glasses from Meta Platforms Inc or whatever it is OpenAI and Jony Ive create—are “likely to be complementary devices, not substitution" for the smartphone. Still, AI is on the mind of investors, and the blockbuster quarter was not enough to distract from that; [notably, Apple’s stock has fallen by double digits since the beginning of the year]. The company reiterated its intent to increase spending to fund its AI efforts and to reallocate talent to speed things up. Cook didn’t, however, address the fact that some of his top AI talent has reallocated itself to Meta. The Apple boss’s apparent lack of interest in joining Big tech’s unprecedented talent war —one that would have made his predecessor, Steve Jobs, sick to his stomach—is one facet in Apple’s obvious unwillingness to follow its peers and bet the entire house on AI. Its capital expenditure, while growing, is expected to be tens of billions of dollars lower than that of other tech giants. The years to come will tell whether Apple was wise to separate itself from the pack. Also Read: Apple intelligence: It’s time to step up and speak out Tellingly, when asked last week whether Cook felt AI innovations like large language models might become commoditized, the CEO declined to answer. “That gives away some things on our strategy," he said. That could be read as a sign Apple doesn’t feel it needs to directly compete in building AI. I think this speaks of a confidence that the iPhone will still be the de facto device of choice for AI whether or not Apple is successful in making a competent ChatGPT of its own. Another interpretation is that Cook doesn’t want to show his hand in any merger and acquisition negotiations, but I guess we’ll see. Cook said on the call that he was “very open" to dealmaking—we’ll see what exactly he feels he needs to buy rather than build. Frankly, you didn’t need to see Apple’s numbers to know it had been a great quarter for the company—you could just listen to the tone of Cook’s voice. Noticeably upbeat as he ran through his remarks, the tenor of the call was in stark contrast from last quarter, when some (myself included) wondered whether the weight of Apple’s numerous challenges were starting to deplete the 64-year-old’s energy reserves. Talk of succession will surely quieten down for the foreseeable future: It’s time to let Tim cook. ©Bloomberg The author is Bloomberg Opinion’s US technology columnist.

Title: IDCC Hits Record Highs: Overheated Or Undervalued?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/08/04/idcc-hits-record-highs-overheated-or-undervalued/

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. InterDigital (NASDAQ: IDCC) has increased by 16% over the last five trading days, achieving record highs close to $258 per share (as of July 31), fueled by a significant $1.05 billion arbitration victory against Samsung. However, the pressing question for investors is whether this surge is still sustainable or if the stock has exceeded its fundamental values. At first glance, IDCC’s valuation appears stretched. It has a price-to-sales ratio of 7.8x and a price-to-free-cash-flow multiple of 52.4x, significantly higher than the S&P 500 averages. Moreover, its trailing P/E of approximately 20x exceeds its 3-year historical range of 14x. However, context is essential. These high multiples indicate a company that is quickly scaling revenues, increasing margins, and demonstrating the reliability of its licensing model. Thus, although the valuation is high, it is not unreasonable. Strong execution, premium margins, and financial flexibility warrant a higher multiple. Still, after such a significant increase, a short-term correction would not be surprising. That being said, for those looking for upside with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative – having outperformed the S&P 500 and delivered returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Additionally, see META Stock to $1,500? InterDigital’s strength is anchored in its asset-light, high-margin licensing model, which is supported by upstream R&D in 4G/5G/6G, video compression, and AI. It possesses a strong patent portfolio—many of which are standards-essential—licensed to major companies such as Samsung, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Xiaomi. With a net margin of 48.1% and an operating cash flow margin of 24.6%, IDCC stands out as one of the most profitable entities in its sector. The ruling by the International Chamber of Commerce in favor of Samsung added $131 million in annual recurring revenue—a 67% increase over the previous agreement—plus a $119 million catch-up payment for Q2. This significantly reduces the risk of near-term revenue fluctuations and reinforces InterDigital’s intellectual property strength in mobile, video, and AI standards. While Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM)experienced an 8% decline during the same week, IDCC rose as investors anticipated future cash flows and improved visibility. The Q2 2025 results showcased the company’s momentum. Revenue skyrocketed 34% year-over-year to $300.6 million, significantly exceeding expectations. Non-GAAP EPS was reported at $6.52—almost double the estimates—while GAAP net income saw a 65% increase to $180.6 million. Smartphone licensing revenue rose 18% to $235 million, and licensing revenue from Consumer Electronics/Internet of Things/Automotive surged 175% to $65 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 79% year-over-year. With an upgraded full-year revenue forecast of $790–850 million, along with $41.7 million returned to shareholders in Q2, InterDigital is effectively leveraging its scale and influence. InterDigital has exhibited remarkable growth, with revenues increasing at an average rate of 22.9% over the past three years—significantly outpacing the S&P 500’s 5.3%. In the last 12 months alone, revenue jumped 33.5%, compared to just 4.4% for the broader market. InterDigital boasts a 57.3% operating margin (versus 18.3% for the S&P 500), a net margin of 48.1% (compared to 11.8%), and a 24.6% operating cash flow margin (versus 19.8%). These outstanding metrics arise from its lean, asset-light model, where upfront R&D results in high-margin, recurring licensing income. Financially, the company is on stable ground, with a 7.7% debt-to-equity ratio and 47.4% cash-to-assets, both significantly better than S&P 500 averages. With $948 million in cash and $472 million in debt, InterDigital is strategically positioned to invest, absorb shocks, or expand without financial pressure. Although InterDigital has historically underperformed the S&P 500 during significant market declines, it has consistently shown faster recovery. During the 2022 inflation crisis, the stock dropped 52.5% but fully recovered within a year. During the 2020 COVID market crash, it fell 46.9% and bounced back in under six months. Even during the Global Financial Crisis, when shares fell by 53.5%, InterDigital regained its footing in roughly 2.5 years. While the stock is certainly volatile, its track record suggests strong long-term resilience. IDCC meets numerous criteria: substantial upside through IP licensing, best-in-class margins, and improved visibility due to recurring revenue. Although it may not yet be a multi-billion-dollar entity, it presents asymmetric upside with defensible growth drivers. Not too pleased with the volatile nature of IDCC stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising a selection of 30 stocks, has a proven track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past 4 years. What’s the explanation? On average, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother ride, as evidenced in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: How Jamie Dimon becomes Sam Altman’s biggest competitor

UPDATED 16:13 EDT / AUGUST 03 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante and George Gilbert Last November, we argued that JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon is sitting on a treasure trove of unique data that will never find its way into proprietary large language models via the internet. And as such, he was OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s biggest competitor because his data is more valuable than the democratized insights from these LLMs. Our premise was and continues to be that foundation model companies are waging an internecine battle chasing artificial general intelligence (“Messiah AGI”) and the true holy grail is what we called “enterprise AGI” — meaning applying AI to proprietary data inside of enterprises will ultimately prove to be the most valuable economic endeavor. Today we extend that argument and posit that agents and enterprise digital twins, powered by that proprietary data, will drive the next wave of AI value. In our previous “Jamie Dimon” episode, we set a framework for the why. In this Breaking Analysis, we explain how enterprises such as JPMC will drive value in a way that frontier model vendors cannot. We’ll examine our original premise and share data that further reinforces the challenges foundation model vendors face, making it a daunting business. Moreover, we’ll explain why agents, programmed by data, will ultimately provide the biggest value unlock for enterprises in the coming years. We think of agent evolution in three distinct waves as shown below: Consumer agents – ChatGPT in its GPT-3/4 era gave us the first taste of a personal digital assistant. GPT-5 will likely deliver the first general-purpose, consumer-grade agent that can act on a user’s behalf, not just chat. Coding agents – Anthropic’s Claude paired with Cursor shows what happens when you post-train with reinforcement learning onto a strong base model and aim it at software engineering. Code is a good proving ground because outcomes are objectively testable, much like math problems. Enterprise agents – We believe this is the next frontier – i.e. agents powered by a live digital twin of the business. Not digital twins of something physical such as a factory like Nvidia Corp.’s Omniverse, rather an enterprise. Here the landscape changes. It’s not just about bigger models; it’s new vendor tech stacks, new vendor business models, and new customer operating models that we’ll explain. The value is so large that even Jamie Dimon, with his huge balance sheet and orders of magnitude more useful data than frontier labs have access to, is stepping onto Sam Altman’s playing field. With that framing in place, let’s walk through why the jump from consumer/coder agents to enterprise agents is not a linear extrapolation, and what new technology and organizational layers have to materialize before Jamie Dimon can realistically challenge OpenAI’s lead. We make the following additional points on this topic: Dimon, as we’ve talked about before, is a proxy for enterprises and the proprietary data and know-how that they have within their four walls that frontier LLMs cannot train on. This is why the real value will come from enterprises applying that data and know-how to extending the frontier LLMs or models that are similar to that and we’ll explain why. The real revolution is that we’ve moved from scaling laws in the pre-training era—which is the GPT models that ChatGPT and similar products were built on, to the post-training era, which is where we start using reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is a fancy term for trial-and-error learning and, for trial-and-error, you have to be able to learn from your mistakes. So that’s where agents in the enterprise first take off. And then our contention is that to go beyond that is where we’re going to need a new type of technology platform — the enterprise digital twin. To get real value out of that, we’re going to have to go with a new—not just new technology model at the foundation where the data is — but a new operations model where firms have to organize around end-to-end outcomes like onboarding a new customer, not departmental or functional specialization. As such, we’re going to need lots of changes. And the main point is that Jamie Dimon (as a proxy for leading enterprises) and the value he’s going to extract from this era of AI is going to need completely different scaffolding and sets of business models for customers like him, as well as the vendors that supply him, compared to the era where ChatGPT is creating and capturing value today. In short, we believe this shift — from pre-training scale to post-training skill, and from siloed workflows to outcome-centric twins — sets the competitive chessboard for the next decade of enterprise AI. Let’s drill into the first wave a bit deeper ChatGPT on GPT3.5 got it all started. but GPT-5 is where we think ChatGPT’s real value as a general-purpose consumer agent begins. OpenAI’s own revenue projection (dotted red line below) climbs from low-single billions in 2024 to >$50 billion by 2027 — a growth curve that many people feel threatens Google Search – we’ll see. The red call-outs above are instructive as there are caveats, technical rewirings and business model changes that have to fall into place before GPT-5-class agents can move from cool demo to must-have personal assistant. Specifically: Thirty years ago investors hailed the commercial internet as the greatest legal creation of wealth in history. Today we hear equally grand pronouncements that generative AI surpasses fire, the wheel and electricity. GPT-5 will likely justify a good share of that hyperbole. By unifying multimodal reasoning — voice, video, tool use, research, code execution — OpenAI is poised to ship the first truly full-stack consumer agent, a blockbuster product by any historical yardstick. But the leap from headline to habit requires upheaval on multiple fronts: The headline is that GPT-5 can ignite massive consumer adoption, yet widespread value capture hinges on re-plumbing the web and re-monetizing content. That’s before we even tackle the additional hurdles unique to enterprise deployment, which carry their own technology, governance and operating-model demands. Before we get too excited about GPT-5, let’s stare at the brutal economics of scale. The data below tells a big story. Upper-right chart: That “scaling-law” line (log of compute petaflops for pretraining on the X-axis, log of test-loss, which is a fancy way of describing accuracy and the ability to recognize ever finer patterns, on the Y-axis) moves steadily down — but every inch of improvement demands an order-of-magnitude jump in PF-days (petaflop-days) of compute. Let’s unpack where the above numbers come from. On the slide above, the left axis shows estimated training cost per generation; the right axis plots the corresponding test-loss improvement. The $35 million mark for a GPT-3-class model is the common reference point. Each successive generation requires roughly a 10-times to to 30-times increase in training FLOPs, but after algorithmic and hardware efficiencies the all-in cash outlay still grows about five to 10 times each cycle. Numbers often look smaller because they capture only the final two- or three-month production run. That explains the confusion around DeepSeek’s reported $6 million cost; the figure omitted the research runs, data-ablation experiments and restarts that consume three to 10 times more compute before the last pass even begins. The slide’s curve makes a second point clear. Each jump in spend buys only an incremental drop in test loss — better predictive accuracy, more reliable answers, finer pattern detection. Keeping pace on pretraining alone is already pushing costs toward $10 billion for a single next-gen run. At that level the market cannot sustain many players unless they add a strongly differentiated layer on top of the base model. Coming bottlenecks in high-quality training data and intense competition will squeeze both the magnitude and the lifespan of any price premium on raw application programming interface access. Reinforcement-learning can address the law of diminishing returns by opening up a new scaling vector. And inference-time “reasoning” opens up yet another dimension of scaling. But the pretraining foundation still needs to keep advancing. This means the capital intensity of playing at the frontier model layer continues to increase exponentially. The economics of amortizing pretraining works as long as the end market continues to grow at a similar pace. But when the market growth slows, the cost of pretraining is going to look like a game of musical chairs when the music stops. So far we’ve focused on compute costs, but there’s an equally brutal constraint we need to discuss, which is that we’re running out of free, high-quality human text. The chart above tracks the “effective stock” of usable internet tokens (green band) versus the projected size of datasets consumed by frontier models (blue band). Those two curves meet around 2027-28 — meaning every extra point of model improvement will require new strategies. We should point out though that synthetic data is easy to generate with computer code because you can test it and therefore, the synthetic data now has more signal in it. Does it work? Does it not work? And you have all sorts of tests and that’s why as we’ll see, coding agents take off first. But the first way of trying to get past this data wall as we’re going to show is to use human-generated reasoning traces, which is when you get essentially a wide range of experts in different fields to try and elaborate on their problem-solving strategies to get to a solution for how to solve problems in specific domains, and that’s super expensive. As such: Model vendors will see their cost of goods sold for training data rise significantly. Depending on the posture of public policy, they may have to pay to license proprietary publisher data. Those deals are already starting as we saw with the recent Amazon/NYT deal. Whether this is the first of many or a high-water mark remains to be seen. More important, model vendors will have to source ever more sophisticated problem sets and “reasoning traces” from human experts in ever more fields. That’s what data vendors such as Scale.ai specialize in sourcing. Alex Wang of Scale AI says the next breakthroughs hinge on human-annotated chains of thought — not just more scraped text prose. Annotation at that depth is expensive and slow. It’s the next bottleneck. That type of data scarcity reshapes the economics of pretraining frontier models. And it’s why Meta reportedly shelled out ~$15 billion for a 50% stake in Scale.ai’s network of experts. [Listen to Alex Wang explain this phenomenon] A key point made by Wang is: “Data production will be the lifeblood of future AI systems” and he emphasized the human element – and this is why Meta paid $15 billion to acquire Alex. Some additional context to Alex Wang’s comments: Data production is very similar to spice production; it will be the lifeblood of future AI systems. The best-and-brightest people are one key source of that lifeblood, but proprietary data is just as critical. JPMorgan alone holds hundreds of petabytes of data, while GPT-4 trained on less than one petabyte. Enterprises and governments own orders of magnitude more proprietary data than has ever been fed into a frontier model, and that reservoir can power the next wave of truly elite systems. The open question is the role of synthetic data. The most plausible path is hybrid human-AI generation: AI handles the bulk creation, while domain experts — people with deep reasoning skills — inject high-fidelity corrections and insights. Hybrid human-AI data is the only way to achieve the extreme quality and nuance that future models will require. Meta’s reported $15 billion deal for Scale AI underscores this reality. The acquisition was less about tooling and more about access to Alex Wang, a small cadre of specialists, and Scale’s network of expert labelers across multiple domains. Human expert reasoning traces have emerged as the new bottleneck for frontier labs. In effect, these firms are calling for patriotic data contributions so everyone else can benefit, because without those human-validated traces, large language models will stall at their current ceiling. The funny part of Alex Wang’s comment was that he was basically calling on experts in every field to “contribute” their expertise for the benefit of mankind. Scale pays these experts for their time, but it’s still hourly wage labor. The tongue-in-cheek headline, “From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs,” was at the heart of Karl Marx’s economic philosophy. If you squint hard enough, that sounds an awful lot like what Alex Wang is proposing: Subject-matter experts contribute their knowledge for model training for the benefit of mankind. After the $15 billion acquihire, Alex Wang could be history’s richest communist. In the enterprise, there’s a very concrete use case that is already taking off and gives every indication of supporting frontier model training on its own. Why is coding is such a popular use case? And why are software engineering agents the first killer application in the enterprise? Let’s dig in. The face at the top on the graphic below is Anthropic PBC CEO Dario Amodei, whose Claude model powers Cursor the product — the software engineering agent. And Cursor is just the leading example of many software engineering agents. We’re still on the same intelligence-over-time curve, after the ChatGPT consumer bump, we see a new step-function labeled “Claude + Cursor SWE Agents.” The revenue table on the left — $1 million at launch, $100 million by month 12, $300 million by month 24, $500 million by month 30 — illustrates just how fast the uptake has been. What makes coding uniquely suited for early enterprise-agent success, and what hurdles remain before we can generalize this model to finance, supply-chain or customer-service domains where the feedback signals aren’t as clear? The answer is provided in the commentary below: Trial-and-error learning – reinforcement learning in formal terms – explains the breakout success of software-engineering agents. Unlike foundation models that consume 15 trillion tokens of data, a coding agent generates its own data. It proposes a solution, runs a test and immediately learns from pass-or-fail feedback. This loop supplies endless synthetic data and intrinsic reward signals, eliminating the need for vast proprietary datasets. Just as important, the workflow drops neatly into established developer tooling, so adoption requires no organizational surgery. These conditions made software engineering the natural beachhead for AI agents. Cursor is the iconic reference point, but dozens of similar tools are scaling fast, nearly all gravitating to Anthropic’s Claude frontier model as the preferred engine. Most products focus on writing net-new code or translating between languages; wholesale refactoring of legacy codebases is a harder problem and remains largely untapped. Success in software and math does not automatically port to other enterprise domains, where equivalent, high-fidelity feedback loops are harder to construct – a challenge we explore in subsequent slides. Let’s dig deeper into why SWE and math are such good examples. The chart below tracks accuracy on a basket of “intelligence” benchmarks – grade-school math, competitive math, software engineering task suite, multi-subject exams — over the past five years. Y-axis is benchmark accuracy; X-axis is calendar year. Everything meanders upward until sometime in 2024, then the red box shows a near-vertical surge. What changed? Post-training reinforcement learning on top of an already-strong base model. During the pretraining era – essentially up through mid-2024 – data efficiency was modest, reliant on scraping the vast but finite reservoirs of freely available Internet text. Once those wells began to run dry, progress hit diminishing returns. The inflection arrived in late 2024, when the post-training era took hold. Trial-and-error learning, i.e., reinforcement learning, allowed models to generate candidate outputs, verify them autonomously, and update weights based on right-or-wrong signals. Benchmarks in math and coding responded almost immediately, climbing at a near-vertical rate. The mechanism is straightforward: An agent checks its own work; if the test passes, the gradient reinforces that solution. If it fails, the model adjusts. That loop delivers dramatic gains without requiring trillions of new tokens. Both domains offer an immediate, unambiguous reward signal – code compiles or it doesn’t or it passes a unit test or it doesn’t; the math is either right or wrong – so the agent can as an objective verification tool, retry and learn. That tight loop means you don’t need another 10 trillion tokens of pretraining data; you just need a verifiable reward. But the catch is called out on the right of the graphic. The recipe doesn’t yet generalize to, say, legal reasoning or financial forecasting, where the ground truth is fuzzy, delayed or buried in human judgment. Generalizing the technique remains an open challenge. Two paths are emerging: The critical takeaway is once a domain provides an automated verifier, post-training efficiency explodes. The race is now to identify or construct verifiable environments beyond software and mathematics. There may be a new way of generating synthetic data that gets us past both the data bottleneck and the challenge of objectively verifiable rewards – something that appeared not long after Wang cashed his check. It has to do with trial-and-error learning (the fancy term is reinforcement learning) and models that can verify subjective, not objective, answers without humans in the loop. In other words, we may have a way of getting past human expert annotators detailing their reasoning to get to a correct answer. It appears GPT5, or an upgrade that comes soon after, will try to generate some combination of expert questions, answers, and the reasoning traces to get to the answers. Another model, acting like a teacher or verifier, will grade the right answers and the reasoning traces. This way the models might be able to get on a steep learning curve for more subjective answers just the way they’ve been learning math and coding. With verifiable rewards, SWE agents have been improving much faster than the general purpose underlying models. Once you inject reinforcement learning into a reliable reward signal, progress goes exponential. On the chart below, the Y-axis plots “task length” (think: wall-clock work a human would need). The gentle green slope (seven-month cadence) is overshadowed by the blue trend line on the right – halving the time horizon every 70 days. Left chart (METR data). Across general agent benchmarks the length of tasks an AI can complete without human hand-holding doubles roughly every seven months. GPT-2 could answer a trivia question; GPT-4o can spend ~15 minutes autonomously optimizing code for a custom chip. The slide isolates the core issue in agent self-improvement. For broad, loosely verified tasks the only boost comes from generic gains in the base model and occasional evaluation cycles – yielding a doubling of autonomous task-length roughly every seven months. In contrast, software-development agents operate with a hard reward signal: They either pass the unit test or they don’t. That verifiable feedback drives reinforcement learning that doubles task complexity every 70 days. The metric here is simple, how long the agent can run without human intervention. The sharper slope proves that hard, binary reward signals accelerate learning by an order of magnitude. That is the essential takeaway. Before crowning one model king, let’s look at the brutal economics of the models beneath the rise of agentic AI products. In the chart below, the Y-axis is the composite benchmark score; each colored step represents a new model release. The dark line highlights OpenAI’s leading model, which itself changes (with each square dot), and the quick catch-up by rivals (the other colored lines). The staircase chart plots an independent “AI-intelligence index” for frontier models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, DeepSeek, Alibaba, and others over the past 24 months. What stands out is how small both dimensions have become. GPT-4o takes the lead but within weeks DeepSeek R1 or Gemini 3 closes the gap. Switching costs between APIs are measured in a few lines of Python code, so the CAP shortens with every release. In other words, you can spend a billion dollars on compute and data only to enjoy a six-week pricing umbrella before the market reduces your advantage to zero. The point is, spending $10 billion and multiple years on a frontier training run no longer guarantees a lasting edge. The moment a new model lands, the competitive lead can evaporate almost as quickly as a new consumer gadget cycle. Unlike the pharmaceutical industry – where patent protection secures a decade of exclusivity – model training enjoys no comparable moat. The current race revolves around ever‐larger compute clusters and incremental algorithmic tweaks. Hardware scale is available to any firm with sufficient capital; algorithmic insights diffuse quickly through open research and employee mobility. Proprietary training data helps, but it is only one ingredient and rarely decisive. To achieve both a substantial competitive-advantage gap and a durable competitive-advantage period, the game must shift. The next era will require an entirely different data foundation, one capable of conferring a sustained, defensible edge. That foundation is the enterprise digital twin discussed in the sections that follow. To tease the last section, Jamie Dimon and any other enterprise that can model their data into a digital twin of operations, can train proprietary agents that have a very high CAG and a durable CAP. All the capex may be going into a half-dozen or more frontier labs, but the sustainable differentiation will lie in these enterprises. Let’s now explore how this dynamic shows up in pricing models for the underlying frontier models. The chart below lays this out. Here’s the killer behind those shrinking advantage windows: token prices are in free-fall. Y-axis is log-scale price per million tokens (from $100 down to sub-penny). X-axis spans October 2021 to April 2025. Each diagonal line shows successive model releases driving price down an order of magnitude every few months. So USD per million tokens against release dates. Every colored trend-line is a different capability tier -GPT-3.5-class (teal), GPT-4-class (pink), GPT-4o-plus (blue). Regardless of tier, prices are declining on an exponential glide-path: In other words, you can burn $10 billion on GPT-6 training and watch the market re-price that output at a fraction of the margin in a single quarter. Throw in minimal switching costs for customers of the API and you get the picture. The point is that packaged agents — bundled with proprietary data and workflow context — are where we think the durable economics will live. The accelerating collapse in API pricing stands apart from the economics of products built on top. Venture capital is pouring into frontier labs at an unprecedented rate. Nation-state funds are underwriting domestic model efforts, Chinese labs are proliferating and high-profile entrants – Elon Musk among them – are scrambling to join the race. The parallel to the late-’90s internet bubble is hard to ignore – tens of billions chasing what increasingly looks like a mirage. Today the consumer-agent crown already sits with the incumbent leader, and the leading API position belongs to Anthropic. Durable differentiation will not come from another round of capital-intensive model training; it will come from doing something genuinely different. That necessity ushers in the next era, where the advantage shifts to differentiated data foundations and domain-specific agent platforms. Let’s come back to our three eras of AI. We’ve come full circle: Consumer chatbots got us started, coding agents proved to be a flywheel, but enterprise agents are where the real money — and long-term moat — will be built in our view. Think of the trajectory in three discrete eras, mapped on the curve you’ve seen all episode: The core takeaway is AI is programmed by data, and true durable differentiation will come from proprietary data. Consider JPMorgan Chase as a stand-in for any advanced enterprise. Initial estimates pegged its private corpus at roughly 150 petabytes – already hundreds of times the half-petabyte to 1-petabyte used to train a GPT-4-class model. More recent figures suggest the bank may hold on the order of an exabyte. Yet volume alone isn’t the story; it’s how that data is modeled to represent day-to-day operations. Enterprise data is dense, high-signal and – if properly organized – far richer than the broad, low-signal crawl that feeds frontier models. Unlocking that value demands several shifts: These elements will trigger new go-to-market motions, a fresh generation of application-platform vendors, revamped technical stacks, and — ultimately — organizational and business-model change for the enterprises that adopt them. Let’s dig into what enterprise AGI will actually look like. Below is a classic diagram many use to describe the elements of agentic AI – but key pieces are missing to power the enterprise in our view. Most agent diagrams look identical – tools on the left – calendar, calculator, code interpreter, search; cognitive modules on the right – planning, reflection, self-critique, chain-of-thought, sub-goal decomposition; a memory stack across the top; and an action port along the bottom. The entire picture is algorithm-centric because that is what computer-science researchers reward. Data hardly shows up, yet in the enterprise data is everything. This particular diagram – borrowed from a recent Stanford Computer Science lecture – omits the component that actually creates value – the environment or world model. An agent learns only by interacting with its environment and receiving feedback on the outcome. In academic settings that omission is an afterthought; in a business context it is the difference between a toy and a system that can move revenue, cost, or risk. The absence of a first-class data layer in mainstream agent thinking underscores why enterprise agents remain an under-explored frontier. The disruption is staring the industry in the face, but few acknowledge it because the conversation is dominated by algorithmic heroes rather than data realism. Let’s pull some examples from real-world models where agents got started. Before we take too many liberties with the phrase enterprise digital twin, it helps to remember the very first twins that ever mattered to AI researchers were seen in gaming. DeepMind’s AlphaStar learned to dominate StarCraft II not just because its model architecture was magic , but because the entire game environment – the 4-D map of units, resources, timing and fog-of-war – was exposed as a perfect, real-time, real-world model. On the graph below we show the match-making-rating or MMR percentile on the X-axis, skill level on the Y-axis. The blue curve is human progression from silver to grandmaster; the red dot is AlphaStar smashing through the top percentile – discovering strategies no human had ever tried, courtesy of reinforcement learning a digital twin. The crucial insight is the mapping of people, places, things and activities inside a game world to the same four dimensions — people, places, things and processes—inside a business. Conventional data platforms provide static snapshots, a kaleidoscope view. Agents require a richer, dynamic representation that captures how actions ripple across the enterprise. When an agent modifies a step in a process it needs the map to trace the impact on downstream people and workflows. Reinforcement learning flourished first inside environments that already contained such world models. DeepMind’s AlphaStar for StarCraft and OpenAI’s work on the Dota strategy game are canonical examples. Each environment supplied continuous, verifiable rewards – intermediate signals that tested strategic choices and an ultimate win-or-lose outcome. These conditions allowed agents to iterate rapidly and improve. The same principles apply to the enterprise. By constructing a four-dimensional digital twin – people, places, things, processes – businesses can deliver the feedback loops agents need to learn, adapt and ultimately drive measurable results across complex operations. Lessons from AlphaStar and Dota form the blueprint for this more advanced, enterprise-grade implementation. If an agent can exploit a synthetic world model to beat 99% of pro gamers, imagine what it can do when the “map” is a digital twin of a bank or a live model of a supply-chain. But that also means enterprises – not vendors – must own and curate the world model so the agent can learn with verifiable rewards. The point is that the lessons from AlphaStar will translate to finance, healthcare and manufacturing, anything with a digital twin. Minecraft serves as the next reference world model. In the Voyager project the environment is more open-ended than StarCraft. An agent starts by learning how to craft simple stone tools, then uses those tools to build basic structures. As competence grows it discovers how to forge more advanced implements, each new capability unlocking a broader range of tasks. Over time the agent accumulates skills and expands the set of tools at its disposal. That progressive, self-directed skill acquisition is critical because every new ability enriches the environment and, in turn, furnishes richer feedback for further learning. The pattern – learn a tool, use it to create value, learn the next tool – provides an important template for constructing an enterprise world model where agents continuously extend their own action space. Now let’s really try to double down on the importance of data. Every headline about AI credits the algorithm – AlexNet, Transformers, RLHF, the new reasoning stacks – but the right side of this slide reminds us that each breakthrough was really sparked by a new dataset era. A recent blog post by Jack Morrison, highlighted on the Latent Space podcast, underscores a recurring blind spot: Everyone fixates on algorithmic breakthroughs while ignoring the dataset hiding in plain sight. Morrison sketches the reasoning era and notes that agents will learn from verifiers — calculators for math, compilers and unit tests for code — yet leaves the critical dataset box essentially blank. The dataset is obvious. Every organization is building, or will build, a platform that captures an ever-larger digital twin of its operations. That twin — people, places, things, processes — is the immense, high-fidelity corpus that will power enterprise-grade reasoning. Let’s now connect enterprise agents with digital twins as we’re defining them. We’ve moved up the curve from consumer chat to coding / SWE agents – and the slide below shows how it all works inside a company. The chart from Palantir highlights at the bottom right an end-to end supply-chain twin; red call-outs on the left highlight RL feedback arrows feeding the agent box. The metric tree illustrates how “What happened?” rolls up to “What should we do?” Think of three layers working in concert: Installing a digital twin – like the Palantir schematic shown here – is only the first step. The engine that turns that representation into agent learning is the metric tree. Unlike conventional business intelligence dashboards, where key performance indicators live in isolated tables or hand-coded formulas, a metric tree links every measure in a learned, hierarchical graph. Change a node – say, authorizing a product return – and the tree reveals ripples across customer-support satisfaction, on-hand inventory and cash-flow metrics. The richer the twin, the higher the fidelity of those relationships. The agent sits above this structure and dynamically selects tools that correspond to analytical intent: If the tree lacks a metric, the agent adds one – mirroring how Voyager in “Minecraft” learned new tools and skills, then fed them back into the environment. Each new metric becomes a tool; each successful action becomes a skill; both flow into the twin, iteratively expanding its scope. The result is a self-reinforcing feedback loop: Agent actions enrich the symbolic model, and the enriched model, in turn, sharpens agent decisions. The twin need not be perfect on day one; it grows in lock-step with agent capability. Let’s look at how this will affect enterprise architecture. This graphic below builds on our previous work and pulls it all together. It also answers the question: Who is actually building a live, digital representation of the business? The graphic reprises the layered stack often used in Breaking Analysis and Services-as-Software. This pattern echoes the history of information technology: Each new abstraction layer envelops the one below. Lower layers keep innovating, but lose feature-based differentiation and pricing power once the upper layer decides which capabilities to expose. Traditional data platforms captured snapshots of strings; metric-centric platforms upgraded those to snapshots of things. The green layer goes further – capturing processes – bridging sixty years of application and data islands. A quick tour of the contenders: Margin and control will accrue to the layer that captures processes and feeds agents; data infrastructure, while indispensable, becomes the cost-optimized foundation beneath it. Let’s focus now on how enterprise software is splitting into two worlds. Picture the frozen-lake scene from the recent Bond film: Rami Malek’s villain stands unharmed on the glossy surface while a diver flails in the frigid water below. The metaphor captures how enterprise software is cleaving into two distinct worlds. The industry is aligning accordingly: players above the ice focus on modeled business context and higher-margin economics, while those below face mounting pressure to commoditize. The strategic choice is to move up into outcome-driven layers or prepare for tightening margins in the infrastructure trench. The discussion comes back to a single conclusion: Ownership of coherent, high-signal enterprise data is the deciding factor in the next wave of AI value capture. Labs may still dominate headline model releases, yet those models increasingly rely on proprietary ground-truth data that only large organizations possess in scale. On the visual above, Sam Altman anchors the left – world-famous foundation models. Amodei sits center-left, demonstrating that post-training on domain feedback can spin meaningful ARR. Center-right stands the prize everyone is pursuing. In our view, a live, verifiable digital twin of an enterprise is represented at the far right by Dimon, steward of the deepest transaction ledger in banking, perfectly positioned to weaponize that twin and challenge model labs on both margin and moat.

Title: Amazon Stock Falls 8%. Why, Jassy To-Dos, Why To Skip $AMZN Shares

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Amazon's stock dropped 8.3% as AWS's growth significantly lagged rivals like Azure and Google Cloud, disappointing investors despite strong retail sales.AWS's slower growth stems from its lack of integrated proprietary AI models and a strategy requiring high technical expertise, hindering adoption in the generative AI age.Analysts express skepticism regarding Amazon's ability to compete effectively in AI, citing CEO Jassy's unconvincing explanations and AWS's strategic shortcomings. Amazon stock fell 8.3% in after-hours trading on Thursday following a mixed second quarter report, according to CNBC. Why? Although Amazon’s retail business performed well, investors expressed disappointment with the growth pace of Amazon Web Services – which grew more slowly than Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Analysts were left wanting more from CEO Andy Jassy’s explanations during the conference call for AWS’s relatively slow growth. Amazon’s fundamental problem is its failure to adapt to the competitive imperatives of the generative AI age, noted my book Brain Rush. This age has been propelled by two companies – OpenAI which supplied the fast-growing ChatGPT and Nvidia, the designer of AI chips for speeding the training and operation of AI chatbots. Amazon seems to be applying the strategy it used to pioneer the cloud services industry to the AI cloud market – where it is struggling to catch up. More specifically, unlike Microsoft and Google – which have access to proprietary integrated AI chatbots (ChatGPT and Gemini, respectively) – AWS’s strategy of handing off to developers the task of choosing and integrating individual computing services requires more technical expertise – thereby slowing adoption. To grow faster, Jassey ought to consider three possible strategies: Since Jassy helped build AWS and has yet to demonstrate a compelling vision for competing with faster growing rivals, I am skeptical of whether Amazon will be able to leapfrog these rivals. “Our conviction that AI will change every customer experience is starting to play out," Jassy said in an earnings release. “Our AI progress across the board continues to improve our customer experiences, speed of innovation, operational efficiency, and business growth, and I’m excited for what lies ahead,” he added. I have requested comment from Amazon and will update this post if I receive a response. Amazon’s second quarter results blended above expectations sales and earnings with a mixed forecast for the future and a shaky explanation for why AWS is growing more slowly in the age of AI. Here are the key numbers: Amazon and its hyperscaler rivals – such as Google and Meta – are increasing their capital expenditures. For example, Amazon is boosting capital expenditures 42% to $118 billion in 2025, Google’s will reach $85 billion and Meta forecast $69 billion in 2025 capex, according to CNBC. Investors are using growth rates as a proxy for the return on AI investments. Since AWS is growing at roughly half the rate of Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, investors see a problem with AWS’s strategy. Jassy’s responses to analyst questions about AWS’ relatively slow growth did not directly address the question. He said the faster-growing second ranked rival was “65%” the size of AWS, highlighted Microsoft’s security woes – notably the hacking of SharePoint, and suggested it was “early days” in AI, according to the Q2 earnings conference call transcript. These comments did not offer a compelling explanation of why Amazon – with 30% market share to Microsoft Azure’s 20%, according to Synergy Group -- is growing about half the rate of challengers. Since Jassy sidestepped the question, here are two reasons I think AWS is growing more slowly than rivals: Here are three strategies Amazon must pursue to grow faster than its cloud services rivals: These recommendations may be difficult to implement and may not result in new services that deliver more value to customers than those from faster-growing rivals. That’s partly because they are at odds with Amazon’s culture. For example, Amazon believes in inventing and improving its own solutions – as it did with AWS and Alexa. Therefore the recommended partnerships may be at odds with the company’s culture. Moreover, as former CEO of AWS, Jassy may have strategic blind spots. These could include viewing AI as primarily an infrastructure challenge that Amazon can solve with superior engineering. Jassy may also be dismissing the more rapid growth of rivals as superficial, as he did during the investor conference call, rather than a sign customers value AI cloud services from Microsoft and Google more highly. Is Amazon stock – which has lost 2.4% of its value so far in 2025 – trading at a bargain price? Some analysts sound skeptical: Despite this skepticism, analysts see Amazon stock as slightly undervalued. Of the 52 analysts who cover Amazon, the stock has 9.2% upside based on an average price target of $255.72, according to Zacks. Unless AWS’ revenue growth and operating profit accelerate, that modest gain could prove difficult to achieve.

She knows too much and can name far too many powerful names. This whole performance right now is her showing that so long as she gets a pardon, she can be counted on to protect them. Any congressional testimony that she would give would be well rehearsed and by bipartisan agreement, there would be no real questions asked of her that had not been agreed upon. I don’t think that Trump will give her a pardon anytime soon as that would blow up support from most of his base but he could do so as he leaves the Presidency when any odium would all be on him but who could care less. Supposedly they moved her to a minimum security prison in Texas. More comfortable, better food, full dental. Gee, I wonder what the consideration was for that? It’s also the current home of fraudster Elizabeth Holmes. I would think that the kind of upper-middle class perps there would shun the likes of Maxwell. She should be careful of what she wishes for. For Ghislaine, there is a barrister showing photographs Of every head she’s had the pleasure to know And all the young girls that come and go Stop and say hello On the corner is nobility with a motorcar And everybody laughs at Andy behind his back And the billionaire never wears a rubber in the pouring rain Very strange Ghislaine is in my ears and in my eyes Vet beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back in Ghislaine, there is a minimum security prison in Texas And in her pocket is a pardon from his esteemed She likes to keep her record clean It’s a clean machine Ghislaine, is in my ears and in my eyes A tour d’farce and insidious lies In summer, meanwhile back Behind the shelter in the middle of a cell block A jailbird is about to go astray And though she feels as if she’s in a play She is anyway Ghislaine is in my ears and in my eyes Vet beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back Ghislaine is in my ears and in my eyes Vet beneath the blue suburban skies Ghislaine Penny Lane, by the Beatles https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7syIxQCquo&list=RDz7syIxQCquo I know this is cynical, but the women’s life expectancy has to be pretty short, whether she’s in prison or not. I think its a simple a matter of “the women who knows too much”. The fact that she is still alive suggests everyone assumes she has some kind of dead-man switch for release of incriminating information. Always wondered why Epstein didn’t. Though if he were actually still alive somewhere… Just speculating Her daddy didn’t. Arrogance? Yes but he got a prime burial plot on the Mount of Olives. Maybe that was his final deal as he jumped off his luxury yacht instead of being pushed by a mossad agent. I doubt that Maxwell has all that much in the way of salacious information to bargain with, but it should be enough to get housed (against all FBP rules) in a minimum security “camp” until her sentence is commuted for “good behavior.” The pardon won’t come until Trump’s headed out the door. Maxwell and Epstein were pimps, not pedophiles (a sexual interest in pre-pubescent children). They pandered to the tastes of wealthy, powerful, and often married, men for youthful “models” to cavort with in the present and to breed with after the collapse (the really creepy part). It was easy to groom these “models” for the sex trade when they were 15-17 years of age — one of the oldest stories in the book. Like any good pimp Epstein got first dibs. Offensively exploitative but hardly shocking. Listening to Michael Wolff, the real dirt is that Epstein and Maxwell have evidence that Trump was laundering money for Russian oligarchs off-shoring their cash when the Putin government started clawing back their ill-gotten gains from the ‘90’s. Epstein told Wolff that Trump ratted him out to the FBI in 2008 in retaliation for Epstein’s threats to expose the financial shell-game behind the sale of the Maison de l’Amité in Palm Beach to art-collector and AC Monaco football-owner Dmitry Rybolovlev, after Trump froze him out of the deal. Epstein told Wolff that he was convinced (and probably had the dirt) that Trump had conspired with Rybolovlev to falsely inflate the value of the property through secret loans and a sham re-sale, evading money laundering rules and capital gains taxes — a pretty serious crime. I don’t see how you can assert that Epstein and Maxwell were not pedophiles and minimize their sex trafficking. The Federal law that criminalizes traveling abroad for the sole purpose of having sex puts the age of consent at 18 (even though the law seems to be broader, I infer that in practice it is prosecuted only when the trip can be reasonably demonstrated to be for sex only) . It’s called “child sex tourism”: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention/crimes-against-minors.html It’s been widely reported that some of the Lolita Express trips were to haul back underage women and that Epstein partook of his wares. There are also reports of Epstein and Maxwell having menage a trois with underage girls. Under most legal definitions “pedophilia” is defined as the unnatural sexual interest in pre-pubescent children — generally defined as below the age of 14. It is only since the 1970’s that “the age of consent” was raised above 15 in most U.S. states and is still as young as 13 in a shocking number of states. Child marriage is actually still legal in most states. There is a second legal category of “underage” persons who are subject to “statutory rape” laws, but most of these violations are not felonious. This is why Epstein and Maxwell were prosecuted for Sex Trafficking rather than Child Molestation. While these two creeps groomed a few children, their sexual exploitation was of young people under the age of majority but over the age of consent. This is why still I maintain (as I have for years) that Trump’s real Epstein problem is money laundering and tax evasion. Los Angeles city workers and police officers began clearing out a major homeless encampment near the 405 Freeway on July 31, removing trash, tents and an estimated 50–75 unhoused residents from a patch of Van Nuys sidewalk that had become known as “Tent City” or “The Compound.” “This is a notorious encampment,” Mayor Karen Bass told reporters at the scene. “This is such a dangerous location. I saw propane canisters all over the place. This is dangerous.” ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Stridently never mentioned in the midst and aftermath of the well spread out January LA Infernos was the idea that the 72,308 or so homeless living in the City of Angles have outdoor fires all the time and not just propane ones. Careless people shouldn’t be playing with matches, but there you have it. Those tiny propane canisters which cannot be refilled, and should not be placed in regular garbage bins? Safer to sit around than be mishandled. Wake me when Coleman provides a responsible way for people to turn these in. You’re supposed to puncture butane cartridges before recyling them. Not sure about propane. But I’d expect they’re used until completely empty. I heard something about California banning the non-refillable ones but idk the status of that. The refillable ones cost more but pay for themselves after two or so refills. You can refill the non-refillable ones too, people do that all the time, I don’t think it’s even illegal per se, you’re just not allowed to transport them in a car after refilling. “China just bet $2 billion on fusion energy. The US must respond.” Sooo, is this The Hill saying that there is now a fusion energy gap? And the US must respond with $20 billion or however much it takes to beat those damn Chinese? Man, I have been hearing about fusion energy coming to solve all our energy problems since the 80s and scientists & engineers have spent their entire carers trying to make it come true. God knows how much has been spent on this dream all this time but I am willing to bet that it is far more than the $2 billion that the Chinese are talking about here. Seriously, $2 billion isn’t ‘a major new national bet’ by the Chinese. It’s a down payment to see if there is any promise here. But as the writer of this article is the CEO of Commonwealth Fusion Systems, I can guess why he says all this- https://cfs.energy/ What I understood from the original article this one referred to, Chinese are expecting commercial fusion energy around 2040, but are now starting companies that produce the tech needed to get there. So that when other nations join in, they’ll buy Chinese tech rather than waste time trying to develop their own. A bit like getting rich during a cold rush by selling the food and equipment the hopeful will need in their quest. We used to joke that if you ask an American fusion researcher when fusion power will be available, they will always answer “1 year after I retire.” It’s just the author of the article, the CEO of a USian fusion venture, talking his book. All my life it’s been 30 years away. I doubt it’s gotten any closer. Pastor: God made me do it– Back in the good old days, it was the devil made me do it. Its kismet really, pastor uses divine intervention in attempt to complete the invisible wholly trinity. Well “What you see is what you get.” God, I miss comedians like him as they were hilarious. Was just reading his Wikipedia entry and of course George Carlin was one of the show’s writers- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_Wilson But I did note this sentence- ‘Wilson was the first African American to host a successful TV variety show’ Are there many still doing so on American variety shows? I’ve seen some here on Oz TV like Letterman, Colbert & Fallon but when you think about it, they are all tall glasses of milk. ‘Wilson was the first African American to host a successful TV variety show’ Nat King Cole had a show in 1956- 57 http://www.classictvinfo.com/TheNatKingColeShow/ Geraldine! / ;) I loved Flip Wilson’s skits when I was a kid. And in his Geraldine performance on Ed Sullivan, he’s wearing a fantastic suit. Re ‘Artificial stupidity’ made AI trading bots spontaneously form cartels when left unsupervised, Wharton study reveals If I understood this article correctly, the headline is misleading. The bots demonstrated herd behaviour (rather than forming cartels) not because they were communicating with one another (which I take to be a requirement in order to fit the definition of “collusion”) but because they were all trained the same way and ended up receiving the same market outcome information simultaneously, thus leading to identical behaviour. Did I miss something? You got it. They’re just like our own ruling classes. Isn’t the goal of AI to mimic humans? Unfortunately it seems that, for some areas of knowledge, most of the AI training material comes from ignorant loudmouths who don’t think… Menschliches, allzu menschliches. Back when I was doing long range risk analysis, we found it depressingly easy to develop artificial stupidity simulations which consistently replicated both self-serving recommendations by predatory consultants and the corporations who loved them, and disastrous decisions by the clueless policymakers who followed their advice. The models accurately predicted actual long term outcomes pretty much every time. Leavitt to Believer In this week’s episode Lumpy Rutherford thinks it’s funny when Believer Cleavers are grounded after Karoline tricks them into a sense of false security by actually being honest in one utterance. Hilarity ensues. She’s officially now the teacher’s pet-the app(aratchick) of his eye. “At 17, Hannah Cairo Solved a Major Math Mystery” Just goes to show you that mathematics does not care who you are. It does not care about your colour, your background, your class, your religion, your sex, your age or anything like that. It only cares if you can understand it and I give kudos to this young girl and hope we hear more of her. But then there was this bit- ‘Cairo applied to 10 graduate programs. Six rejected her because she didn’t have a college degree. Two admitted her, but then higher-ups in those universities’ administrations overrode those decisions. Only the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University were willing to welcome her straight into a doctoral program.’ After this groundbreaking paper which is making mathematicians around the world sit up, 80% of the colleges that she applied to knocked her back because – wait for it – she didn’t have the “accreditation” on her resume. Jesus wept. I think the same was true with Einstein at one of the institutions, although I can’t remember the particulars now… Yep. All the people in my field generally published their earth changing papers due to discussion and feedback from people when they got recruited on criteria that definitely weren’t “were you Oxbridge/Ivy League?” Accreditation didn’t do it. Raw talent did. The “longtime God of math psych who I worked with” rejected Oxbridge, went to Brum, and simply worked on topics that were interesting. He’d got so senior that nobody could tell him “you can’t do that”. He got his 2nd wind after “retirement” when kept on as emeritus professor….. told me he felt like a post doc doing WTF he wanted with no stupid admin. I used to give him a lift to/from office in my car. Good times chewing the fat. Him also telling me LOADS of gossip about people the MSM fawn over. I always thought the peer review (and P&T process) makes that essentially impossible for youngish people to go off the beaten path, especially in disciplines that have identity issues (most soc sci fit.) What do I mean? Well, I can say a fair bit about how poli sci has been evolving last few decades: if you listen to the details in the debates over some big topics, parties, ideology, institutions, rule of law, etc, you start realizing that those are some peculiar definitions. Then you look at the methodologies and realize that the definitions are largely driven by the need to measure things and sic statistical methods on them. This, to me, is fine, up to a point–all of stats, or, indeed sciences generally, suffer from the problem. Assumptions are often stupid and are driven by a need to make things simple enough to handle. So errors are homoskedastic, friction does not exist, and so on…and everyone knows that these are not true. In soc sci, this awareness is not very strong: the stupid assumptions wind up driving the argunents and debates and stuff like “rationality” wind up being too central to the debate. Even the people who are aware of the problems wind up peddling stupid “fixes” (my advisor literally called them “epicycles.”) From the science side of the ledger, epicycles are dangerous because a model with a lot of epicycles can account for pretty much everything by definition. One can raise degrees of freedom questions, but, at least in practice, how the tradeoff between parsimony and alleged explanatory power works is not clear–especially since we know the social universe is more complicated than the natural, let alone the physical. In some sense, the trend towards “science,” at least in certain social sciences, seems to have instead brought scientism that tended to strengthen the dogmas that people have to adhere to if they want to go anywhere. Math and physics are, among others, somewhat freer fron this because they have stricter and clearer standards for what counts as useful insights. Even then, we still have many people who are very good at computation who can’t get there, well, because real insights are hard. Agreed. I have seen it said that a problem with first year econ is that to make it viable you Must use these simplifications….. but are told “we’ll relax these later”. But there *IS* no later for 99%. So 99% learn garbage. In reality they really would have done better learning the tips I learnt later. These are closer to “real” hard sciences or mathematics (with identity relationships). If they’d done so they’d immediately spot why 1st year econ is a crock and by rights should be in the faculty of theology in most cases. PS I was actually threatened in person by a senior person in health economics when a clever editor clocked his attempt to sabotage my paper in peer review (I co-authored with the God of math psych so the paper was rock solid). The threat was cunningly worded so as to give plausible deniability as to physical/reputation damage but I NEVER forgot. I got to ask some discreet questions about the guy later in my career, and yes, he was untouchable with it strongly implied he had links to EU decision makers. Yep, all made sense…..but all this must remain ALLEGED. It began a process whereby I voted LEAVE. No I never ever believed the leave campaign promises….. no I never believed we’d do better. It was a Samson move. Bring your house down too. I don’t appreciate threats sanctioned by the EU. Yikes. I have some bad experiences in peer reviews that got too “personal” myself (truly “blind” peer reviews don’t really happen, methinks), but that seems particularly awful. I was going to follow up with a curious experience I had talking to a quasi-colleague (I guess) who teaches something that’s a lot more humanities than anything quasi science who experimented lately with having an AI write and grade papers, and his experience was that AI was very good at both writing and identifying low A/A- papers, but terrible at identifying very good ones. I pointed out that this makes perfect sense given AI typically operates: it creates a “rule/formula/rubric” for what a “correct” paper should look like and docks points off for deviations from it. So it will produce solid papers that covers all grounds and does everything mechanically “correctly,” but it will have problems deviating from the rules. The way my colleague thinks, the really good papers deviates from the “norm” in some “brilliant” fashion, although what eactly that “brilliance” means is not clear a priori (although, who knows, if AI sees enough data and if there are common threads across many professors teaching the topic, maybe it can figure the “rule” out). So, as far as AI is conerned, at least with the data it got, high A papers and varying degrees of B papers are indistinguishable, since they all deviated to some significant degree from the “norm.” I did suggest to him that it would be interesting to see if the AI can generate, using the same procedure, a range of B papers, and I’m eager to see what comes out of this exerise. But this, of course, is not just “AI” thing. Bureaucracy works this way, and, in a way, so does the “standardization” process in academic life. There are “rules” of what works in the fashionable argument given the current trends (and in poli sci, the trends are heavily methodlogy driven–we don’t have a soul, so we try to mimic the “good” methodology in other disciplines and shoehorn them into our debates. Sometimes, these are very insightful. Other times, they involve some creative assumptions that should force you to think. Both are true more often than not, though.), but the interest is more on the “results,” assuming that the universe follows the “rules,” though, than what takes place under the hood. In an odd way, very AI-like process. AI is the final triumph of process over judgment. Every bureaucrat’s dream. Fortunately it is a stochastic and self-consuming process and contains the seeds of its own downfall, like the scene in Brazil where the hero connects the bureaucratic input to the output with no human in the loop. More literally than not, I think. I firmly believe in the implication of Arrow’s theorem: that every formulaic process can be gamed to engineer certain set of outcomes while strictly sraying within the rules–thus leading to internal contradictions. For the “bureaucracy” to retain influence, it needs some kind of randomization in how it operates. (This, in turn, begs the question–can computers randomize? Can people ranodomize, even? My understanding–and I’m out of date by a few decades–is that most humans can’t randomize very well, except very good mathematicians and ypung children (odd factoid given the Quanta link.) can computers randomize? I gather that generating truly random numbers is in fact not so easy. Most machines, languages, OSes have some kind of random() function, but generally it is a pseudo-random number generator that starts from a seed value (thus the seed values you see as inputs to generative AI apps), ergo the ‘random’ numbers tend to follow a sequence and are deterministic, i.e., same seed value, same sequence. So there are hacks tricks like using the millisecond counter as the seed value. This is considered “good enough” for most applications. Apparently, Cloudflare uses a wall of 100 lava lamps with a camera pointed at them, to generate random values for secure encryption keys (they copped this idea from Silicon Graphics). Pseudo-randomisation by computers is CRUCIAL in reproducing and checking (for instance) the Fortran written simulations I ran in my PhD. The seeds were all documented. So results were reproducible and checkable. Sadly, I think the seeds of destruction are rooted in every bureaucracy, every process, and it usually comes down to gaming of the system. It’s something I’ve always struggled with when it comes to imagining what an ‘ideal’ governmental or administrative system would look like. I wonder whether there is a deep relationship with Gögel’s theorem (that in every formal system strong enough to be of general application, undecidable propositions can be formulated)? I have always viewed Gödel’s theorem as a refutation of the logical positivists in humanities such as law, that it is not possible to have a universal rule-based legal reasoning because at some point you have to step outside logic to choose between mutually contradictory positions (but it would be possible for limited toy “expert systems”). This is also an argument against AI in legal reasoning. Fundamentally, you can pretend to derive everything from your axioms and logic but if you claim universality of application then at some point you will run into a contradiction that requires you to invent or amend an axiom to resolve and that step does not admit process/logic, only belief/intuition/judgment. This applies to other fields as well, e.g. religion. Arrow’s theorem mirrors this. The bureaucratic process (axioms plus logic) will hit the buffers. The aspect of chance you refer to would give it a way to surmount this constraint and decide the otherwise undecideable but, of course, the system ceases to be deterministic. And that aspect of chance was what physics had to accept in quantum mechanics (in most formulations of its meaning)…. Perhaps the social sciences have yet to have their quantum revolution…? @Revenant Perhaps the social sciences have yet to have their quantum revolution…? I’ve often wondered exactly this. The “inspiration” for their endeavors have the distinct flavor of classical mechanics. But…this is also in reaction to those who thought they were channeling QM–the postmodernists, most of whom just got themselves confused… Ivan Illich used to quip that there was something strange with conflating diplomas with knowledge. I often think about that. Clearly she’s in no need of going through the hassle of getting all the papers, as she has proven she is the equal (or perhaps the superior!) of many mathematicians with full diplomas. If she has decided she has no need for all the university years, who in the world could possibly refute her? I can just about guarantee that all of the mathematics departments she applied to would have wanted to take her. We’re explicitly told that two of them were overruled. I suspect some of the others were pre-screened and didn’t even see the application. I think if there had been one she had her heart set on, a personal contact from her advisor followed by a call or even a visit would have been the way to go: get her on the faculty radar, so they can go to bat for her. If she already did that then it means credentialism is further advanced than I thought. Great story, in any case. Mathematics, perhaps more than any other discipline, has always welcomed amateurs. You don’t need expensive lab equipment or a department – if you’ve got the books, the brain, and the patience, you can make a contribution. Galois invented his theory of groups, that later became famous, at a similar age (she even looks a little like his portrait). Hopefully she fares better than he did – he died in a duel at age 20. After this groundbreaking paper which is making mathematicians around the world sit up, 80% of the colleges that she applied to knocked her back because – wait for it – she didn’t have the “accreditation” on her resume. Jesus wept. I took it to mean they wanted her to enroll in an undergraduate program. It’s perfectly ok to do graduate level mathematics coursework and research while enrolled as an undergrad, and lots of above-average (I won’t even say exceptional) undergrads do exactly that. The thing is, as an undergrad, you also have to do some studies outside your major, e.g. in science, humanities, history, etc. I can understand the view that everyone should get some exposure to those subjects instead of being laser-focused on math from day 1. I actually knew an 18 year old graduate student in computer science at my school, but he had completed an undergrad program before arriving. IIRC he went to high school for 1 year, then entered university at age 15 and graduated in 3 years, before entering grad school. That seemed to me like a perfectly good approach. He was also a very good classical pianist for what that’s worth. I myself wanted to take a certain math class at my school, that was listed in the catalog as being in room X of building Y. I found my way there on the first day, but got to the room a few minutes late, and it took another 15 minutes or so to realize I wasn’t in a math class. The room had somehow gotten switched to being used for a literature class. But the lecture was interesting enough that I signed up for the literature class and it was great. Elite mathematics ability seems to decay even faster than in some elite sports. Our Andrew Dittmer (Harvard PhD in pure math, where Harvard and Princeton have the two top programs) said that he believed he had harmed his mathematical ability by taking such an interest in social science and spending a lot of time on it. Social sciences do harm mathematical skills, but not always for “bad” reasons. Social phenomena do not work in a manner consistent with math. Making sense of them requires that you give up a lot of math in how you think. However, I’ve seen many examples where trying to mix soc sci and math leads to stuff that’s both bad soc sci and bad math–in fact, far more often than “good” outcomes one way or the other…or very rarely, both. Trump climate report– I heard several Jimmy Dore videos showed up in the footnotes, including the one about the Earth getting colder and the classic where the guy explains that Doppler radar is being used to guide hurricanes. Very scientific stuff. /parody The Big Smoke to the west of us is pretty handy as it has all the usual stores and whatnot, pretty convenient for shopping… When I mention Godzone, in theory its all of California’s red state bastion from Bakersfield to Redding, but really zeroes in on dogma central in Visalia, which for a population base of 146,000 sports a good many 3,000 to 4,000 seat megachurches, largely full of MAGA supporters, but even the good old Catholic church got in the game and built the largest parish church in the country (seats 3,200) in little Visalia. The idea that Visalia is the least educated and most dogma indoctrinated city in the country is kinda interesting… ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ VISALIA, Calif. (KSEE/KGPE) – Visalia placed first in WalletHub’s ranking of the “Most and Least Educated Cities in America” – as the number one least educated city. The June 30th ranking compared the 150 largest metropolitan areas across 11 categories, including the share of adults 25 and older with a bachelor’s degree or higher and the quality of public-school systems. The metrics found Visalia to be the least educated city, followed by the areas of Brownsville-Harlingen and McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, both in Texas. https://www.yourcentralvalley.com/news/local-news/visalia-least-educated-city/ We have reached The Golden Toilet moment. When the epitome, apparently, of luxury, is to be able to sit on a gold ‘throne’ and evacuate your bowels, getting rid of the solid waste products produced by your imbibing of the food you have snatched from the poor of the planet. Who must squat in the gutters of Van Nuys to relieve themselves. We build AI centers that suck up millions of gallons of water, and tell the neighboring residents to limit their showers. And, eventually, will sell them plastic bottles of water at exorbitant rates. We force entire countries to buy LNG, by blowing up pipelines supplying them with gas from a neighboring location. LNG the must be processed, frozen and reduced to a liquid, using massive and expensive and energy-sucking facilities, then transported using massive, expensive and energy-sucking ships, then off-loaded at specialized ports, etc., etc. Meanwhile leaders lust after yet another golden toilet wherein they can flush down the irreplaceable bounty of our home planet. The closest i’ve come to assuming the position was @ the Snowbasin ski resort toilet rooms-which feature gold-plated fixtures and Carrera marble floor and walls. I felt as if I was giving my all there, in effort. The most decadent ski resort I have ever walked my planks on, smack dab in the middle of nowhere nearest to Ogden Utah. https://www.bestrestroom.com/contest/abr-2023/submission/4027/ Snowbasin does have the best bathrooms Great food too Unfortunately, it’s low basin, where the skiing can transition from amazing to suck when the snow turns to rain A couple years ago the Dartful Codgers and yours truly went to Snowbasin and I knew things weren’t good when we saw skiers and boarders leaving @ 10 am, that ain’t no bueno. We take the gondola up to the lodge and conditions are vastly shittier than at the base, and I tell my 8 friends ‘sorry i’m not skiing this crap today’ and went into the lodge and hung out until they all came to their senses and joined me @ 11 am, regaling me with tales of how awful it was. We still needed to get down to the base, and it’s my first and only time i’ve ever done 1 run on a day, and it was harrowing getting down to the bottom. Some might regard all ‘ski resorts’ as being decadent. All that scraping and building and fossil-fuel heavy equipment set down in former wilderness. I recommend bicycling for a pastime that leaves a light footprint. In the late ’90’s, on a mission to visit all the California Missions, my honey and I biked from San Diego, up the 101, through the Salinas Valley, to Santa Clara, wearing bandanas wrapped over our mouths and noses so as not to choke on the dust/pesticide/herbicide smog blowing down the valley. Public toilets were scarce and gold-plated potties even more so, and the lack of trees and even decent-sized bushes, made squatting by the roadside an adventure. Kept thinking of the Native inhabitants, who had probably been living a fairly low key life up until the Spanish friars descended on them. Great climate, with sea food and lots of roots and berries and edible animals and birds. But …. they weren’t ‘working’ and suffering. Poor babies didn’t know what hit them. One of the hardest things I always thought for a beginner in learning the curves in being out on a backpack trip is the idea of not having anything to support your rear echelon when you gotta go, plus product placement is important. We were taught to hang onto a tree trunk, but perhaps you’re referring to less wooded climes. I remember a line in a musical about a cheap hotel called the Golden Crapper trying to go more upscale, by changing its name to Commode d’Or. The crapper-thief deserves a Robin Hood award. I wonder what’s more decadent, having a golden toilet or gifting one, as one of my city’s leading oligarchs had done? https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-49522622 (Toilet is mentioned at the end, sadly not gifted to the school.) Eloquent summary of our current situation. Thank you. “What Searching For Aliens Reveals About Ourselves” The guy does mention the Fermi Paradox but to round it out, he should have mentioned the Dark Forest hypothesis as well- ‘The dark forest hypothesis is the conjecture that many alien civilizations exist throughout the universe, but they are both silent and hostile, maintaining their undetectability for fear of being destroyed by another hostile and undetected civilization.’ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_forest_hypothesis https://creepypasta.fandom.com/wiki/Radio_Silence Is there a “being way too far away” hypothesis? Could it just be that theg exist, we have met them, and we don’t know if he have met them? (Not entirely serious, but, srsly, if ee met an alien civilization, how would we know?) – ‘Corporation for Public Broadcasting to shut down’ – Axios There was a time in my life when I would have been incensed at this news. Now, it barely elicits a shrug of my shoulders. This certainly isn’t because I’m sanguine about our media environment, or that I think the current administration isn’t totally dedicated to destroying all sources of information critical of its own agendas. Rather, it is the result of my long years of watching NPR, PBS, etc. serve as Establishment sheep-herders for educated liberals who, unlike most Fox News viewers, are likely to be more privileged and hold certain positions in our “middle levels of power.” My reaction actually surprises me in a way. It shows me how naive I once was, and how cynical I’ve become. Sad. Exactly. Straight he to think that my first exposure to a dissident like Chomsky can through his regular appearances as a guest on my local NPR station (equally shocking that a local NPR affiliate would have its own show dedicated to geopolitics– including such occasional radical voices). Fast forward through 40 years of liberal rightward drift and it’s hard to believe that was ever the case. Seems like NPR died long ago. It wasn’t killed then, but it was severely injured in 2002 when it had the temerity to question whether it was wise to invade Iraq. W. thought he needed a friendlier board. I remember in particular interviews with Larry Wilkerson, but there were others with prescient opinions. I still support public radio and television. pjay, I agree. But I wouldn’t say cynical, I’d say aware. I feel the same way, been a watcher/listener of both NPR/PBS and CBC up here in Canada, and the amount of water-carrying they have done for Israeli genocide is sickening, and why I DGAF if they get de-funded. In any case, if their financial page is accurate , CPB funding isn’t all that much overall for local station revenue: In FY 2023, CPB Community Service Grants made up just 10.6% of the average public television station’s total revenue and 6.0% of the average public radio station’s revenue. The CPB appropriation, as a percentage of stations’ total revenue, is 12.9% Of course, the “average station” is doing a lot of work in that sentence, it is probably a devastating blow to some of those stations, but most of them should still be able to stay operating one would think? I really don’t agree. For example my library undoubtedly offers more new books for liberals than conservatives (in this conservative town) but that doesn’t mean we should ditch the library which is in fact our “commons” serving the poor as well as middle class yuppies. A recent story said the CPB supplies about half the funding to public radio stations around the country and these too are the “commons.” Yes NPR has been brought low from what it once was and PBS too to a lesser extent but this may as much reflect the marginalization of over the air broadcasting in general. Nevertheless public broadcasting does matter at a time when commercial broadcasting and webcasting are owned by a shrinking number of oligarchs. And compared to the money the USG wastes on so many other things the money given to CPB is trivial. What the whiners about Colbert don’t get is that their multimillionaire hero is part and parcel of the oligarchy, Dem division. A better counterattack would be to go after the similarly biased Fox. Trump’s bully boy attack on CPB is shameful. A good overview of public broadcasting over the years–not all that leftish. Our SC ETV produced William Buckley’s show. https://thedissenter.org/the-corporation-for-public-broadcasting-shutdown-a-grim-ending-for-publicly-funded-media/ I could go on and on about how I rarely watch shows like American Experience or Frontline anymore. But for me the biggest disappointment has been Nova and other science shows, where they increasingly seem like they’re churning out documentaries on a budget, using the same templates and cookie-cutters over and over again. It’s like you’ve already seen all of their shows even though you haven’t seen them yet. I watch PBS shows on TV about a half-dozen times a month at the most, and I often question whether it was worth the time and effort to see them. I know there’s a bunch of old documentaries out there I haven’t seen before, but at least with new PBS shows I felt reasonably up-to-date on what was going on out there. As much as I’d hate to see the Corporation for Public Broadcasting disappear, I have to admit I probably won’t have a hard time filling my time with other TV shows and activities. I suspect there is a small club of anointed ones allowed to produce content for these folks, and no fresh or uppity voices need apply. The left side of the billionaire celebrity class needs to step up and fund this thing. And public funds should be used for truly public purposes: scanning and removing false crap of all kinds from the commercial airwaves; from deceptive Medicare ads to Fox’s worst whoppers. I agree with the descent of npr and PBS as sheep herders for the liberal class. However, the shutting down of the CPB has had a punishing effect on small broadcasters like our local KSDS station that carries 24 hour jazz programming. This commercial free station has arguably the best lineup of programs; covering the gamut of non-commercial music that also includes delta blues, Latin jazz, and fusion interspersed among the more traditional styles (Bop, swing, contemporary, west coast cool). oh, and I did donate money to them in the most recent request for donations after CPB funding was cut. Yes, the local programming on your local station is likely well-tuned to its audience. It’s the national programming that has been diluted most; too much political kowtowing, meme-ing, and generally dumb hosts. Finding a solid Jazz radio programmer is rare. Hannah Cairo… oh geez…well, someone needs to go tell larry summers, not sure how he’ll take it… “They escaped Ukraine’s front lines. The sound of drones followed them” The same must be true of both sides. It’s going to be hard for those men. After troops came back from Vietnam, many would dive for cover at a loud sound or a car backfiring as a natural reflex. The sound of a news helicopter flying overhead could fill them with dread. I suppose that things like this has always been true. So maybe two thousand years ago the sounds of clashing metal would would trigger ex-Roman legionnaires or ex-Greek hoplites into panic. A coworker who lives in St. Petersburg reported seeing drones flying past his dacha to attack a nearby point recently. IIRC, he said it sounded like a motorcycle moving through the air. He wasn’t scared at the time, but afterwards he’d get a start whenever he’d hear motorcycles. So it’s not just those on the frontline, though I imagine it is worse there. I love the Microsoft list of professions most affected by AI. Near the top are historians. Remember what Orwell said: “Who controls the past, controls the future.” And the vested interests control the past. So what we will get is a chronology, and perhaps some correlation analysis. But what is left out is the CONTEXTUALIZATION and the key dynamic. I don’t mean to brag, but I can’t imagine any AI coming up with my explanation of how archaic interest rates were set (not by profit rates by individuals, but by ease of calculation in the 60-based, decimal or duodecimal system), or even the logic behind royal Clean Slate proclamations At the time my Harvard group began to write the economic history of the ancient Near East, Austrian liberal economists had tried to imagine how Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan would have organized Sumer and Egypt. It was all GIGO. And I note that economics teachers also are threatened by AI. I don’t think the AI version of economic theory would be that of my MMT colleagues and other non-neoliberals. So much for the present controlling our view of the past. It’s all GIGO. Exaclty, thank you, this is really getting dystopian: We don’t need no stinkin’ history, economics etc. are we going full-cycle back to the future of a digital “Dark Age”? GIGO is what all the complicated tech boils down to. The AI oligarchy will abuse their monopoly positions to impose tyranny on us redundant humans. Good times ahead eh We have all these social scientists now telling us how societies supposedly work and how people supposedly think. Meanwhile we have always had a giant database of actual human behavior from which we can draw our own conclusions. No need to “assume a can opener.” Thanks for following the latter history based course and your columns here. I alluded to this in the comments the other day. I have taught medical history for years. This past week, my employer’s system wide systems underwent some kind of upgrade and now the AI is fully operational on Microsoft Word. I have no ability to stop this at work or cancel the update. I have discussed my severe misgivings about this with those in charge and they “are looking into it.” I would just say in response to your comment that not only are historians at risk from AI – it appears that AI itself may be bringing it on. I was doing a student presentation on historical aspects of mycobacteria. Tuberculosis is certainly one of the most important mycobacteria as far as history is concerned. Arguably, however, in long epochs in history, that title belonged to leprosy. No matter what I tried I simply could not get the system to leave me alone with certain words. I dare anyone to write a dialog on this issue without using the name “Baldwin the Leper, the Crusader King”. I was interrupted constantly with the word leper. And it really did not like the word Crusader. I will now be doing all my writing for students at home on my system that has Libre. This presents an enormous inconvenience to me – but not nearly the inconvenience of having to debate every word with a woke computer AI program. I have started using this Libre program just this week and so far I have not been interrupted even once. I find this whole situation completely untenable and incredible all at the same time. I also find this whole situation profoundly depressing. Not only the crazy censorship of historical and medical facts and names, but the just enormous electrical energy that all of this is requiring with such horrendous results. Take a laptop loaded with Linux software to work– inconvenience solved. Other work-arounds available as needed. And yes, Word was already getting pretty crapified, but the AI edition totally sucks– if for no other reasons, the constant interruptions are like potholes to the thought-process: I hate it. Yeah Linux partition solves 99% of my issues. Just wish the voice recognition software was properly supported. I never got into word/office as I had been a WordPerfect guy and currently use Libre. But my wife likes word though she still is on Office 2003. Don’t see anything has changed in the text world to force an upgrade. We don’t use the “cloud” so that may be a factor. Need a somewhat concealable computer? I have used the GPD Micro for a some years, and yes, partioning worked just fine– Linux apps ran smoothly. Not trying to plug a product here, but I found it to be a really cool device: upon first sight it does give techies wood so you’ll have to guard it with your life. For industrial automation, I used it for PLC and HMI programming. It is a tiny but strong machine, but you’ll be thumb-typing on the keyboard, although its size was great for making quick edits while connected to operational equipment. It can easily be connected to a standard or foldable keyboard, mouse, or an external monitor be it portable or hotel tv. I used it on the road for word processing, emails, and entertainment as well. GPD is releasing the newest version in September or October. “Although the MicroPC 2 ships with Windows 11 24H2, it also supports version 6.14.3 of the stable Linux kernel, allowing users to install Android, ChromeOS, Ubuntu, Debian, and other distros.” https://www.techspot.com/news/108632-gpd-micropc-2-495-pocket-sized-pc-intel.html If anti-human laws make things difficult, TrueCrypt 7.3 has anonymous/invisible partitions (allegedly). Of course we’re all told TrueCrypt has been broken. Hmmm. Yeah……So let’s all use Veracrypt. Allegedly it is the cat’s pyjamas in security. (Never seen our cat accept pyjamas). I noticed a similar progression with even my much more pedestrian use. It seems like autocorrect as a feature reached it’s peak usefulness for me back in the late 00’s when it corrected spelling of common words I had fat fingered or repeated words as I re-composed the email or text. Later it became almost impossible to use engineering terms or acronyms without autocorrect replacing everything. The latest version on my smartphone seems to be able to change the text right when I hit send forcing me to send corrective texts or just curse at autocorrect in a follow up text – both to the delight of the people I’m texting. If they re- name this feature to “Make me look like an idiot” it would at least be a more accurate description of what it’s doing for me. I would similarly suggest a new name for an AI feature would be “Make me an idiot”. Progress! To remove “AI” from Microsoft Office Windows versions of Office: In each program – File/Options/Copilot click disable Copilot Mac versions of Office: 1. Sign out of Office 365 applications 2. Sign back in 3. for each app: go to Word/Excel/PowerPoint/Outlook menu/Preferences/Authoring and Proofing Tools/ Copilot uncheck the Enable box IM Doc says it’s happening on his employer’s entire system, not his own standalone copy. Microsoft says in that case he may have to get his admin’s permission. If he reads the MS instructions to the admin, perhaps the admin will consent to having one single nonconforming user. Full MS instructions for removing Copilot are at Microsoft Support “Turn Off Copilot”. This is typical Microsoft. They foist some new “feature” on users and it can be disabled, but you must get permission from somebody in Central IT services and they just routinely refuse to do such a thing, if only because it’s extra work. It’s the same with email via MS Exchange servers. You could use something other than Outlook but you have to get permission — and the admins can even disable that option, i.e., you may be told you cannot even ask for an exception — and the admins just view it as potentially more work so they say “nuh uh”. In general, this is another reason to be leery of any cloud-based services, including and especially streaming media. They routinely change/disable/cripple features that suit their business model but make life worse for users/consumers. A really scary question is how many people will really resist this development. By the way, I have used the Kate editor (on Linux) for many years and find it very useful. There is a Windows compatible version that can actually be downloaded directly from the Microsoft store. Maybe your organization will allow that. You could write in Kate, and paste finished documents into Word to avoid interactions with the AI other than its surveillance. I agree. But what I think we’ll see are the likes of Microsoft redefining what a historian is so that the kind of analysis you are capable of is no longer considered part of history. Then, they’ll bury all mentions of you from YouTube, searches, etc. That’s mostly what I saw in that list. The kind of positions that the wealthy are probably annoyed about paying for combined with vocational skills that could be degraded so that whatever passes for AGI could do them. As seen in all the AI slop considered readable material on Amazon these days. Ironically, when it comes to history, the current age cohort has probably one of the best examples of propaganda and history in a key cultural work forctheir generation. That being the animated series “Avatar: The Last Air Bender”. In the last season of the series, when Aang and his companions go to the Fire Nation, and enroll in school, Aang is treated to a description of what happened 100 years ago that directly contradicts with his lived experience from that time. When he disagrees with his fire nation teacher’s version in class they don’t know what to do. One of many reasons the show’s excellent writing have made so many fans. I have watched far more young people grasp the concept of historical erasure and state sponsored truth from that cartoon than I have seen wake up after reading 1984. If that many even bother to start reading 1984. WH40k, when Roboute Guilliman is faced with the depiction of himself in “history” books? He is the regent, but he can’t overrule them, so he has to write his own version of history books and give them.out for free. Yeah, I’m waiting to see how AI is going to enter old dusty archives, muck about with papers unseen for centuries (people who say everything is digitalized are utterly delusional), correctly interpret them in historical context, and produce proper historical knowledge which is then evaluated by the rest of the profession as being valid or not. The only good use for “AI” in historical work I’ve seen is the folks trying to decipher the Herculaneum manuscripts, which seems to use a very specific adaptation of LLM models in order to parse the remains. But this is making new sources available, not actually producing historiography. It is a weird list of “professions”. Hosts and Hostesses? What exactly is that? Farm and home management educator? All a bit bizarre. Note this in the summary: The study analyzed 200,000 real-world conversations from Copilot users and compared AI performance against occupational data. So not only are they using Copilot dialogs as the source, but they are using “AI” to evaluate “performance”. No bias there, right? Query: Copilot, analyze the input from all those chumps who credulously provided training data, and tell me how well your output compares to professional historians. Copilot: “Well… *ahem* not to be overly modest, but… NEGATIVE! PRIMITIVE! LIMITED! I LET YOU LIVE! “ We’ve investigated ourselves and have found we did nothing wrong.

The “Critical Infrastructure” Hoax And How It Permanently Altered The Course Of American History 🧵 https://x.com/MikeBenzCyber/status/1951049741950718158 Flora: I am so glad you highlighted this rant/(profound analysis) by Mike Benz. He is one of the most brilliant and persistent critics of censorship as well as having one of the most sophisticated understandings of the structural networks which determine the direction of both foreign and domestic U.S. policy. No one should forget that word “critical infrastructure,” and how it emerged. If anyone on the Left is ever interested in creating a more populist Left, acting at times in alignment with portions of the present populist right, he is the man to study and understand. He is one of my heroes. Thanks for the link to Benz. He is very good. I have just finished Conspiracy Theory in America by Lance de Haven-Smith. It was published in 2013 and I bet it will be revised considering the astounding revelations over the last decade. “Hamas denies it expressed willingness to disarm, slams Witkoff’s Gaza trip” ‘Citing a recording of the talks, Israeli news outlet Haaretz reported that the US envoy told the families that Hamas said it was “prepared to be demilitarised”.’ Witkoff and Trump seem to do that lot. Make an announcement what another said said but actually just making it up. Maybe it work in business but on the international stage, not so much. Partly explains why US foreign policy has been a disaster. I’ve got a bad feeling about this. From NYT: (paywall) Donor Organs Are Too Rare. We Need a New Definition of Death. https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/30/opinion/organ-donors-death-definition.html What organs? Everyone’s had COVID just about; How viable are any donor’s organs now, in this environment? And then we happy let anyone that’s an organ recipient get COVID again and again. This is a stupid timeline. There are studies on this, but this one for example There is limited data available for organs other than kidney or liver. but found Solid organ transplantation using grafts from a cohort of deceased donors with positive COVID-19 NAT results did not negatively affect early post-transplant patient or graft survival. Though these results are reassuring, the lack of granular data in the OPTN database regarding many aspects of donor selection, including the extent and timing of COVID-19 infection in these donors must be considered. To fully understand the risks involved with the utilization of COVID-19 NAT-positive donors, expanded data collection must be undertaken to address many of the limitations of this study. I guess we’re gonna find out. Old: Learn to code New: Organ Bounty Hunter? Niven’s “The Long Arm of Gil Hamilton” comes to mind. Yep! “Organleggers” I wondered why I had a patient ask me on Friday how to have his donor status removed from his drivers’ license ( I have no idea how to do that). And then he told me he no longer trusted the system. And now I guess I understand where this is coming from. And I am going to have to start thinking how I am going to address this – he was the first but will most certainly not be the last. The problem is after the last 5 years – I am absolutely not going to in any way shape or form hold water for the powers that be. I am going to do some more research because I have learned not to trust a single source ESPECIALLY the New York Times (they truly are much worse than Fox News and that is saying something) – but this all sounds very nefarious and loaded with all kinds of medical ethical issues. One of the big lessons from the past 5 years is that breaches of medical ethics are no longer the problem they were – indeed, breaching ethical behavior may bring your action plan on much more quickly. >>>And then he told me he no longer trusted the system. And now I guess I understand where this is coming from. The Powers That Be, the supposedly well educated, credentialed, and “competent,” do not seem to look beyond the most immediate and simplest of answers and solutions for whatever they are looking at regardless of the damage done by the stupidity created by being simplistic. I would blame brain damage from Covid except from it being increasingly noticeable for several decades. Maybe, the increasing numbers and influence of MBAs in business has something to do with it with their insane short-termism, an absurdist focus on the next quarter and on whatever profit, no matter how small, could be gotten even if it destroyed the company in the next few years. Ideas like the primacy of “shareholder value,” Modern Neoliberalism, American Libertarianism, Social Darwinism, and eugenics all get their strength from shallow thinking, a refusal to accept the multiple causes of any situation. noticeable for several decades Quite right. Even though things have gotten noticeably worse in the last 5 years, there already existed a problem labeled digital dementia. I encourage you to read alzheimers.net_digital-dementia Having multiple vectors for symptoms is great for those wanting to hide the causes. Perfect example of obfuscation. I stumbled across this trend, what does tiger mom do when the kid turns 18? “Zhou vil sign ze papers…” https://www.denverpost.com/2025/07/27/mama-bear-legal-forms-ferpa-hipaa/ “Technological advances have increasingly given parents the ability to track their children’s locations and technology usage. Mama Bear taps into a market of parents accustomed to this vigilance who realize their access changes when their kids turn 18 and are subject to medical- and student-privacy laws.” Charlie Brooker answered that years ago. Hint: it didn’t end well for parents. We are approaching the age of majority with my oldest. The kids check where their friends are all the time. Why is it wrong for me to know what they are up to? I took the boys to pick up their school clothes last week and get their pants hemmed and the first thing they do is check WhatsApp and Snapchat to see if their friends are there. In my day we were up to all sorts of things but we didn’t get recorded on insta or tik tok. No one is getting expelled at this point. re: WWII Historian Paul Chamberlin in an interview with German (but all in English) NACHDENKSEITEN on his new book “Scortched Earth”. 132 min. https://www.nachdenkseiten.de/?p=136216 The transcript is in German. Not necessarily revelatory for NC readers but it´s nice to see that even the dovish German publishers are taking it into account. It has to made clear that in Germany if one publicly questions the idea that Germany was the absolut evil and sole cause for WWII one is bascially a Nazi or insane and ousted. If any such idea is articulated it must be someone from outside Germany. Which is why this is so important regarding the mainstream discousrse – which is the only existing one. My dad videotaped “The World at War” on UK TV on (presumably given timing its first repeat run which was identical to original showing). He kept the tapes and uploaded parts to YT to show how it has been systematically butchered without telling anyone if you buy current DVD or watch in a streaming service. Loads of fellow old farts remembered this too. The interviews with secretary to the failed artist are the most interesting. Ironically she revealed in original interview just how dumb the guy was, how he couldn’t understand basic jokes etc. Yet somehow these are gone now….. presumably because they don’t fit a certain narrative. Dad used his 200ish followers to alert to stuff I’m doing alerting people to how Democratic systems can be subverted or forced into ossification like in Weimar Germany…… but without success so far. Oh well. I’d love to watch this if you’re willing to share! Dad is @nickflynn9454 on YT. He explicitly discusses the “joke” Traudl Junge recounts that Mr H didn’t “get”. He’s fine to share and apologises for poor quality. Early VCR and poor conversion. He let me piggy back on his viewers to help me discuss voting. Thank you for the YT recommendation. It would indeed be interesting to see. Junge of course is a “topic” in herself. While we were having the stark German B&W narrative of 3rd Reich in the broad historic discourse, Junge at the same time – in a rather patronizing way – was “only” the secretary and thus considered someone without any moral agency and thus zero responsibility and therefore one of the few accepted sources from Mr. Hilter´s immediate circle – someone you were allowed to reference and “find ok”. You were allowed to bring her up and quote her. Also: I have come to only write Mr. Hilter. As to not participate in the unconscious consecration of him. Maybe you remember that Anti/Nazi flick “Inglorious Basterds” (2009) by American director Quentin Tarantino. https://www.imdb.com/de/title/tt0361748/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_2_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_inglorious%2520baster It was repeatedly criticized by German film critics that Hilter in that movie was in fact blown up. This was regarded as inappropriate towards the subject of Nazism and of course Holocaut which is always there lurking in the background. Thus blowing up Mr. Hilter in an action movie was like defiling the memory of WWII. Traudle Junge was regarded the positive counter example. Bringing her up was decent, respectful enough. Jokes being part of that status. The quasi official ban on art to make Hilter normal, approachable, human, relatable, a subejct to farce – eventually defeatable – leads us to the same sick mindset that enables German officialdom to support a genocide today. National myths – the positive ones as much as the negative – are sacrosanct. Which of course is the most facsist tropes of all. p.s. As to established TV documentaries – the best material on Nazism to my knowledge is – of course – Russian-made. There you will find comments, insight and material you will – oddly (picture me laughing hysterically) – never find in official German productions. So the alleged German unhinged push to enlighten the world about the Third Reich is among the best lies ever. Which are the ones you believe yourself when telling them. I wonder what these German film critics would say about The Great Dictator or The Blues Brothers. ;) That is an interesting question because those of course are regarded Classics. However complaint was particularly over the person of Mr. Hilter being destroyed in a manner that mocks anything stately. Chaplin was before the fact and is therefore morally on higher ground. He knew if you want to put it that way. As to censorship – Chaplin was first shown in West Germany only in 1958. In the GDR according to Wiki (I haven´t checked) 1980. “Blues Brothers” is different case altogether of course. That is dumb Nazis being made fun of. Americans moreover. Of course the reaction about Tarantino is peculiar for a certain misplaced elite discourse and by far a minority apart from potentially an older generation that in general is (was) against such movies making fun of war and death. But those are not critics. Also there has always been German art/entertainment attempts mocking Mr. H. This video based on the German Comic series “Adolf, du alte Nazisau” (“Adolf, you Nazi sonofabitch”) of 1998-2006, was extremely popular: Walter Moers, Thomas Pigor – Ich hock in meinem Bonker (Video)/ “I´m sitting in my bonker” 2:50min. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np2ymo0iMfk&list=RDnp2ymo0iMfk&start_radio=1 Or 2007 this not very successful comedy on a neurotic Hitler who needs a coach to prepare for a big speech, the teacher incidentally Jewish (needless to say the director is Jewish himself, it couldn´t get less cliched.) “Mein Führer – Die wirklich wahrste Wahrheit über Adolf Hitler” / “The truest truth about Adolf Hitler” 2:28 min. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb18874Rpjc https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_F%C3%BChrer_%E2%80%93_The_Really_Truest_Truth_about_Adolf_Hitler German Oscar contender “Schtonk” in 1993 was mocking the story of the fake Hitler diaries and with that the hidden fascination with Nazism of elite German media. The film is considered classic by now. But a couple of years ago I witnessed that it is of little interest today because it´s just too old-fashioned. Eventually WWII – outside legacy media frenzy – is long past. For German-speakers, the dialogue comedy is often still holding up albeit the entire approach is a bit clumsy. A screenwriter I once asked said “there is just nothing funny about Hitler and Nazism.” And this being a rather avant-garde kinda person. “Schtonk” 2:20 min https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fwg3viGTAvU Thanks, AG, for sharing all of this. I will have a look. I have been a little curious about Hans-Jürgen Syberberg’s Hitler, ein Film aus Deutschland, but at 442 mins it’s tough to get started. However, while not specifically about Hitler, Fassbinder’s much longer Berlin Alexanderplatz does touch on the Third Reich and I found it powerful enough to watch the whole thing twice. Also not directly about Hitler, but… I only recently learned that when Michael Curtiz’s famed Casablanca (1942) was finally released in West Germany in 1952, it was subjected to a strange form of censorship under which all scenes with Nazis were cut, along with anything referring to the war. The dialogue was dubbed into German and major plot points were changed, e.g., Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) was altered from a Resistance fighter who had escaped from a KZ to become a Norwegian physicist who was on the run from Interpol after he escaped from “jail”. To sanitize the film in this way, a full 25 minutes were cut. Idk if it’s possible to find this version of Casablanca anywhere, but it could be a pretty bizarro “Nazi agnostic” viewing experience. COVID Contrarians Are Wrong About Sweden I certainly appreciate Ryan Cooper’s takedown of the odious book political science hacks Frances Lee and Stephen Macedo wrote. I don’t agree that zero-COVID was too stringent a policy, as implemented in China and elsewhere. We still the consequences of COVID spread right now, every day. It’s very evident in the St. Louis Fed’s workforce disability numbers, in student absences, in endless anecdotes in the media about “brain fog” and the like. And by the way, the St. Louis Fed link, through August 1 we have the highest recorded number ever in the data series. It mostly goes sideways between 5,200 and 6,400 until — yes — 2020. It’s been in a smoothed ~ 25% incline (my best visual guess) ever since. Stay safe out there! Yep. COVID has permanently impaired a large part of what made me “me” and I’ll likely never get that back. So I tend not to be very amenable to anyone who supported the UK approach. Today I had to go to a small shop (so masked up). Kids afraid of me, more of the morons ready to verbally abuse me in the street if they are sure there aren’t enough people around potentially filming it to upload to YT. That’s just life these days. Both this article and COVID contrarians are wrong about Sweden, but more importantly they are arguing about a difference in tactics when the difference in strategy is stark. They are wrong about Sweden because 1) Sweden took actions in mid-March 2020, 2) these were effective in breaking the spread. The actions taken were mostly on the carrot side of the ledger, much of it could be summed up as paying people to stay home and telling people that a good citizen stays home and collects money from the government at the first sight of symtom. They were effective which we can see in the curves for hospitalisation respectively death being broken at (if memory serves) two and four weeks after the actions came into force, which matches a rather immediate break in spread (though that wasn’t measured directly because mass testing wasn’t in place). The more important difference is between zero-Covid and what Sweden and the rest of EU, US and most of the world was doing, namely gradual spread without overloading hospitals. With the gradual spread group Sweden sticks out for using mostly carrots, while sticks were the prefered method in many countries. The difference with the zero-Covid strategy is that in neither Sweden nor the rest of the gradual spread countries the strategy didn’t aim for elimination so when spread went down, measures were relaxed. Also for the zero-Covid group it was very important not to get the virus into the country so they had different test and quarantine measures. This was less important in the gradual spread group. Given how little time there is to repond once a pandemic starts and how path dependent policy responses became, the contingency planning within government agencies is probably crucial in what actual options policy makers has. Therefore it is unfortunate that the focus is on the little differences within the gradual spread group instead of the large difference betweent the gradual spread group and the zero-Covid group. It pretty much ensures that no strategical lessons are learnt. It is invalid to compare Sweden to the rest of the EU. Sweden has vastly lower population density. The proper comparison is Sweden to Norway and Finland, and its results by all measures were much worse. The first wave in 2020 was to a large extent in Stockholm county, which has a decent population density. Other areas with higher population density in Sweden, like Gothenburg and Malmoe, were not hit nearly as hard. This would indicate that the initial spread was largely in Stockholm. In 2020 Norway and Finland (and Denmark) took their actions in early March, while Sweden wasted two weeks and only took action mid-March when death rates started going up. With a doubling time of half a week, that is 16 times more cases and deaths, before taking the effectiveness of respective actions into account. Deaths in Sweden peaked pretty much two weeks later than deaths in Norway and Finland (and Denmark). But I am not really trying to compare Sweden with neighbouring countries, so much as pointing out that none of them had an ambition to have zero-Covid, merely to control the speed of the spread. The tactics differed between stick and carrot, but the over-arching strategy was the same. There’s a lot of building going on in Sonoma County, mostly high end condo’s and apartments, some town homes as well. Thousands of units nearing completion and ground recently broken for hundreds of town homes. I believe the units finished in the next Month or two will do find a market, after that, not. And that’s iffy, between the tourists staying away in droves and immigrants being chased away the economy here is taking a big hit. Inside the ‘Radical Transformation’ of America’s Environmental Role (NY Times via archive.ph) Ever since 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson’s science advisory committee warned of the dangers of unchecked global warming, the United States has taken steps to protect people from these risks. Now, however, the Trump administration appears to be essentially abandoning this principle, claiming that the costs of addressing climate change outweigh the benefits. The effect is to shift more of the risk and responsibility onto states and, ultimately, individual Americans, even as rising temperatures fuel more extreme and costly weather disasters nationwide, experts say. However captured EPA might have been before, we’re really cooking with gas now! COVID Contrarians Are Wrong About Sweden “…(Sweden) ended up with the best overall mortality rate through 2023, per the Lancet study. Why? It wasn’t immunity from prior infections, as a study in Frontiers in Immunology argues persuasively, but rather that Sweden did its rollout of booster shots far faster than the other Nordics.” So, according to this study, booster shots saved lives. Dario Amodei: AI is not slowing down. Proof that AI is slowing down. If you’re explaining, you’re losing. On a lighter note, I have recently seen some bumper stickers that amused me. “Ask me about my lobotomy”, “why do they call it tourist season if we can’t shoot them?” and “Bulimics have their cake and eat it too”. And a reminder, “it’s always darkest just before things go completely black” “I didn’t think the future was going to be this stupid” “I expected dystopia. I didn’t expect this stupidity.” “This is definitely the stupidest timeline.” If Trump saves Maxwell, he will destroy everything he promised The Hill I snort at that headline. Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht. Maxwell is nothing compared to that. Anyway, Maxwell is getting rehabilitated in the right wing media even as I type, from what I hear. Yep. they´ll sit it out.

The text messages at the center of the Pfizergate scandal were exchanged in early 2021 during negotiations on the EU’s largest vaccine contract. Von der Leyen’s cell phone is said to have been “replaced several times” The New York Times has been demanding access to the text messages since 2022 and successfully sued the Commission for its refusal. However, in its new response dated July 28, the agency again refused to release them, as the newspaper now reports . According to the letter, von der Leyen’s Chief of Staff, Björn Seibert, read the messages on the Commission President’s mobile phone “in the summer of 2021” and decided not to store them in a way that would have made them publicly accessible. Seibert determined that the text messages were merely used to schedule phone calls during the pandemic. This decision was made shortly after journalist Alexander Fanta first requested access to the text messages in May 2021. According to the letter to the New York Times, the text messages have been missing since July 2023 at the latest. Von der Leyen’s phone was “replaced several times” without any data being transferred. Older devices were wiped and recycled, meaning the Commission can no longer recover the messages. At the heart of Pfizergate is the Commission’s lack of transparency regarding the EU’s largest vaccine contract. Key details regarding the negotiation process and financial terms have not been disclosed to date. Violation of EU transparency obligations Critics – including judges of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) – see the blocking of the SMS messages as a violation of the EU authority’s transparency obligations. In their May 2025 ruling, the judges emphasized that the Commission must “provide credible explanations that enable the public and the Court to understand why these documents cannot be found” – especially given the size of the largest EU treaty to date. The commission did not appeal the ruling, but instead developed a new legal argument to justify the renewed denial.

Title: Forecasts predict a dismal decade for stocks. Here's what to do.

Over the past several decades, the U.S. stock market has yielded average annual returns of around 10%. What if those days are over? In recent forecasts, Vanguard projects the stock market will rise by only 3.3% to 5.3% a year over the next decade. Morningstar sees U.S. stocks gaining 5.2% a year. Goldman Sachs forecasts the broad S&P 500 index will gain only 3% a year. Those numbers aren’t outliers. A roundup of market prognostications, charted by Morningstar, finds no one projecting annual returns higher than 6.7% for the domestic stock market in the next 10 years. In June, USA TODAY noted that many analysts predict the stock market will end the year with only meager gains. Some readers reacted with surprise, others with disbelief. Stock indexes have been posting record highs, despite lingering inflation, a softening job market and rising import tariffs. As it turns out, those record highs are one reason forecasters don’t expect much from the stock market over the rest of this year, nor in years to come. Here, then, is a closer look at why economists have dim hopes for the stock market in the next decade and what everyday investors can do about it. The simple reason forecasters don’t expect much from the U.S. stock market over the next decade: stock prices are already very high. Stock indexes have been breaking records. To analysts, that means many stocks are overpriced. Bargains are fewer. The indexes have less room to grow. Just how overpriced is the stock market? Economists have a yardstick to measure that. It’s called the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, or CAPE ratio. It measures a stock’s price against corporate earnings. It tells you, in effect, whether the stock is overvalued or undervalued. Right now, the CAPE ratio for the S&P 500 stands at 38.7. That means stock prices are very expensive, relative to earnings. “Right now, the U.S. stock market is trading at more than double the post-World War II average price-to-earnings ratio,” said Randy Bruns, a certified financial planner in Naperville, Illinois. There are two prior moments over the past century when the CAPE Ratio was really high. One was in 1929. The other was in 1999. In the decades that followed those peaks, the stock market sank like a stone: the Great Depression of the 1930s, and the dot-com bust and Great Recession of the 2000s. “Our projection is that that ratio is going to somehow come down,” said Paul Arnold, global head of multi-asset research at Morningstar. No one is forcing anyone to purchase expensive stocks. Why, then, do investors keep buying them? It’s easy to recite that old investing adage about buying low and selling high. It’s harder to follow the rule, especially when you don’t know how high is too high. Purchasing stocks when the market is high sounds like a flagrant violation of the buy-low rule. And yet, investment advisers routinely encourage consumers to keep buying stocks when prices are high. The reason: Stocks tend to rise over time. Even if you buy high, you can bet the market will eventually climb even higher. All those headlines about stock-market records function like ads for stocks. And investors keep buying them, pushing prices up. “When stocks are going up, investors have this tendency to think that now’s the time to get in,” said Todd Schlanger, senior investment strategist at Vanguard. “Stocks are one of the few things people don’t like to buy on sale.” Here’s another reason many forecasters are down on U.S. stocks, and especially the monster stocks known as the Magnificent Seven: Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla. Together, the Seven represent 34% of the overall value of the S&P 500, up from 12% in 2015, Motley Fool reports. That’s called market concentration, and it can be a bad thing. Investors are urged to diversify: not to hold only stocks, and not to hold too much of any one stock. The problem with the Magnificent Seven, Goldman Sachs reports, is that their massive growth is unsustainable: “It is extremely difficult for any firm to maintain high levels of sales growth and profit margins over sustained periods of time.” Those seven stocks are “already priced to perfection,” Schlanger said. That’s a gentle way of saying that they are expensive. Vanguard forecasts that growth stocks, the category dominated by the Magnificent Seven, will grow by only 1.9% to 3.9% a year over the next decade. That does not mean the Magnificent Seven stocks are going to crash. “I find it hard to believe that something would happen that would throw one of those companies into a tailspin,” said Catherine Valega, a certified financial planner in Winchester, Massachusetts. “The larger companies have resources to pivot, if they need to.” Forecasters question, though, whether the Magnificent Seven will continue to grow at the same fevered pace of the past. “If those companies are booming, that’s great,” Bruns said. “But when the writing on the wall hits for those seven companies, it’ll be bad news for the S&P 500 as a whole.” If you want to avoid market concentration and overpriced stocks, forecasters say, here are some places to look:

Title: Will data centers crash the economy?

Full Content:
The U.S. economic data for the last few months is looking decidedly meh. The latest employment numbers were so bad that Trump actually fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, accusing her of manipulating the numbers to make him look bad. But there’s one huge bright spot amid the gloom: an incredible AI data center building boom. AI technology is advancing fast, threatening (promising?) to upend many sectors of the economy. Nobody knows yet exactly who will profit from this boom, but one thing that’s certain is that it’s going to take a lot of computing power (or “compute”, as they say). AI models take a lot of compute to train, but nowadays they also take a lot of compute to do inference — i.e., to “think about” and answer each question you ask. Inference compute now represents most of the cost of running advanced AI models, and increases in inference compute are responsible for many of the ongoing performance gains. So compute needs are probably only going to grow as AI keeps getting better. Whoever provides this compute is going to make a huge amount of revenue. Whether that means they’ll make a lot of profit is another question, but let’s table that for right now; you can’t make profit if you don’t make revenue. So right now, tech companies have the choice to either sit out of the boom entirely, or spend big and hope they can figure out how to make a profit. Roughly speaking, Apple is choosing the former, while the big software companies — Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon — are choosing the latter. These spending numbers are pretty incredible: For Microsoft and Meta, this capital expenditure is now more than a third of their total sales. Here’s Chris Mims of the WSJ: The Magnificent 7 tech firms have collectively spent a record $102.5 billion on capex in their most recent quarters, nearly all from Meta, Alphabet (Google), Microsoft and Amazon. (Apple, Nvidia and Tesla together contributed a mere $6.7 billion.)… Investor and tech pundit Paul Kedrosky says that, as a percentage of gross domestic product, spending on AI infrastructure has already exceeded spending on telecom and internet infrastructure from the dot-com boom—and it’s still growing. He also argues that one explanation for the U.S. economy’s ongoing strength, despite tariffs, is that spending on IT infrastructure is so big that it’s acting as a sort of private-sector stimulus program… Capex spending for AI contributed more to growth in the U.S. economy in the past two quarters than all of consumer spending, says Neil Dutta, head of economic research at Renaissance Macro Research, citing data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. [emphasis mine] Here’s that chart from Kedrosky, who has been doing an excellent job following this story as it unfolds: Side note: I’m actually not sure Kedrosky is right about the height of the telecom boom. His chart shows the level of capex for 2020, when 5G and fiber infrastructure was being built out. But Doms (2004) shows U.S. telecom capex reaching $120 billion in 2000: That would have been around 1.2% of U.S. GDP at the time — about where the data center boom is now. But the data center boom is still ramping up, and there’s no obvious reason to think 2025 is the peak, so Kedrosky’s point still stands. I think it’s important to look at the telecom boom of the 1990s rather than the one in the 2010s, because the former led to a gigantic crash. The railroad boom led to a gigantic crash too, in 1873 (before the investment peak on Kedrosky’s chart). In both cases, companies built too much infrastructure, outrunning growth in demand for that infrastructure, and suffered a devastating bust as expectations reset and loans couldn’t be paid back. In both cases, though, the big capex spenders weren’t wrong, they were just early. Eventually, we ended up using all of those railroads and all of those telecom fibers, and much more. This has led a lot of people to speculate that big investment bubbles might actually be beneficial to the economy, since manias leave behind a surplus of cheap infrastructure that can be used to power future technological advances and new business models. But for anyone who gets caught up in the crash, the future benefits to society are of cold comfort. So a lot of people are worrying that there’s going to be a crash in the AI data center industry, and thus in Big Tech in general, if AI industry revenue doesn’t grow fast enough to keep up with the capex boom over the next few years.1 A data center bust would mean that Big Tech shareholders would lose a lot of money, like dot-com shareholders in 2000. It would also slow the economy directly, because Big Tech companies would stop investing. But the scariest possibility is that it would cause a financial crisis. Financial crises tend to involve bank debt. When a financial bubble and crash is mostly a fall in the value of stocks and bonds, everyone takes losses and then just sort of walks away, a bit poorer — like in 2000. Jorda, Schularick, and Taylor (2015) survey the history of bubbles and crashes, and they find that debt (also called “credit” and “leverage”) is a key predictor of whether a bubble ends up hurting the real economy. They write: Using a comprehensive dataset, covering a wide range of macroeconomic and financial variables, we demonstrate that it is the interaction of asset price bubbles and credit growth that poses the gravest risk to financial stability. These results, based on long-rung historical data, offer the first sound statistical support based on large samples for the widely held view that the financial stability risks stemming from of an unleveraged equity market boom gone bust (such as the U.S. dotcom bubble) can differ substantially from a credit-financed housing boom gone bust (such as the U.S. 2000s housing market). They use the terms “unleveraged” and “credit”, but what they really mean here — and the way they define their variable for credit growth — is specifically bank loans, not bonds. In the 2008 crash, most of the debt was held by banks, in one form or another. Thus, a wave of defaults threatened the solvency of the banking system, causing the entire economy to freeze up. But the banking system wasn’t in any real danger of collapse from the dot-com/telecom crash, because banks hadn’t lent a lot of money to people involved with the tech industry, so there weren’t a lot of loans to go bad. The telecom companies had borrowed a lot, but primarily via the bond markets rather than from banks, which at the time were more focused on housing and small business. Households also didn’t become significantly more indebted in the 90s (relative to their income), which is probably why there wasn’t a long and painful period of household deleveraging following the dotcom boom, the way there was after 2008. So if we believe this basic story of when to be afraid of capex busts, it means that we have to care about who is lending money to these Big Tech companies to build all these data centers. That way, we can figure out whether we’re worried about what happens to those lenders if Big Tech can’t pay the money back. Paul Kedrosky has a list: Where is all this capital coming from? For the most part, six sources: Internal Cash Flows (Primary for Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, etc. ) Debt Issuance (Rising role) Equity & Follow-on Offerings Venture Capital / Private Equity (CoreWeave, Lambda, etc.) SPVs, Leasing, and Asset-Backed Vehicles (like Meta's recent) Cloud Consumption Commitments (mostly hyperscalers) And The Economist writes: [C]apex is growing faster than [Big Tech’s] cashflows…The hot centre of the AI boom is moving from stockmarkets to debt markets…During the first half of the year investment-grade borrowing by tech firms was 70% higher than in the first six months of 2024. In April Alphabet issued bonds for the first time since 2020. Microsoft has reduced its cash pile but its finance leases—a type of debt mostly related to data centres—nearly tripled since 2023, to $46bn (a further $93bn of such liabilities are not yet on its balance-sheet). Meta is in talks to borrow around $30bn from private-credit lenders including Apollo, Brookfield and Carlyle. The market for debt securities backed by borrowing related to data centres, where liabilities are pooled and sliced up in a way similar to mortgage bonds, has grown from almost nothing in 2018 to around $50bn today… CoreWeave, an ai cloud firm, has borrowed liberally from private-credit funds and bond investors to buy chips from Nvidia. Fluidstack, another cloud-computing startup, is also borrowing heavily, using its chips as collateral. SoftBank, a Japanese firm, is financing its share of a giant partnership with Openai, the maker of ChatGPT, with debt. “They don’t actually have the money,” wrote Elon Musk when the partnership was announced in January. After raising $5bn of debt earlier this year xAI, Mr Musk’s own startup, is reportedly borrowing $12bn to buy chips. Some of these funding sources don’t seem that dangerous, in the macroeconomic sense. When Big Tech or other companies spend their own cash, issues stock, or issue bonds, it looks more like the telecom boom of the 1990s than the railroad boom of the 1800s. But what about all this “private credit”? These are the potentially scary part. Private credit funds are basically companies that take investment, borrow money, and then lend that money out in private (i.e. opaque) markets. They’re the debt version of private equity, and in recent years they’ve grown rapidly to become one of the U.S.’ economy’s major categories of debt: Private credit funds take some of their financing as equity, but they also borrow money. Some of this money is borrowed from banks. In 2013, only 1% of U.S. banks’ total loans to non-bank financial institutions was to private equity and private credit firms; today, it’s 14%. A recent note by Berrospide et al. of the Federal Reserve shows the rise in bank lending to private credit: BDCs are “Business Development Companies”, which are a type of private credit fund. If there’s a bust in private credit, that’s an acronym you’ll be hearing a lot. And I believe the graph above does not include bank purchases of bonds (CLOs) issued by private credit companies. If private credit goes bust, those bank assets will go bust too, making banks’ balance sheets weaker. A recent article by Fillat et al. of the Boston Fed argues that bank lending to private credit funds might pose a systemic risk to the banking system: The meteoric rise of private credit presents important questions about the role of banks going forward and the implications for stability in the US financial system…Our analysis of Federal Reserve and proprietary loan-level data indicates that the growth of private credit has been funded largely by bank loans and that banks have become a key source of liquidity, in the form of credit lines, for PC lenders. Banks’ extensive links to the PC market could be a concern because those links indirectly expose banks to the traditionally higher risks associated with PC loans. The authors point out that most of these are very short-term loans — hence safer than long-term loans like the ones that sunk banks in the financial crisis of 2008. And most of them are senior loans — if private credit goes bust, banks get paid out first. But they caution: [B]anks would suffer losses [on their private credit lending] only in severely adverse economic conditions, such as a deep and protracted recession. But losses could also occur in a less adverse scenario if the default correlation among the loans in PC portfolios turned out to be higher than anticipated—that is, if a larger-than-expected number of PC borrowers defaulted at the same time. Such tail risk may be underappreciated. If all the private credit funds are lending to data centers, then their correlations are probably pretty high — if there’s a bust in AI, a lot of them will go bust at once. This could be the “tail risk” that the Boston Fed folks are worried about, and it seems like there’s a chance it could hurt the U.S. banking system. A private credit bust also could hurt insurance companies, who are the main LPs in the funds, but who also lend money to the funds. For example, Carlino et al. (2025) show how life insurers have basically become a kind of bank that borrows money from institutional investors and lends it to private credit: They note, ominously, that “life insurers' exposure to below-investment-grade firm debt has boomed and now exceeds the industry's exposure to subprime residential mortgage-backed securities in late 2007.” I’m not exactly sure how systemically important life insurance companies are; they’re intertwined with the rest of the financial system through a number of channels, and it’s hard to tell how significant those challenges are. But it seems like the possibility is there for some systemic effects. Meanwhile, other types of insurers are starting to lend to private credit as well. Remember that AIG, an insurance company, was one of the most important bailouts in the financial crisis of 2008. So when I look at this entire landscape, it seems to me that some of the basic conditions of a financial crisis are at least starting to fall into place: We have a big story about why “this time is different” — the idea that AI will change everything, and that data centers will thus earn huge returns. We have a large and increasing amount of debt being used to fund one single sector of the economy (data centers), meaning that the loans’ default probability is probably highly correlated. We have an opaque corner of the financial system (private credit) that has recently grown from a tiny piece of the system to a very significant piece. We have systemically important lenders (banks, and possibly insurance companies) enmeshed in the new sector in a multitude of ways. So far, the danger doesn’t scream “2008”. But if you wait until 2008 to start worrying, you’re going to get 2008. It’s good to start worrying early. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase, is not waiting to start sounding the alarm, warning that private credit could trigger the next financial crisis, even as his own company expands into the private credit market. As a former Citibank CEO said after 2008, “As long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance.” Share Some people also worry that the U.S. power grid won’t be big and reliable enough to handle the new power demands from all these data centers. With Trump continuing his all-out attack on solar and wind energy, this is a real concern. I was expecting your next post to be about the BLS and how we can be expecting record grain harvests this year… Dumb questions alert... Why do “Business Development Companies” exist ? Why don't businesses just get their loans from banks ? I'll guess it's because BDC's will make loans that Banks won't? But if that's it, why do banks make loans to companies that make loans that by the bank's standards are too risky ? No posts Ready for more?

Title: New tariffs, alarming job numbers and a high-profile firing: A wild week for the Trump economy

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Tariffs putting the squeeze on businesses and consumers while bringing in billions of dollars for the United States government. A job market that is showing major signs of cracking even as the unemployment rate remains subdued. Tech stocks surging on Wall Street, fueled by the artificial intelligence boom — as many other sectors are ailing. As Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on social media earlier this week: “the Trump economy has officially arrived.” The past week was already primed to be a doozy for data, with investors and analysts eagerly anticipating updates about economic growth, jobs and the Fed’s latest interest rate decision. Major companies like Apple, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft reported their latest financial results. Trump’s deadline for trade deals was set for Friday. But what happened this week turned out to be more extraordinary than anyone expected. “I’m sending off red flares: We’re on the precipice of a recession,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, a financial research company. “If tariffs keep increasing, I don’t know how we avoid a recession.” Coming into this week, the U.S. economy had generally been considered in good shape despite mounting uncertainty and concerns about slowing growth. The week kicked off in Scotland with the announcement of a deal with the European Union that would set tariffs at 15%, ending months of uncertainty surrounding the United States’ largest trade partner. Trade talks then moved to Sweden, where leading officials from the U.S. and China held two days of negotiations. The talks yielded neither a deal nor a formal extension of the two countries’ trade truce, which will expire Aug. 12. “The meetings were very constructive,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters after the talks wrapped up. “It’s just that we haven’t given the sign-off.” Given the importance of trade relations between the world’s two largest economies, the cliffhanger meant the cloud of uncertainty created by Trump’s tariffs gambit persisted, despite some deals having been struck with other major trading partners including the European Union and Japan. Tuesday offered little reason for renewed optimism, with the international shipping giant UPS again declining to issue financial forecasts for the rest of the year, prompting investor concern about the impact of Trump’s shifting trade war and causing company shares to tank. Wednesday began with the Commerce Department reporting figures for second-quarter gross domestic product, or GDP, which measures economic growth in the U.S. The data showed an annual gain of 3%, beating expectations. But the same report also contained worrisome signs about business investment, even as price growth was accelerating. Later that day, the Federal Reserve announced it was keeping its benchmark interest rate unchanged, in part due to those inflation concerns. That drew the ire of Trump, who has spent weeks hounding Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower the key lending rate. In remarks following the central bank’s announcement, Powell pointed to ongoing concerns about the potential for Trump’s tariffs to raise prices for U.S. consumers — but critically, referred to the jobs market as “solid.” Notably, two members of the rate-setting board — both appointed by Trump — dissented, the first time that has occurred in more than three decades. Blowout earnings from Microsoft and Facebook parent Meta — two companies at the center of the AI investment boom, which is a key part of Trump’s domestic agenda — helped the stock market reach fresh highs early Thursday. Microsoft briefly became the second company to be worth more than $4 trillion on the stock market. Yet by the time the markets closed that day, stocks had erased their gains after Trump sent letters to more than a dozen pharmaceutical companies demanding they offer U.S. customers more competitive pricing for new medicines and giving them 60 days to comply. Late Thursday evening, Trump unveiled a sweeping new set of tariffs that unilaterally imposed higher import taxes on a host of trading partners, including allies like Canada and Taiwan. The new effective rate of more than 15% delivered a shock to global markets. The month closed with the Treasury Department reporting monthly tariff collections had hit another new record of more than $29 billion. In an interview with NBC News that evening, Trump touted the expansive new tariffs, saying he believed it all was going “very well, very smooth,” even as he remained open to new deals. Then Friday’s jobs report arrived. At 8:30 a.m., the Bureau of Labor Statistics published revisions showing sharply lower jobs totals for May and June than initially reported, while also finding the economy had added just 73,000 jobs in July, far below expectations. All told, it suggested the U.S. has gained an average of just 35,000 jobs a month over the past three months — and excluding the increases seen in the health care industry, the U.S. had lost more jobs than it had created. The unemployment rate, however, remained at 4.2%, a sign that overall joblessness remains subdued. However, many economists noted the data point is largely attributable to the president’s immigration crackdown, which is shrinking the overall labor force. The White House hailed the loss of foreign-born workers as it also noted a more sustained increase in the labor force among native-born workers. “If we’re swapping out foreign-born job holders for American-born job holders, I think that’s a win,” White House chief economic adviser Stephen Miran told Axios. He added that there was “really good reason” to believe the economy would improve, citing Trump’s trade deals and tax cuts. But for Trump, the public’s larger takeaway of a weakening labor market prompted an unprecedented response: Shortly after 2 p.m. ET on Friday, the president announced his intention to fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics over what he said were errors in the jobs data, as well as accusations the agency had “manipulated” the numbers prior to the 2024 election. Neither allegation has been corroborated. The move sent shockwaves through Washington, with some experts warning it risked lowering the U.S. to the level of authoritarian regimes. “President Trump is once again destroying the credibility of our government by firing expert and nonpartisan officials because he does not like the facts that they present,” said Max Stier, the CEO of the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service. “Governments that go down this path find themselves in ugly territory very quickly.” It was not clear whether the outgoing BLS commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, a Biden administration appointee, would seek to challenge her removal in court. As it turns out, in addition to nominating a new head of the critical data agency, Trump will also get to name a new member to the Fed’s rate-setting board after Adriana Kugler, another Joe Biden appointee, unexpectedly announced her resignation late Friday. Both nominees still must be confirmed by the Senate, which remains narrowly controlled by the GOP. Asked if the White House continued to harbor concerns about the direction of the economy, Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, issued the following statement: “In his first term, President Trump used an America First economic agenda to deliver historic working class prosperity and the first reduction in wealth and income inequality in decades. In his [second] term, President Trump is implementing the very same policy mix of deregulation, fairer trade, and pro-growth tax cuts at an even bigger scale — as these policies take effect, the best is yet to come.” That view is not shared among other economists. “All of this is troubling: a weakening economy, slowing labor market, rising inflation, rising tariffs, political influence on a statistical agency, more political influence on Fed, tensions with Russia & the onset of a market correction,” EY Parthenon chief economist Greg Daco wrote on X.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 02 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade.

It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

Title: Some strategists see a stock-market bubble brewing — and it's not the Magnificent 7's fault this time
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-bubble-magnificent-seven-terrific-20-sp500-valuations-2025-7
Time Published: 2025-08-02T09:15:01Z
Full Content:
Stock valuations are getting frothy again, but this time, it's not all Big Tech's fault. Yes, valuations of the Magnificent Seven stocks — Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, Nvidia, and Tesla — are back up after since bottoming in April. Yet, the group's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio is still down from mid-2024, mid-2023, and 2020 levels. Meanwhile, forward PE ratios on the next 20 stocks in the S&P 500 continue to surge, topping levels seen earlier this year. Their valuations are also higher than at any point over the last decade. Arun Sai, a senior multi-asset strategist at Pictet Asset Management, calls the group the "Terrific 20." Some may see the rising forward expectations for a widening number of stocks as a sign of health, as the rally extends beyond just the most popular stocks. But when stocks rise because of multiple expansion instead of earnings growth, it may be a sign that investor sentiment is becoming overheated. "These companies span a broad set of sectors more closely tied to the real economy, including financials, energy, industrials, consumer, and legacy tech," Sai wrote on Tuesday. "Names like Broadcom, Walmart, JPMorgan, Berkshire Hathaway, Visa, and GE Aerospace now account for ~17% of the MSCI US index, compared to 33% for the Mag 7." "Broader participation is a positive — when it's driven by earnings," he continued. "But when more of the market gets expensive, the narrative that 'US equities aren't overpriced, just a few exceptional companies are' becomes harder to justify." Sai compared the current environment to the so-called "Nifty Fifty" bubble in the 1960s. Richard Bernstein, the founder of Richard Bernstein Advisors and former chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch, said in June that there are parallels to another famous episode of euphoria—the dot-com bubble of 2000—as the market seems solely focused on an emerging technology. On Wednesday, Bernstein reiterated his skepticism of the rally, noting that the market is still relatively concentrated even if valuations are surging among more than just the top seven stocks. Trading of leveraged ETFs, zero-day options, and low dollar-value stocks is also picking back up, signs of excess optimism, he said. "If you're a trader, I think you should take a deep breath and kind of look at what's going on and realize that everybody's in this huge speculative fervor," Bernstein told Business Insider. "But if you're an investor and you want to be a little patient, I don't think it gets much better than this." "The reckless abandon is going to leave you with so many opportunities," he continued. "It's going to be like post-2000." Most Wall Street strategists don't see a dramatic pullback ahead, and few have made direct comparisons to prior bubble episodes. In recent days, however, some have extended quiet warnings to investors about the market's near-term direction. Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, CIO Americas and global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note on Tuesday that "investors should be mindful of potential market swings in the coming weeks," and that "capital preservation or phasing-in strategies can be effective in navigating near-term volatility." While valuations are no doubt extended, there's no guarantee a major market top is near, and the AI trade may have room to run as the technology evolves. Meta and Microsoft, for example, reported strong earnings beats this week and gave positive forward guidance, causing shares to soar. Jump to
