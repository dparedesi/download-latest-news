As the artificial intelligence trade continues to push the stock market to new highs, investors are increasingly asking if we’re living through another financial bubble that’s destined to burst. The answer isn’t so simple, at least according to history. The S&P 500 Index jumped 16% in 2025, with AI winners Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Microsoft Corp. contributing the most. But at the same time, concerns are mounting about the hundreds of billions of dollars Big Tech has pledged to spend on AI infrastructure. Capital expenditures from Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are expected to rise 34% to roughly $440 billion combined over the next year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Meanwhile, OpenAI has committed to spending more than $1 trillion on AI infrastructure, an eye-popping number for a closely held company that isn’t profitable. But perhaps even more troubling is the circular nature of many of its arrangements, in which investments and spending go back and forth between OpenAI and a few publicly traded tech giants. Throughout history, over-investment has been a common theme when there’s a technological advancement that will transform society, according to Invesco chief global market strategist Brian Levitt, who pointed to the development of railroads, electricity and the internet. This time may be no different. “At some point the infrastructure build may exceed what the economy will need over a short period of time,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean that the rail tracks weren’t finished or the internet didn’t become a thing, right?” Still, with equity valuations creeping up and the S&P 500 just posting its third straight year of double-digit percentage gains, it makes sense that investors are growing concerned about how much upside is left and how much market value could be lost if AI doesn’t live up to the hype. Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon.com, Broadcom and Meta Platforms account for almost 30% of the S&P 500, so an AI selloff would hit the index hard. “A bubble likely crashes on a bear market,” said Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at Cetera Financial Group, who doesn’t believe AI stocks are in a bubble. “We just don’t see a bear market anytime soon.” Here’s how today’s AI boom stacks up against previous market bubbles. One simple way of gaging whether the AI-fueled tech rally has gone too far or too fast is to compare it against past bull runs. Looking at 10 equity bubbles from around the world since 1900, they lasted just over two-and-a-half years on average with a trough-to-peak gain of 244%, according to research by Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett. By comparison, the AI-driven rally is in its third year, with the S&P 500 rising 79% since the end of 2022 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index gaining 130%. While it’s difficult to draw any conclusions from the data, Hartnett warns investors against fleeing the stock market even if they believe it’s in a bubble because the last stretch of the rally is typically the steepest, and missing out would be costly. One way to hedge is to buy cheap value plays like UK stocks and energy companies, he said. The S&P 500’s 10 biggest stocks now account for roughly 40% of the index, a level of concentration not seen since the 1960s. That has put some investors off, including Wall Street research veteran Ed Yardeni, who said in December that it no longer makes sense to recommend overweighting tech stocks. Market historians argue that, while the concentration seems extreme relative to recent memory, there are precedents. Top stocks as a share of the US market were at similar levels in the 1930s and 1960s, according to London Business School professor Paul Marsh, who studied the past 125 years of global asset returns. In 1900, 63% of US market value was tied to railroad stocks, compared with 37% tied to technology at the end of 2024, Marsh said. Asset bubbles tend to be much harder to spot in real time than after the fact because fundamentals are usually at the center of the debate, and the metrics investors focus on can be fluid, according to TS Lombard economist Dario Perkins. “It is easy for tech enthusiasts to claim that ‘it’s different now’ and that fundamental valuations will never be the same again,” he said. But some fundamentals are always important. For example, compared with the dot-com bubble, today’s AI giants have lower debt-to-earnings ratios than, say, WorldCom Inc. And companies like Nvidia and Meta Platforms are already reporting strong profit growth from AI, which wasn’t necessarily the case in the speculative era 25 years ago. The potential for credit risk in the AI trade is making some investors nervous. After Oracle Corp. sold $18 billion in bonds on Sept. 24, the stock plunged 5.6% the next day and it’s down 37% since then. Meta, Alphabet and Oracle will need to raise $86 billion combined in 2026 alone, according to an estimate by Societe Generale. The S&P 500’s valuation is the highest it’s ever been except for the early 2000s, at least according to its cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, a metric invented by economist Robert Shiller that divides a stock price by the average of its inflation-adjusted earnings over the past 10 years. Bullish investors argue that while market valuations are rising because of tech, the pace of increase is much slower than the dot-com era. At one point in 2000, Cisco Systems Inc. was priced at over 200 times its previous 12 months of earnings, while Nvidia is at less than 50 times today. Stock prices decouple from earnings growth in an environment where there’s no debate on valuations, according to Richard Clode, a fund manager at Janus Henderson. “We’re just not seeing that currently as yet,” he said. Discussions of a potential stock bubble percolated throughout the year but picked up significantly in November and December amid warnings from investor Michael Burry and the Bank of England. More than 12,000 stories in November mentioned the phrase “AI bubble,” roughly equal to the prior ten months combined, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors see an AI bubble as the biggest “tail risk” event, a December poll by Bank of America showed. More than half of the respondents said the Magnificent Seven tech stocks were Wall Street’s most crowded trade. This contrasts with the dot-com bubble, when there was “complete excitement about the internet revolutionizing everything,” said Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays. And the questions about whether AI investments will pay off are increasing as the debt issuance rises. “I wouldn’t brush it off, but I would generally think that scrutiny is healthy,” he said. “In fact, that scrutiny is what will prevent extreme moves like a crash.”

Title: Xreal releases new AR glasses and power hub to transform work and entertainment
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/04/xreal-releases-new-ar-glasses-power-hub-transform-work-entertainment/
Time Published: 2026-01-04T14:00:47Z

UPDATED 09:00 EST / JANUARY 04 2026 by Kyt Dotson Augmented reality device maker Xreal Inc. released the Xreal 1S today, a new premium pair of 3D spatial display glasses, and a compact power hub that combines a battery and video passthrough. The 1S joins the Xreal One Series, including the One and One Pro, providing a powerful foundation for wearable AR displays. The company said the 1S represents a new standard for AR displays and is a market replacement for the initial Xreal One, released in December 2024. 1S provides an immersive, cinema-grade experience with the ability to project a 171-inch spatial screen while building on core aspects of the One. It increases resolution from 1080p to 1200p FullHD, delivers brightness of 700 nits, and offers a larger field of view at 52 degrees. When moving between outdoors and indoors, the glasses can change their display settings using electrochromic dimming to adapt to lighting conditions. The glasses also feature Sound by Bose technology, eliminating the need for earbuds or headphones, and are capable of delivering high-fidelity audio directly near the ears. All of this is built into a lightweight 82-gram frame. Although this is heavier than the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, which weigh 49-51 grams, the S1 packs in numerous productivity and entertainment features. The Ray-Ban smart glasses also only project onto one lens, so they do not provide a 3D augmented reality display like the S1. For comparison, some regular sunglasses weigh about 45 grams, making these glasses feel heavier on the face. Users can place floating screens in their vision that “anchor in place” and do not move when they move their head, or they can generate an ultra-large cinema screen that will stay in front of their vision at all times. For productivity, “side view” allows pinning a smaller screen to a corner of vision, such as the top-right or bottom-right, allowing users to multitask by watching content while seeing the real-world surroundings clearly. Available today, the Xreal 1S lowers the price from its predecessor, the Xreal One, from $499 to $449. That makes it more affordable for entry-level consumers. “Every Xreal One Series product has raised the bar for what wearable displays can achieve,” said co-founder and Chief Executive Chi Xu. “With Xreal 1S, we’re not only lowering the cost of entry, we’re doing so while boosting specs and performance, and improving optics.” In addition to the 1S, Xreal launched a power accessory called Neo, providing extended battery life for longer sessions. The Neo serves as a DisplayPort video hub with a 10,000 mAh power bank, eliminating the need for additional adapters or chargers. It supports 30-watt input and 20-watt output on battery and up to 45-watt output when connected to a wall charger. Beyond battery life, the Neo permits higher video performance gains when streaming from other devices. It also unlocks the ability to connect to the Nintendo Switch handheld, without the need for the previously required dock. Xreal 1S users can experience the Nintendo Inc. Switch’s onboard screen at 1080p resolutions. Valve Corp. SteamDeck owners can receive up to 1200p resolution. “Xreal 1S brings true cinema-quality spatial displays to more people than ever before, while Xreal Neo redefines what’s possible in portable AR by solving one of the industry’s biggest limitations – power and performance on the go,” said Xu.

I was about to write the similar comment. I had to click just to see what this is about. Since the clickbait worked, maybe it will start some garbled title trend. Boy Howdy! That’s 4 minutes of my life completely shot to hell… I don’t understand why UnHerd asked a Columbia University student to write a column. Pretty sure the pandas are AI. Here are some photos of real bears from National Geographic: https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/giant-baby-panda-cubs-china-conservation I immediately had the same impression — AI-generated, or CGI. The page where this image originates is full of similarly-themed and obviously CGI/AI generated pictures, and the site hosting it, stockcake.com, touts “Millions of free AI stock photos”, and “Sign up to use AI-powered tools — Join 300,000+ creators • Free forever • No credit card required”. That term ‘creators’ is a bit of a stretch. All they did was to take other people’s work and used a computer to bodgy up their own version which puts the real, original creators out of work. And people wonder why I despise Silicon Valley culture. The hosting site is totally open about it. Witness: “Recreate this image — Sign up to generate variations — 50 free credits daily — Commercial license included — No credit card required” Respectively: “Apply stunning effects — Sign up to use AI tools on this image…” The well of artistic creation is truly and hopelessly poisoned. A post by a sort-of respected medical researcher on twitter had an AI-generated image and someone replied that it would be better to not use this stuff. The researcher (what a nerve) told the replier to make an image for him if they didn’t like the AI. Someone else replied “f off with your anti-AI propaganda”. Anti-AI propaganda? Where are people’s heads at, my god. Makes me wonder if the reply was generated by… wait for it….. an LLM AI Bot? I replaced the AI panda image with a real panda trio. Some pictures are too good to be true. The new photo is great, thanks. It’s a bear band lp cover photo. I think they play bluegrass. Thanks Haig. Much more pleasing to the eye <3 i watch broadcast TV via youtube. My suspicion is that 33 – 49% of youtube adverts are made via generative AI. Hollywood and NYC national broadcasters, as we know it, are dead men walking The handwriting has been on the wall since Max Headroom. “Live updates: Trump says US will ‘run’ Venezuela after Maduro capture” That’s going to be a neat trick. Does he plan on phoning in his orders? Will he send Venezuelan-Americans back in to run the country for him without the need for a messy election? Can’t be done without boots on the ground but is there an appetite to do so? Mark Sleboda on Danny Haiphong yesterday opined to the contrary, that the absence of defensive fire against dozens of helicopters and the orderly handover of Maduro by his guards to the Americans means the military was bought off in advance and in on the plot. He thinks there will be no problem maintaining order in the near term with threats and bribes. Haiphong also said the house of the defense minsiter was hit but he survived becuase he got to his bunker. The US took out a lot of the lights in Caracas before they went in and also hit airbases to take out air defenses. MANPADs require either initial visual targeting (the IR can then take over) or radar, so no lights would impede MANPAD use. More from the Financial Times: Experts in air assault said that the US air armada would have been able to suppress Venezuelan airspace defences using a variety of electronic and kinetic attacks, from spoofing GPS timing and jamming communications to turning off early warning and targeting radar. This meant that the Blackhawk and Chinook helicopters seen flying low over the skyline of Caracas were “in little danger until they reached the fortress”, said Andrew Turner, a former Royal Air Force helicopter pilot. “The ingress and egress from the Iwo Jima to the target would have been the easy part,” said Turner. “The most dangerous time is the 60-90 seconds as you are approaching and are on the target when you don’t have the full picture, bullets are going everywhere and you have yet to secure the area. That is where the danger is.” And Kutilya the Contemplator: It must be noted here that the fact that US helicopters entered Caracas, seized Maduro and exited without any significant resistance does not demonstrate Venezuelan military acquiescence or institutional weakness. It more plausibly reflects temporary denial of response at the apex of command – confusion, withheld authorization, selective stand-downs by a narrow set of gatekeepers or deliberate restraint to avoid catastrophic escalation against overwhelming US force. Modern, politicized militaries do not automatically fire under conditions of uncertainty. They calculate institutional survival. Thus, if inducements or coercion occurred, they needed only to neutralize air-defense commanders and presidential guard leadership, not the entire force. A clean extraction therefore signals elite fracture and risk aversion in the moment, not acceptance of foreign custodianship. Indeed, militaries humiliated without being destroyed often shift toward delayed, asymmetric and deniable resistance, making the absence of immediate kinetic response a warning sign rather than reassurance for Washington. https://chandragupta.substack.com/p/decapitation-without-destruction So this is not proven. People want tidy explanations when a lot is still not very well known. Yes. To be honest, this is what I would have expected from a military without recent combat experience, subject to an attack that was a complete tactical surprise, carefully prepared and with an overwhelming capability advantage. Against a large-scale conventional attack, they would probably have done quite a lot better, because they would have had more time, but you have to anticipate, plan for and train for a limited and targeted attack of this kind, which it’s clear the Venezuelans were not expecting. Any such attack achieves most of its effect from surprise and it seems surprise here was total. That said, it’s not clear to me that the US has gained a great deal except in PR terms. There is no reason to suppose that the new government (same as the old government, effectively) will do what the US wants, nor that the US is prepared to actually try to invade the country. to make it do so. I’ve been reading that Maduro was guarded by Wagner mercenaries, which makes me wonder. This would be a stain on their record if they got rolled with barely landing any punches of their own. I suspect they just provided his personal protection against assassinations, conventional kidnapping attempts etc: things like vehicle escort, manning security barriers, and the like.They would not have been expecting something like this, nor equipped to deal with it. Venezuela was up against the might of the western colonial empire. And in the fine British tradition of never believe anything until it has been officially denied, I would say the UK was definitely involved “British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his country was not involved in the United States’ strikes on Venezuela” from Al-Jazeera. So this was probably US muscle + UK colonial rule tactics + Israeli electronic warfare. The US attack was not a bolt from the blue. Venezuela had been facing an obvious enemy buildup on their doorstep for many weeks. Everybody knows that “decapitation” is part of US and Israeli doctrine–virtually SOP. In any case, enemy attack on one’s command-and-control is always to be expected in war. Recent examples: Israelis killing Nasrallah. Russian SF tried to nab Zelensky at the beginning of the Ukraine war. Even if we disregard the risk of capture, Maduro should still have already been in a HQ bunker, or making frequent moves, simply because of the risk of an air strike, made by an enemy known to have stealth aircraft and advanced ECM. Now think about just how good the US intelligence had to be, to conduct the kidnap–how accurate, how timely the information they needed. On this basis alone, treachery would be a reasonable hypothesis. From the videos I’ve seen, some helicopters were plainly visible. Fair targets for old fashioned ack-ack, let alone MANPADS. Whatever details emerge, I assume Venezuela will take this as a wake up call, time to diversify small arms storage. The Grayzone podcast yesterday by Max Blumenthal and Anya Parampil was interesting on this issue. Both are very familiar with the Venezuela situation and have relevant contacts there and in DC. While they were careful in their comments, they strongly implied that there had been negotiations behind the scenes in the preceding weeks toward just this outcome. They didn’t say it quite this directly, but my interpretation was that Maduro was given the choice to leave voluntarily and would not, so the “choice” was made for him (actually Parampil did state this as a possible scenario). They did not directly accuse Delcy Rodríguez or others in Maduro’s administration of complicity, but they did point out that for some reason the Trump administration seems willing to deal with them, at least temporarily, and noted Trump’s rather brutal dismissal of Machado in his press conference. And while they kind of danced around this, they did raise questions about the relative ease with which the kidnapping took place. For those interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTgkGSeJfhg Fwiw, there is something analogous between MAGAism and Bolivarianismo, in the sense of riling up disaffected masses against established elites. However, I doubt socio-cultural affinity probably doesn’t mean much to Trump (I personally thought Maduro was more a “jobber” than a real believer, which Rodriguez seemed to be–then again, that’d make her more like MTG whom Trumpuro hates…) I suspect that the reason that Trump dissed Machao was because she “took” his Nobel Peace Prize when clearly it should have belonged to him. From A Martyanov: “I know, it is going to be hurtful to many but they don’t call those countries banana republics for nothing, banana republic being a euphemism for corrupt regimes and toy armies. Some news (from there)–the chief of Maduro’s security detail as well as a number of others have been bought by the US. In fact, there was a Russian military group which rushed to Maduro residence but it was held off by the fire of … yep, Maduro security people. By the time Russians dealt with those traitors, Maduro was already gone. The chief of security detail has been caught and was executed already. So, this is update for you.” Polar Scientist was commenting yesterday that there was fire exchange and that US group left under fire. if wagner were anywhere near this fight you know we’d be seeing pix on US .mil social media of some roided-out JSOC beardo showing off his RUS ghanima. they either never existed or weren’t trusted by maduro not to be bought off (never trust a merc with your life) And another question: will the billion dollar a day fleet off the Venezuelan coast now go home? As to the question of whether Trump knows what he is doing we all know the answer. Antiwar site says that 40 people were killed from the raid’s bombing and some American troops may have been injured. MOA says among the bomb targets was Chavez’ mausoleum. Classy. At any rate the attack’s true purpose–throw a small country against the wall to show who’s boss– has likely been accomplished. That this brilliant idea never seems to work will be ignored by Trump as he builds his arch of triumph to himself in DC. No doubt it will include a bas relief of Maduro in handcuffs. I just saw Douglas Macgregor on Judge Napolitano. He thinks not, or at least not all of them. The US has ~15,000 tropps which he thinks will be committed, as Trump indicated (he talked about boots on the ground), presumably to do things like secure key government installations and protect oil assets. They will require logistical support. If Trump tries, those troops will be stretched thin. The accepted ration for an occupation is twenty troops for every 1,000 population. And Venezuela has a population of about 30 million. So will there be a Green Zone in Caracas then? I suspect, admittedly on very limited information, that if President Trump is foolish enough to send in only the 15,000, that they believe their own propaganda and/or that they have a deal with what they believe are the current ruling Venezuela elites. Kidnapping a country’s leader especially without a declaration of war under criminal charges that the attacking country’s leader could be indicted under seems like a good way to guarantee a hot war; there are always some angry men willing to take revenge.

Interesting bit on Rodriguez from the AP: Strong ties with Wall Street A lawyer educated in Britain and France, Rodríguez has a long history of representing the revolution started by the late Hugo Chávez on the world stage. She and her brother, Jorge Rodríguez, head of the Maduro-controlled National Assembly, have sterling leftist credentials born from tragedy. Their father was a socialist leader who died in police custody in the 1970s, a crime that shook many activists of the era, including a young Maduro. Unlike many in Maduro’s inner circle, the Rodríguez siblings have avoided criminal indictment in the U.S. Delcy Rodríguez developed strong ties with Republicans in the oil industry and on Wall Street who balked at the notion of U.S.-led regime change. Among her past interlocutors were Blackwater founder Erik Prince and, more recently, Richard Grenell, a Trump special envoy who tried to negotiate a deal with Maduro for greater U.S. influence in Venezuela. Fluent in English, Rodríguez is sometimes portrayed as a well-educated, market-friendly moderate in contrast to the military hard-liners who took up arms with Chávez against Venezuela’s democratically elected president in the 1990s. https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-trump-maduro-military-rodriguez-lead-c0bd39f98a79c18c5501bac939c640fe# “Trump admin sends tough private message to oil companies on Venezuela” I can understand the reluctance of the oil companies. Trump is expecting them to invest huge amounts of capital to rebuild Venezuela’s oil infrastructure as well as starting to convert plants in the US to once more handle the heavy crudes that they use to process. And this effort will effort will take many years and is assuming that there is no resistance in Venezuela to them pumping that oil to send to the US while paying Venezuela only a pittance. Say that it will take five years which may prove optimistic. What will this country be like by 2031? Which party will be running the US by then? Why is Trump not offering any guarantees but lumbering all the costs onto them? If I was running an oil company, I would be extremely lurky about getting too much involved and spending too much capital on such a dynamic situation. I certainly be not depending on a Trump promise. What a framing but, I think Trump is offering protection money/troops/mercs to the oil companies and a reimbusement to big oil investments through these government supports. Sort of like the old protection rackets — I am offering protection in exchange for some money…wouldn’t want anything bad to happen..if you know what I mean. the below quote could be used about Gaza and Venezuela “Venezuela would be a crown jewel if the above-ground risk is removed. I have companies saying let’s see where this lands,” said Derentz “above-ground risk is removed” pesky humans That kinda sounds like he wants to establish a “security zone” around those oil fields where there will be no people, towns or villages allowed. Kinda like the Israeli method. No doubt they will get some merc corporations to provide all the security in and around there with drones being used as well. Oil field workers may be forced to live in some sort of policed towns in this security zone and only allowed out on weekend leave or the like. If this is so, then they must be really worried about sabotage there. So would I. Well one thing we know for sure, whatever policy put in place by Trump-as it pertains to Venezuela-will be left as is should a Dem administration take over in 2028. Iraq being the Cheney Oily-Man symposium on , “We used to, and that’s why we don’t any more…” Also, given the global trend favoring renewables over fossil fuels as evidenced by shifting market shares (Our World in Data) favoring the former, this might give oil companies pause when it comes to costly, long term investments, and particularly so if the locals are hostile. ‘Science girl @sciencegirl A Shaolin kung fu master shows how it’s done.’ If it weren’t for the clothes that they were wearing, somebody should have told them to put their rulers away and zip up again.

The photo is interesting and I’m curious what other readers think. Madero is shown with hands cuffed in front giving two thumbs up while surrounded by DEA agents. That is an interesting photo that. Those DEA agents tried to make it a ‘trophy’ shot but Maduro giving both thumbs up spoiled the whole thing for them. Maduro was previously negotiating. Here are some what-ifs. He wanted safe passage to pick-a-country. He got some assurances about personal safety for his family. The next shoe to drop will be revelations about the Venezuelan role in election machines. They do have form. >The United States Captures Nicolás Maduro and his Wife In his appeal, Noriega argued that his arrest violated international law under the head-of-state immunity doctrine. The district court rejected Noriega’s head-of-state immunity claim because the United States government never recognized Noriega as Panama’s legitimate ruler — an argument that will be made in the Maduro prosecution. Can China lawfully detain and try Taiwan’s president under Chinese law just because it doesn’t recognize his legitimacy? Seems to me that the arrest of a Taiwanese president under PRC law could be much easier argued as legal given that Taiwan is not actually officially recognized as an independent nation by the vast majority of the world. Netanyahu is an international criminal guilty of plausible genocide by the ICJ. Were he kidnapped and brought to the Hague, and imprisoned, or kidnapped by another country to stand trial, I doubt the US would tolerate it. As for Noriega, unlike Maduro, Noriega was an unelected dictator. The US charges against Maduro include drug smuggling and dealing in weapons, and if he were a US President doing these things as part of his office (which we know many have done) — if I read the recent SCOTUS decision correctly — he would be immune from prosecution. A US president may be immune from a US prosecution, but he is now subject to jurisdiction from just about anyone in the world under their laws who care not one bit about SCOTUS. Top 5 African countries with the best quality of life index at the start of 2026 Business Insider Africa This made me think of Gaddafi. Maybe this index is how the great USA chooses the African country that needs destruction the most. Unlike Libya, none of the five countries mentioned are particularly resource-rich, and all depend partly on tourism. Libya is a good example of the old rule that you can only bribe the population with resource revenues, up to a certain point, no matter how repressive your security apparatus is. It’s a story that’s played out many times in Africa and the Middle East, and will again, no doubt. I thought that list was kind of odd. I’ve been to West Africa more than a handful of times for both work and visiting friends and Senegal, Ivory Coast and at the limit, Guinea-Bissau, are livable countries with tons of potential. I’ve also been to South Africa plenty – though not in the last 10 years – and while it has higher levels of economic development at the very top, it seemed to me not a place for the kind of people who can’t deal with constant situational awareness. Egypt is the real outlier there. The cities need a heck of a lot of infrastructure care. Gaddafi is also a good example of the old rule that you can only remain in power so long as you don’t threaten the economies of larger countries’ economies, imo. See his interest in selling oil for currencies other than US dollars. I don’t think those who rose up against him in 2011 were particularly worried about that. Little brown people who don’t speak English have agency too, you know. In any case Gaddafi was very popular internationally after 2004 as an ally in the War on Terror without the tiresome scruples of western states, and it was only when he was clearly going down that the West piled in, hoping to be on good terms with whoever replaced him. The CIA and M-I6 are very very good at… um… ‘guiding’ the people and events in foreign countries. See: color revolutions. See Hillary “we came, we saw, he died” Clinton. / ;) Pretty sure those “little brown people who don’t speak English” did not, for example, bomb their own county’s irrigation infrastructure all by themselves and very likely did not wish it to happen – https://theecologist.org/2015/may/14/war-crime-nato-deliberately-destroyed-libyas-water-infrastructure It’s funny how self-destructive behavior of little non-white non-English-speaking people perfectly matches neocolonial desires of bigwig white English-speaking gentlemen, not to mention military efforts of NATO countries. The Lord indeed works in mysterious ways. He was by no means “clearly going down” until after the west piled on. – ‘The United States Captures Nicolás Maduro and his Wife’ – Jonathan Turley I commented on this yesterday, but as I re-read this I find I’m much more irritated today. Turley lays out the defense he thinks Maduro will use based on the earlier Manuel Noriega case . He defends the “legality” of the Trump administration’s kidnapping though some dubious Obama whataboutism (which I guess is “precedent” here), and explains why Maduro’s defense will fail as did Noriega’s. As he notes, much of this earlier failure, in a “legal” sense, was simply due to the State’s insistence that Noriega was not a legitimate head of state, just a common drug trafficker. The Court just accepted this bulls**t claim. Turley has the audacity to pretend that the preordained verdict was a matter of law! But then he goes further and says this in his conclusion: “Legally, Trump has the upper hand in this case. Maduro will replay the arguments from the Noriega case. However, he presents an even weaker case on the merits under the controlling precedent than did Noriega.” Noriega was a notorious drug trafficker whose actions were abetted by the US when he was helping us support the Contras against Nicaragua. But he knew where a lot of skeletons were buried (figuratively and literally) and so was legally “disappeared” when he became a little too “independent.” Maduro’s case was *nothing* like this, and whatever corruption took place during his regime (and I’m sure it was there, so there will be “evidence” of some kind), these charges are ridiculously “trumped” up. Everyone knows this. For Turley to pretend that The Law matters at all here simply reinforces the despicable administration framing. A YouTuber (Judge Nap?) said the case was filed under Trump 1.0 but not pursued under Biden because they could not prove it. Turley ignores the factual allegations, that it depicts Maduro as the head of some named cartel (forgive me for not searching for it) which Larry Johnson has repeatedly dismissed as a fabrication. Turley, the very self righteous law “absolutist,” has a flexible view when the law is bent by Republicans. He seemed refreshing when we were suffering under Biden and the opposite now that the supposedly victimized conservatives are back in charge. Meanwhile Simplicus suggests that the entire operation was theater in which Maduro cooperated since a deal has been worked out for him and his family to take a plea or be let go–another way of making him disappear. This is mere speculation of course. So how long until we just dismiss Turley as a right-wing shill? wasn’t that about twenty years ago? If so, and regardless, a lot of people, “little people” for sure, were killed and injured in the process. The operation is despicable. Nothing more to add.

The strong will do as they will and the weak suffer what they must.* Overthrow the strong. *solidarity Instead: How do the many bring the clever onto their side? And then overthrow Capital Given the present trajectory, I expect Capital to “overthrow” itself. By focusing narrowly and almost exclusively on its own ‘private’ profit, Capital starves the public sector of resources with which to run, let alone expand social services. This directly effects the ability of “society” in general to support the Capitalist class in its endeavours. Late stage Capitalism can be best described as a Doom Loop in progress. What many “True Believers” forget is that Capitalism is a Teran human construct. It is not a “Natural Law,” or an aspect of physics. Terran humans being fallible beings, then so too are their creations. Capitalism may not think about the Jackpot, but the Jackpot thinks about Capitalism. I wonder who will be the Maduros’ lawyers. I would suggest the same team that represents Luigi Mangione. Turley disingenuously ignores the blatant illegality of the Maduro ‘arrest’ under international law. There is a critical distinction between “prescriptive”jurisdiction, under which a state may criminalize conduct outside its borders which has domestic effects, and “enforcement” jurisdiction, which forbids a state from exercising law enforcement actions (such as arrests) in the territory of another country without that country’s consent. That is the whole point of having extradition treaties. See Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States § 432(2) (sorry can’t link due to paywall); Ghappour, “Searching Places Unknown,” 69 Stanford Law Review 1075, 1100 (2017). 1. International law is irrelevant in US courts 2. Lawyers can correct me, but I also believe illegal arrests are not a defense to prosecution in the US either. If cops or prosecutors get information impermissibly (search w/o a warrant or consent, for instance), that information cannot be used in a prosecution. But my having watched too many vids by civil rights attorneys says you need to be found innocent of the criminal charges, and only then can you file a civil rights claim over the illegal arrest. With all due respect, I am a lawyer and a retired federal judge. Your statement that international law is irrelevant in federal courts is way too glib. True, the issue is complicated and has been the subject of intense debate since the 1990s, but there is little doubt that for most of our history the “Law of Nations” was regarded as part of the Supreme Law of the Land. https://tlblog.org/international-law-in-american-courts/ I offer no prediction on whether the illegality of the arrest will prove to be a get out of jail card for Maduro in this particular instance. I do know it is possible to challenge an illegal extradition by filing a federal habeas corpus petition. I handled several such cases when I was on the bench. secular americans, especially those in the industry, cling so tightly to “legality” as though there is some divine arbiter to whom the wronged could appeal. obviously this whole thing is an illegal farce, and equally obviously team snatch&grab doesn’t give a damn. if (mirabile dictu) he’s found innocent, will he be repatriated and reinstated? c’mon. several decades of abusing and neglecting the rule of law (under both parties) have rendered it a crumbling edifice at best and a transparent joke at worst.

As far as I know, that precedent still stands — and it was reaffirmed during Bush 2’s portion of the GWOT. Anthony Lukas’s book, Big Trouble; A Murder In A Small Western Town Sets Off A Struggle For The Soul Of America tells the story.

For many years now a lot of States require people that are employed by them to sign contracts which include the proviso that they are not allowed to do stuff like boycott Israel. I personally would say that this was in direct contravention of the US First Amendment but State and Federal governments – of both parties – were cool with it so what do I know. Thing is, with the Trump regime in charge right now, Trump might decide that this is a fine idea that would please his buddy Bibi and start doing it. Re cars as spybots–lest readers get too panicky about this I believe even Teslas require owner consent (perhaps it’s an opt out) for the car to continuously phone home to mother via cell towers. On ICE cars like mine you have to subscribe to an Onstar like service that is supposed to automatically call for help in case of as accident or emergency. The linked article says that cell supplied navigation services–on that dash screen– also give the car company continuous access to the computer inside your car. However the car is still recording data even if offline so if you take it to the dealer for service (or if right to repair advocates have their way any repair shop) then the record of your travels can be recovered. So I use my own GPS navigator (not smartphone based), don’t subscribe to the manufacturer’s services and have yet to take it to the dealer since I change my own oil. Some among the paranoid even disable the “head unit”–that center dash box that contains the various radios–to make sure the car isn’t talking to the spooks but that’s probably going too far. Simply refusing to cooperate in your own privacy invasion is probably enough. Happy to be informed otherwise by those more in the know. you have to subscribe to an Onstar like service that is supposed to automatically call I don’t think that’s as strong an argument as you think it is. If you can subscribe, that means the capability to do whatever is still there in the background. The subscription only means you’re paying for them to provide a service. If you were to subscribe, chances are almost certain that you wouldn’t have to take it in to the dealer to ‘turn it on’…. that would cost too much for them and be a very big negative effect on conversion rates. The car is talking to home, just not telling you. Back in the summer of ‘21 I was advised by my Sudbury dealer that my brand new Impreza would constantly be collecting driving data. He told me that this data would be used in a court of law were it necessary. This whether or not I subscribed to onstar. “Well, here’s another nice mess you’ve gotten me into!” Oliver Hardy to Stan Laurel. We do not and cannot know the nature and extent of the “nice mess” that Donnie and Marco have gotten us into. It was all so simple neat and clean.

We win 40-0. God, I love a shut out. What next? Donnie says we will control Venezuela until … all I remember is mumble mumble transition. Marco and Pete will be in charge. Nice move Donnie. They take the fall if, when, it blows up. Your finger already knows which direction to point. Wait a minute. When it blows up? Pretty pessimistic or are you some sort of Trump hater? You do refer to him as Donnie, not respectful. No, not respectful and here’s why. The snatch was neat and clean. Maybe the fix was in, but it plays well. What’s next? A plan or play it by ear? Based on past events my guess is play it by ear. Won’t cost us, he said. The oil will pay for it, he said. Wasn’t the oil going to pay for the Iraq invasion? Seems Venezuela is supposed to roll,over and submit. If not. what is your plan? Who protects the oil companies rebuilding the oil infrastructure? US troops? Mercenaries … those guys are expensive. You snatched Maduro. Two can play that game. Yeah, I know. The US is the big dog this close to home, but it is a “nice mess” until proven otherwise and I have no faith in that. https://x.com/RepMTG/status/2007485346913607836 💯👍 Thanks. Every usian should read this. She is still placing the blame on the other. Conservatives just are not capable of anything else. F#$% her. Sure, but presently she’s a critical part of the architecture attempting to split “America Firsters” from Trump’s support base, and push back on our “ironclad” support for ISR. Gut feeling is the, nonZio faction will be liquidated and with relative ease. I mean they are mocked online, but who is still in charge. Disagree with the easy part. Time will tell, one way or the other. I don’t think genZ is buying what bibi is selling. File under wild speculation…. / ;) Both Isr and Kingdom Saudi Arabia (KSA) share several interests. Both want the Yemeni military threats to their govts eliminated. Both want the Yemeni threat to the Gulf of Aden passage past the Horn of Africa* eliminated. (See the courting of Somalia Land by Isr.) Both have common enemies in Yemen, Iraq, and Iran. Both are currently interested in keeping the majority of the world’s oil reserves under the current arrangement of financial control of the US/West. Which brings me to Venezuela. Much has been made about Isr’s possible interest in the attack. Nothing has been said about KSA’s possible interest in seeing an oil competitor brought under control by the US. And… going way out here… nothing has been said about the T family’s immense financial dealings with KSA. Think of Jared Kushner managing the KSA sovereign wealth fund in the US. * map: http://www.geographicguide.net/africa/images/horn-africa.jpg / end wild speculations. / ;) Venezuela’s crude is a very different type of oil–heavy–and so not directly competitive with that from KSA. thanks. That’s motive, not innocence. To run a refinery requires a mix of crude. If you only have light crude like the Gulf, you cannot make heavier crack products…. I won’t even presume to know exactly what’s going on in Venezuela, especially with so much noise in the ether. Apparently half of the attacks people initially reported (like on the tomb of Chavez) weren’t even real? But I think there’s one crucial question that I haven’t seen much reporting on: is the government mobilizing the popular militias or not? Besides Yves’ one report yesterday and an article on Telesur (but not at the top), I haven’t heard much either way. If there is a popular mobilization though and if Venezuela is analogous to the revolutionary trajectory of Iran, China, or Russia, then it’s possible Trump just unintentionally gave PSUV the opening to start a Cultural Revolution (which wouldn’t contradict a backroom deal to “purge” Maduro by American black helicopters). Like I’ve said before, I don’t claim to know Venezuela or South America as well as other countries, so I mainly fall back onto comparative methods. And I recognize it might not be any more precise or scientific than astrology. The collapse of Assad in Syria surprised me though partly because I didn’t take that approach so I’m just putting it out there. This former CIA says Venezuela is nothing like Cuba the revolutionary fervor is just not there. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=helSwCCGwvQ CIA Analyst EXPOSES Plan A & B for Venezuela | Ron Aledo Neutrality Studies I’ll have to watch the video later, but again, another reason I bring up the comparative method is it challenges what may seem like the most natural model at first. For example, if there’s any validity to what I’m suggesting, the analogy isn’t Venezuela ~ Cuba, but more like Venezuela ~ China while Cuba ~ North Korea. Cuba has become a uniquely hardened society with an idiosyncratic system, even if it’s clearly an ally and the ideology is superficially like Venezuela’s. Venezuela OTOH has become more of a dynamic project, where factions are going to act out different trends over time. Again, it could all be woo-woo and pareidolia, but if there’s something to it and the initial analogy is sound, the clock would be somewhere around the Cultural Revolution in the Chinese context. Also the era of Basiji reactivation in Iran and Stalinist purges in the USSR. The main uncertainty is at what point do you start the clock from: Chavez’ first election, the 2009 referendum, or something else? Because that could mean it’s either at the beginning or the end; whether the popular militias stand down or rise up over the coming weeks and months sort of answers that. Either way, I could be wrong, but I currently don’t believe this represents a successful soft coup by the US. For one, all analysis and reporting from that angle starts from either taking everything Trump says as true or a sort of depressed “resistance is futile” worldview (which I’ve said before is just really a more resentful form of TINA). And if the analogy holds, even if some high-ranking officials or generals were bought, those are usually some of the very people that get purged in periods like this. Keep in mind that the Venezuelan people have been in a hyperinflationary economy for 42 years since Black Friday* in 1983, with the current rate of exchange something like 30,000 Bolivars to the buck. This is the same situation that we fell into with Ecuador when their economy was hyperinflating around the turn of the century and we jumped in and dollarized the place, along with all of its oil reserves. To put things in mad perspective, a 1964 or earlier silver Quarter has around $13 worth of silver in content at current rates, a similar coin, a 1965 Venezuela silver Bolivar is worth around 400,000,000 Bolivars after you go through all of the new and improved Bolivars that weren’t all that. That would be the easiest sell to the Venezuelan people, financial stability vis a vis a greenback economy. * my brother in law’s sister was an elementary school teacher in Atlanta in the late 1970’s and Venezuela offered her double what she was making in the states, and then Black Friday comes along and within a month she’s making 1/4 of what she could make in the states-exit stage north. I was there briefly before Chavez came to power 92-93. The poverty was gross to say the least. Literally people without lower limbs leading protests. If they start to revert to that i would assume that they will swing back more in the Bolivarian direction, but that will take time. Apparently half of the attacks people initially reported (like on the tomb of Chavez) weren’t even real? It’s the same playbook we saw with the Israeli surprise attack on Iran, just straight up BS being spewed out by the Western media mouthpieces to sow confusion. It might even literally be the same people doing the co-ordinating, or however these “reporter” scum get their blob marching orders. The Israelification of America in real time. Some of the headlines I was reading yesterday were just straight unfiltered bullshit: Venezuela vice president Rodriguez in Russia, four sources say Thanks, Reuters! Really keeping their audience informed aren’t they? FOUR whole sources supposedly too. And then via Reuters you get the same crap spewed everywhere else, eg: Venezuelan Vice President May Be in Russia: Report Western English media reporting at this point is a sewer wherever one cares to look, eg: US and Israel ‘planted’ media leaks alleging tensions before Iran attack: Report re: ‘Remove the top’: Grok AI floods with sexualized images of women – The American Bazaar One little understood or appreciated reason for the incredible increases in computer video cards improvements in refresh speed, color rendering, animation, detail, etc was/is the demand from the online pron industry. (It wasn’t driven by online gaming nearly as much as by online pron back then.) People interested in that wanted better video cards for their home computers than one needed to display simple data charts, graphs, maps, home digital pictures, or playing Super Mario Brothers, etc. The money pouring into accelerating video development for the home computer came in large measure from the ‘naughty’ market user demands back in the day. I’m not at all surprised by this Grok AI story. / ;) Shorter: some people were willing to pay much higher prices for an improved video card to get the video quality they wanted. Those much higher prices paid for better cards drove development faster than it might otherwise have developed. I remember reading years ago that the initial “profit driver” for new communications technologies is usually “representations of people making the beast with two backs.” This applies to print, photography, electronic audio and video, film, etc. etc. Remember ‘bootleg’ vinyl records of “blue joke” comics? I had a Moms Mably record once until my Mom found it. Photo cards of “poses plastiques?” ‘Girly’ magazines would come in plain brown paper wrappers, etc. etc. The infamous remark that no one ever went bankrupt underestimating the intelligence of the public also applies to morals. The underlying evil of Po—graphy is that it directly enables the sexual exploitation of the weak and the desperate. Stay safe. A little more by writer who lives there. https://www.counterpunch.org/2026/01/03/report-from-caracas-the-us-kidnaps-president-nicolas-maduro-but-venezuela-fights-back-and-maintains-its-revolution/ This from smoothie story. In fact, there was a Russian military group which rushed to Maduro residence but it was held off by the fire of … yep, Maduro security people. By the time Russians dealt with those traitors, Maduro was already gone. The chief of security detail has been caught and was executed already. So, this is update for you. No Making Shit Up. The Counterpoint piece does not say that and you have no source for your last para. Martyanov just dropped his talk with Garland. I have yet to check. But usually Martyanov is not making up things like this one. It´s obviously an issue: How come this all happen with RU arms and above all personnel on the ground? The above Martyanov quote is on his page fwiw https://smoothiex12.blogspot.com/2026/01/reaupload-with-new.html For what it’s worth, Venezuelanalysis confirms from their sources that 15 members of Maduro’s security detachment died (“were assassinated”) during the invasion. The source, I believe, is Andrey Martyanov’s blog (smoothiex12.blogspot.com) – word for word. As Martyanov is both quite well connected and prone to some “patriotic over-excitement” more than a grain of salt is warranted and yet it may be true-ish… Beyond that quote Martyanov´s usual chauvinism – (thanks to Yves for bringing back into discussion that word which as of late has completely vanished from the spaces that I read mostly pushed away by that awful “toxic” term) – in lieu of genuine insight on Venezuela and South America is of rather little help. So as of now it seems Russian unit when rushing to protect Maduro ran into none other than Maduro´s own guards. There apparently was a stand-off. And when Russians had “finished off ” those they came in too late. Also S-300/400 apparently were turned off. (how that worked with RUs possibly in charge? I don´t know. That´d possibly be the scene in a movie…) To equal the Venezuelan blunder with Syria or Iraq is superficial and uninformed in a way he is informed about his very own field of expertise where he is – overaly “exact” – which I cherish because he is professional. But since to his own regret he is not only commenting on military affairs re: Russia but also geopolitics he might wanna step back from some comments. Since even geopolitics is no science there you do need knowledge. It´s not as if he didn´t point out his shortcomings stating several times, he is no specialist on South America at all – but then his boastful verbage is thwarting the admission the next moment. The fact that 3rd World countries are “structurally weak” is not due to their cultural peculiarities. Which is why comparing the surrender of the Iraqi Army with a Mossadegh or Venezuela now is totally out of place. Garland actually has the more interesting quips. Both agree that Venezuela as a new target is basically admitting defeat and signals eventual retreat of the US from Ukraine. Martyanov is also hinting at setting a precedent now might well again come back the way Serbia 1999 and Kosovo 2008 boomeranged in form of Crimea 2014 and SMO now. Despite the flaws I addressed worth the 45 minutes: https://smoothiex12.blogspot.com/2026/01/garland-and-me.html Martyanov´s latest own podcast I have not yet watched: https://smoothiex12.blogspot.com/2026/01/reaupload-with-new.html p.s. Again I feel reminded by all this of Conrad´s undervalued adventure novel “NOSTROMO”. Garland brings up a funny idea but the truth behind it is essential: If Trump were to seize control over Greenland would the Europeans oppose? Of course not. Because they´re powerless. On this note one could argue, Europe is lucky not to be very rich of natural resources the US really needs. Otherwise the insane things happening here would provide material for the next decade of Hollywood flicks and high-octane action-thriller streaming content. Like French and German troops fighting US forces. I would be more concerned about the Greenlanders and Denmark recognising a double coincidence of interests with Russia and China. Re: p. s. A British TV film based on the novel is on Youtube in two parts. Excellent cast too. Youtube link to first part: https://youtu.be/EIM9vo73jjI HAHAHAHAHAHA!!! excellent thank you. This is like “I told you so” from Conrad looking down onto us right now. The intro could be used as a commentary from the editorial pages of a daily this very week. It´s time to adapt the novel again. https://smoothiex12.blogspot.com/2026/01/reaupload-with-new.html Here Santa Clara/San Jose has an interesting heritage. It was the center for the “Copperheads” or Confederate sympathizers during the American Civil War, a stronghold of the Klan in the 20’s and 30’s (Along with Contra Costa County) and during the 60’s the militant wing of the John Birch society ,the “Minutemen” had their California headquarters there. Peter Thiel and the Tech Bros fit right in Anti-Aging Injection Regrows Knee Cartilage and Prevents Arthritis SciTech Daily ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Sounds great, where do I sign up to be a crash test dummy? Put in a whole 7 miles on the trails in Mineral King this summer thanks to my ailing knee, normally it’d be around 150 miles. Skied once this year and it didn’t feel too bad, as you aren’t really moving your legs all that much when skiing down a mountain, its more hip swiveling than anything else, and relying on gravity. Remember Jet Stix? I had a pair. Never had those, but I had Burt bindings for a brief time~ https://unofficialnetworks.com/2024/04/30/most-dangerous-ski-binding-ever-produced/ I’m glad I never had those, lol. We had those leather safety straps at first, the ones that were hard to work with cold fingers. I’m curious how the trial goes. In the assault with a deadly sandwich case and the Comey and Letitia James cases the Trump DOJ has hardly covered itself in glory. One big difference between Maduro and Noriega is that the latter was actually running drugs, even if for the CIA, I have yet to see any compelling evidence that Maduro was doing the same. My understanding is that while no friends of Maduro the Biden DOJ thought the indictment against him put out by the first Trump admin was very weak tea and were not interested in pursuing it. What happens if a jury finds Maduro and his wife not guilty? The Trump admin certainly has shown a penchant for going ready, fire, aim on policy. >The 2025 Housing Affordability Crisis in Charts: What Changed and What Didn’t Investopedia From the article: “Gen Zers and young families will feel the pinch of still-high costs, with many of them opting for nontraditional living situations to afford housing…” I vote for “nontraditional living situations” as The Euphemism of 2026. What an anodyne way to describe four people in a one-bedroom apartment, 30-year-olds in their parents’ basement, life in a camper van or RV or a tent in a park, a habitation under a bridge. Almost makes them sound desirable, an alternative to normal living: ‘Will that be traditional or non-traditional, sir?” “I’ll take the non-traditional. I’m a bohemian poet. Give me the garret on the sixth-floor.” I think most Gen Zers would describe their housing situation in words other than “nontraditional”. Like hopeless, depressing, humiliating. But this does not detract from the clever wording of the article which obscures the fact that most young people today, to put it in the plain words not used by the article, cannot find a decent place to live at a decent price. For my 20 year old nephews in San Diego, its an impossible dream acquiring an American Dream now at a million bucks. It would have been $100k when I was their age… Their only hope is via inheritance~ I just ran across a link at NDTV[? do not know of their reliability]: NASA’s Largest Library To Permanently Close On Jan 2, Books Will Be ‘Tossed Away’ https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/nasas-largest-library-to-permanently-close-on-jan-2-books-will-be-tossed-away-10170584 “NASA’s largest library at the Goddard Space Flight Center will close permanently on Jan 2 under the Trump administration’s reorganisation plans.” This is appalling if true. I saw similar library closings and dumpsters full of bound journals and techical books when Bell Labs shut down their Whippany library. I did not see it but heard a similar closure and discarding of books and journals occurred when the Holmdel library was closed. Many of the books dated from the 1960s and almost all were nearly irreplaceable to say nothing of what they could cost. The Bell Labs Whippany library closure took place in the early 1990s and though there were many advances since the 1960s those 1990s advances built upon knowledge from before often best described and explained in the books from the 1960s, 1970s, and some books from the 1980s. Trump’s America is well on its way toward reviving a new know-nothing party to serve a country of know-nothings. It just hurts my heart to see what is happening to our country. I can’t understand how anyone would cheer for this. The people enabling this are basically stupid “smart” people. It is time for an American Cultural Revolution. (The damage is already being done to “ordinary” people. Now the task is to ‘share’ the pain with the so called “Upper Crust.”) That’s gunna put a big spanner into space research by people. Their suggestion is to look on the net or or use the inter-library loan service from other federal agencies – who will unlikely have such specialized books. Maybe they should ask Musk if he wants the books from that library as his people would be able to use them. but NASA is being gutted. Thanks for this. Link to NYT article of same Goddard closure: https://archive.ph/uBZ8g Hard agree with @ambrit ITT. Way overdue. Mighty big of Elon, he’s offering free Starlink to all Venezuelans until February 3rd. Another true son of the Empire doing his part. Ha. OpenAI was offering double usage credits for their Codex coding LLM for like 3 days as a new year’s gift or something ridiculous, lol. Interesting. True. No mention of COVID, though, and the nearly 1.3 million deaths directly attributed to it, and those indirectly, like my father’s, must be causing a great deal of grief as well. If only society acknowledges it, might we be able to contend with the cause of it. We Are All in a Constant State of Grief (NY Times op ed) I often start and end my day in my mother’s garden. She died almost three years ago, of stomach cancer. The garden was sacred to her. While she was alive, I saw it as just a place to read on a lounge chair or duck out to for a smoke when I came back home to visit. Since her death, I’ve found myself drawn there. I feel closer to her when I am in the garden. I cannot claim to know the names of all the plants, shrubs and bushes, but I do my best to take care of them. It feels like taking care of her, as I had tried to do, right up to her last breath. I first noticed the preponderance of lawyer billboards in Phoenix about a dozen years ago on the freeways in town, and Las Vegas had even more of them, but you didn’t see so many in California compared to those locales, but that was then and this is now, and on my drive down to San Diego they carpet bombed billboards with their pleas for fees. What does this say about us as a society, where slimy lawyers (and casinos-the other player) are held to a higher standard of about 25 feet up? why post that AI image of a pandas? Interesting information on Danny Haiphong’s YT channel w/ Diego Sequera live from Venezuela. A fairly concise unpacking with invested corporate interests and their political operatives over some decades. Highlights include McKinsey & Company, Hedge funds/asset mgmt, Marco Rubio [his long term agenda] his affiliation with María Corina Machado, AI techbro barons with a hint of Israel, and how some AI ex Executives are now full birds in the U.S. Military …. Topping it all of is a planned trip by a large group of investor types to Venezuela. Seeing how they can help with energy and infrastructure whilst spreading freedom and democracy to its peoples …. /s Rubio said it out loud … This is the Westren Hemisphere and WE don’t need nations that are not pro American by having/sharing trade et al with nations like China/Russia. As I noted yesterday in links Venezuela has a more conservative society than America, more family formation/value orientated. Good to see the currant batch of political operatives in DC being anti family – unless your wealthy and can donate. From another episode of America is trash, at an employer I know. For all those on the High Deductible plans, remember to always check your drug prices with GoodRX (or drug discount site of choice) and ask the pharmacy if they have any additional discounts. This 2 minute search each time can save you a significant amount of money at the register. Here is an example this morning for my daughter’s medications: * Her medication started at $316 for 30 days based on the Cigna Insurance deductible negotiated price. * Pulled up GoodRX while in line and without membership, it was $67 for 30 days. Showed this to the person at the checkout. They directed me to the consultation window. * At the consultation window, I showed them the GoodRX discount. They did a search and found that that medication has a CVS coupon for $51 for 30 days. * The pharmacist added the coupon to my daughter’s account and it will now apply for all future orders! Savings of $265 by doing a little research, asking questions, and waiting about 15 mins for them to reprocess the RX! Three things to note: 1. This discount dance has to be done for every prescription and for every dependent on your plan. 2. If there is no generic, there is typically a coupon at the manufacturers website. Do this in advance, as it sometimes requires doing a bit more information sharing and back and forth to get the discount codes. 3. This may effect the deductible amount depending on how it is processed and where you live. Fun times, yes? And we’ve learned from Pro Publica recently that our generic supply is potentially questionable, but the FDA doesn’t want to expose that, so we’re left in the dark about particular plants and particular drug manufacturing runs. I am so tired of having to play these games as my minimal prescriptions continue to rise in price regardless. fyi: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gusano Re: Venezeula Interesting statements from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and PM Takaichi: https://x.com/NaokoScalise/status/2007794084212302157 MOFA says (as expected): Japan has consistently respected fundamental values such as freedom and democracy. We have also consistently emphasized respect for the principles of international law within the international community. Moving forward, based on this consistent stance, we will continue to work closely with relevant countries, including the G7 and regional nations, to ensure the utmost protection for Japanese nationals. We will also advance diplomatic efforts aimed at restoring democracy and stabilizing the situation in Venezuela. Takaichi repeats the same talking points, but omitting mention of international law and the international community. Commentary: The heads of both the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court are Japanese. Wow, they’re erasing “international law” now. re: Craig Murray on Venezuela Craig Murray weighs in. He planned on going to Venezuela. This is not entirely off the table still. Important piece, although for those who followed events the last 25 years not new. https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2026/01/venezuela-and-truth/ “(…) By pure chance, on Friday I had texted Delcy Rodríguez about arrangements for travel and accreditation so I could go and report from Venezuela and bring you more of the truth from that country that the media is hiding from you. I made plain I was not asking for financial support. Things are obviously fluid at the moment, but it is still my intention to get there. (…)” Any comparison with other countries like Iran or Syria seems to make little sense. All these societies are unique. But much more important – Venezuela is a functioning and free country and society. And one needs to keep in mind the huge success Venezuela represents. As more than one commenter here has said: Once the “civilized nations” partook in or condoned the genocide in Gaza, everything became do-able. We are through the looking glass now. RIP “rules-based order” era. Hello, IRL Risk era. Guardian Live Blog: More on Donald Trump’s comments to reporters aboard Air Force One: the president said elections in Venezuela would have to wait. “We’re going to run it, fix it, we’ll have elections at the right time, but the main thing you have to fix is it’s a broken country,” he said. Trump had harsh words for other US adversaries, saying Colombia’s leader was “not going to be doing it very long”, Communist-ruled Cuba was “ready to fall” and that Iran’s leadership would be “hit hard” if protesters were killed, AFP reports. Trump earlier threatened that acting Venezuelan president Delcy Rodriguez would pay a “big price” if she did not cooperate with the US. Janta Ka Reporter Jan 5, 2026 YT channel video where Max Blumenthal interviews VP Delcy Rodríguez is a sight to behold. Points out the upside down human rights PR that Trump and Co project and how Nicolas Maduro and his wife are solid Christians. Your email address will not be published.

Get the FREE App Get the FREE App Australian investors continue to pile into US stocks, chasing outsized returns and their own piece of the artificial intelligence boom. Yet the era of tech giant dominance and a whirlpool of circular investment deals could mean a riskier bet than many realise. The popularity of funds linked to Wall Street's S&P500 index has soared and it's not hard to see why: returns over the past three years are more than 78 per cent compared to about 24 per cent for the local S&P/ASX200. But with just a handful of outsized companies and AI speculation driving broader market growth in 2025, a fund of 500 stocks might be less diversified than most of us think. And therein lies the rub. The so-called Magnificent Seven technology stocks of Apple, Nvidia, Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla, Meta and Microsoft make up more than a third of the S&P500 index's value, according to IG market analyst Tony Sycamore. "Then if you throw in Netflix and Broadcom, you're getting that dominance rising to closer to 45 per cent," he tells AAP. "Almost half the market cap is covered by nine stocks." By comparison, during the peak that preceded the dot-com crash in 2000, the six top tech companies accounted for roughly 15 per cent of the top 500 US stocks. There are many differences from the dot-com era, namely that most of the magnificent seven have pre-existing businesses that don't depend on AI. However the amount of money flowing into its research is eye-watering. Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Alphabet alone spent an estimated $US350 billion ($A520 billion) in 2025 on AI research and infrastructure, including the data centres required to power the technology's large language models. "There's valid concern around the Mag Seven; they don't seem to have the revenue to offset these heavy debt loads," Mr Sycamore says. "The cash burn for them is extraordinary and earnings have started to slow." The circular flow of funds between the tech juggernauts and into deals with pre-revenue companies like ChatGPT creator Open AI is also a worry despite headlines and agreements delivering vertigo-inducing stock price jumps. "The market is waking up to the fact that those announcements look great on the surface but underneath they're deeply concerning, artificial and prone to unravelling quickly," Mr Sycamore adds. "That is part of the reason why we have seen these tech stocks pull back." OpenAI, potentially the world's most valuable private company with an estimated market capitalisation of $US700 billion, intends spending $US1.4 trillion on AI infrastructure despite not expecting a profit until 2030. The gap has left many wondering where the money will come from. Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston has never seen a case study similar. "There's circular deals going off left, right and centre: Broadcom, AMD ... Nvidia has $US100 billion investment in OpenAI" he says. "And it's really all premised on the idea that, at some stage, OpenAI will be able to completely monetise their offering." But despite launching the first generative AI large language model ChatGPT in June 2018, which is now in its fifth iteration, competition in AI is white-hot. "When you've got so many of them coming up, backed by some massive players that are already seen as better alternatives, if OpenAI monetises at the wrong cost structure then it becomes a major issue," Mr Weston says. With this in mind, Pepperstone is watching Softbank, a Japanese investment holding group riding an "all-in" bet on OpenAI to generate $US22.5 billion funding via loans and the sale of Nvidia and T-Mobile stocks. As one of the biggest private tech deals in history, Softbank's play is seen as a barometer for the AI leader which, as a private concern, can't be accurately valued. Bank of America data points to roughly 94 per cent of tech profits being poured into AI spending, according to InvestorsObserver finance analyst Sam Bourgi. "These companies are spending almost all the money they earn," he says. "Just in September and October, big tech borrowed $75 billion specifically for AI data centres - more than double their normal annual borrowing." Notably, shares in the Tokyo-headquartered conglomerate plummeted more than 40 per cent in October. The implications of tech concentration for Australians invested in S&P500 index funds is straightforward, Mr Bourgi says. "You own a slice of all this risk and your index's performance now depends heavily on whether these six companies' AI bets work out. "If they succeed and AI becomes hugely profitable over the next few years, your index fund will likely perform well. "If they don't and this turns out to be another bubble like 2000, your index fund could suffer significant losses." A 30 per cent drift in AI stocks could mean a 10-15 per cent decline in an S&P500 index fund, which would leave investors in a tricky spot. "You might not see gains for years if the bubble deflates like in 2000," Mr Bourgi says.

Title: 30 hidden gems from 2025 to grab before the Steam Winter Sale ends

Time Published: 2026-01-02T17:01:00Z
Full Content:
2025 was an overwhelming year. Let's savor those positives in unlikely places. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. With each passing year, the PC gaming scene grows increasingly fragmented. More games are released, and on average they're better, too. There's just not enough time to cover them all, and 2025 was packed with gems you probably haven't heard of. For those willing to go just a little off the beaten path, the current Steam Winter Sale looks like a never-ending bounty of undersold treasures. So here's a carefully curated selection of 15 of my favorites to consider during the last couple days of sales season. Here are the rules I'm narrowing things down with: Since the year was so densely packed, I'm annoying the editors by slipping in a thematically related (but less beholden to the rules) alternative to each pick, for 30 games total. As ever, shout out your favourites, or comment if I helped you find something that made your heart sing. Let's go! Price: $21 / £17.50 (30% off) | Developer: Siris Pendrake A stunning testament to what a (mostly) solo developer can do with a modern engine and some stock asset packs. Still in early access, but already a very polished, lengthy and non-linear STALKER-inspired shooter with a funky setting. Mankind is effectively extinct. Lizard-people (which you're one of) have inherited the ruins of our civilization, and ancient fae magics leak in through the cracks of reality, as if rogue super-science wasn't enough. Project Silverfish feels like a pared-down, greased-up version of STALKER. Faster, twitchier, impressively polished (at the expense of some detail), able to run great on even lower-spec machines and requiring less fiddling around between sorties. Expect to be thrown into messy multi-faction battles right off the bat with loads of loot, getting you into deeper expeditions early. Alternatively: ADACA (50% off) - The previous game from the same developer, and effectively two games in one: A Half-Life 2/Halo-inspired story campaign and a STALKER-lite sandbox. Both surprisingly slick (and officially finished as of 2024), but Silverfish's open world & systems are on another level. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Price: $14 / £11.72 (30% off) | Developer: Figburn & Melon Hands up if you've still got a special place in your heart for Flash-era gaming, specifically Newgrounds. Contract Rush DX is a game forged in those familiar fires. It's a little bit Mega Man, a little bit Contra and more than a dash of Alien Hominid, all held together with globs of slick vectorized cartoon animation, unrealistic hyperviolence and goofy humor. They don't often make them like this anymore. Contract Rush DX doesn't rest on its nostalgic laurels though. There's a beefy, smart platformer here, with its main levels playable in any order and each with a distinct feel and mechanical twist. Recruit new characters to access extra areas or tackle bonus side-missions and work your way closer to the lore-laden reveals of the game's well-hidden True Ending. Alternatively: Seafrog (50% off) - Another platforming gem that fell between the cracks, now refreshed and under a new publisher's banner. A slick, high-technique blend of traditional platforming and Tony Hawk style skating, with big rewards for chaining long trick combos, giving every stage real replay value. Price: $12 / £10.05 (40% off) | Developer: LimboLane Not just a hidden gem, but one of my favourites of 2025. You're a Godpoke, wrangler of deities, sent to help put the bickering gods of this bizarre cartoon world back on the straight-and-narrow to avert the apocalypse. A refreshing take on the point-and-click adventure, as rather than hoard every item you find, you make up for your own quiet nature by using your suck 'n' blow megaphone to steal phrases from characters' dialogue and deploying them elsewhere as potential solutions. Or just to goof around. As with LimboLane's previous Smile For Me, this is an entire world of Weird Little Guys, even the cosmically huge gods. Everyone's at least a little bit of a freak, but they're all weirdly lovable. Especially the chaotically helpful 'bizzyboys' gang, the solution to and source of half the game's problems, and frequently featured in some deeply strange FMV puppet-show segments. Alternatively: Kulebra and the Souls of Limbo (40% off) - another offbeat adventure about hanging out with weird little guys of myth and legend. This time you're a snake-spirit in the Latin-American afterlife, trying to puzzle out how to break the eternal day-long loop that the dead are trapped in. Heartfelt, bittersweet and frequently funny. Price: $14 / £11.72 (30% off) | Developer: 13AM Games, Mighty Yell If you were to make a new Missile Command game, what kind of game would it be? Probably not 'Teen drama escape-room with tactical hex-based strategy'. This bizarre hybrid hasn't sold well at all, but it's a shockingly good and engaging time. Four teens set out to explore an abandoned cold war bunker, only to find themselves wrapped up in an escalating crisis necessitating a lot of point-and-click style puzzling and some almost Into The Breach-esque defensive turn-based battling. The combat involves planning moves two or three steps ahead, saving resources by catching multiple incoming missiles in chaining explosions, just like the old arcade game. The two halves dovetail nicely, using smaller defensive battle simulations as puzzle elements, while the larger, higher-stakes battles can dig into your stock of missile launch keycards that you scavenge from the dusty corners of the adventuring puzzle rooms, making resource conservation all the more vital. Tense and smart. Alternatively: Is This Game Trying To Kill Me? (50% off) - Another genre-hopping escape room adventure, although this one feels heavily inspired by Inscryption, as you explore a haunted videogame and the videogames within that videogame while being tormented by the (weirdly affable) entity lurking outside the rain-slick cabin window. Fun, goofy meta-narrative puzzling. Price: $6 / £5.10 (40% off) | Developer: Bubby Darkstar Shooty is our best, last line of defence against a possible robot invasion. Her crack team of robot-hunting pals are goofing off at the beach today. She doesn't have any clean clothes so she's requisitioning her commander's trousers today. Oh, and the robots are finally invading, but they don't seem to be especially threatening so you can just take your time and do some errands around town. Nobody seems too threatened. Shooty Shooty Robot Invasion feels like playing a webcomic. A particularly raucous, bright and chaotic one. Perhaps I'm just weird, but it's one of the funniest games I've played this past year, only really beaten out by Skin Deep. It's 70% exploring and meeting weird people and helping them with their daily problems, 30% light FPS combat as you blast robots using your special high-tech anti-robot bullets that only hurt machines. It's a surprisingly full package as well, clocking in at ~8 hours of shenanigans. Longer, if you're hunting for each mini open world level's secret sidequests. Alternatively: Fragrance Point (50% off) - Another 'Goofing around with weirdos' adventure, with a great rendercore aesthetic and an esoteric sci-fi spin. You're a new being, constructed to complete a very specific mission that you never got told because you accidentally blew up the tutorial by spitting lipstick everywhere. But hey, this space station seems to be a 24/7 party zone, so just go with the flow! Price: $18 / £15 (40% off) | Developer: Blue Banshee In a fit of spectacularly unfortunate timing, Maliki: Poison Of The Past was an offbeat take on the JRPG formula by a French studio released just two days before Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. It's arguably even more French, being based on a very long-running anime-tinged francophone webcomic, although no knowledge of the source material is needed to enjoy this standalone time-travelling adventure in high-intensity gardening. There is a lot going on here. Traditional turn-based RPG combat (with some timeline shenanigans); time-manipulating puzzles reminiscent of Zelda, with each party member bringing a new puzzle-solving power to the mix; even some low-impact farming between sorties across the timeline on your quest to stop the titular Poison, an evil plant-entity spreading its roots across space and time. It would be easy to draw comparisons to Chrono Trigger, but this one is a rich enough mix of inspirations to feel like its own thing. Alternatively: Wander Stars (33% off) - Another offbeat take on classic JRPG tropes, this time from Venezuela, and paying more than a little tribute to Akira Toriyama's wacky world of pint-sized martial artists and screwball comedy. Gorgeous art, simple, fight-heavy progression and creative combat where you collect a deck of words to chain into increasingly silly attack names to yell at full volume. Price: $10.50 / £7 (30% off) | Developer: Woodhound I've always had a soft spot for free-flying PSX-era shooter Forsaken, a faster, louder version of Descent. Despite an excellent (and cheap!) Nightdive remaster, it seemed doomed to fall into obscurity. But tiny studio Woodhound seems to hold a special torch for it too, releasing this roguelike tribute out of early access in 2025. It looks, sounds and plays almost exactly like Forsaken, right down to the intentionally blurry 'early 3D accelerator' textures and overbearing colored lighting, but now with near endless replay value and online co-op support. While Desecrators might lose something by not having hand-crafted levels, it does a very good job of procedurally generating labyrinthine mazes of tunnels, chambers and combat zones to blast through, punctuated with botmatch-style 'invasions' by rival treasure-hunters. It's still growing, too, with new enemies and environments added in a recent update, along with tentative VR support for those with strong stomachs. Alternatively: BRAZILIAN DRUG DEALER 3: I OPENED A PORTAL TO HELL IN THE FAVELA TRYING TO REVIVE MIT AIA I NEED TO CLOSE IT (30% off) - Another very singular tribute, although more of a deep cut. A tongue-in-cheek dive into the world of Brazil's early modding and game-dev scene, filled with in-jokes weirdness and an AMAZING title. But even taken purely on face value, it's a fun shooter running on the original Quake engine. Price: $3 / £2.55 (70% off) | Developer: Leafy Games Short, sweet and low-impact. At three dollars, it's very easy to recommend Wyrmhall, a game about being a funny little goblin running an artifact-cleaning stall in the middle of an interdimensional nexus. Weirdos from across the multiverse wander in, show you their cool (but all gunked up) cursed/blessed/incredibly dangerous doodads, chatting with you as you delouse, scrub and polish them up. The artifacts, not the clients. Although sometimes they're one and the same. Clocking in at just a couple hours long (with no shortage of twists and turns), this isn't an intense or complex game, but it is extremely funny, like playing through an extended Adventure Time skit full of gloriously wacky characters and some fun dialogue options that let you embrace your inner goblin. A good reminder that 'cozy' gaming doesn't just have to be about repackaged farming lifestyle fantasies. Sometimes you just wanna go Goblin Mode. Alternatively: Trash Goblin (40% off) - Would you believe that 2025 had TWO games about being a funny little goblin that cleans up strange artifacts? Trash Goblin is a bit less funny, but more technical, involved and mechanically engaging, using a lot more tools and upcycling to make your own goodies. Hell of a coincidence for lightning to strike twice. Price: $14 / £11.72 (30% off) | Developer: Pocket Trap It's a common lament that Nintendo has little interest in 'traditional' Zelda games now, favoring open world grandiosity over the classic NES and SNES-era format. Fortunately indies have you covered, and few do it as well as Pipistrello. The bones are solid—all the dungeon-crawling, puzzle-solving action you'd expect, fleshed out with a funky modern urban setting populated by rough-edged (but adorable) graffiti-styled critters, and with a few modern ideas like buying character upgrades on credit and paying them off over time. The star of the show is the titular Cursed Yoyo. Weapon, mobility gadget, multifunctional puzzle-solving tool and just fun to show off with, you'll be collecting new tricks for it all game long and each one opens up interesting new paths, making revisiting older areas engaging. Use slanted blocks to hit entire rooms with one spin, slam it against walls to launch yourself backwards over pits, and bypass obstacles by dragging yourself along using its string. It's just a joy to use. Alternatively: Zefyr: A Thief's Melody (75% off) - 'Retro' extends well into the Gamecube era these days, and if you're after something a little more Wind Waker-inspired, Zefyr is an excellent PC alternative. The work of a solo developer over the course of twelve years, this one's a satisfying piratical fantasy adventure with some great puzzle-laden dungeons. Price: $7 / £5.95 (30% off) | Developer: Brenton Wildes Loathe as I am to utter the word 'Metroidbrainia', it feels appropriate here. Lingo 2 is a brilliantly smart word puzzle adventure through a minimalist, Minecraft-esque block labyrinth where you interact with the world by typing letters into terminals. Simple. Except that you have to unlock one letter at a time like Metroid upgrades, and the phrase-and-response puzzles get painfully smart, fast. Sometimes you're looking for a word of the inverse meaning, or an anagram, or a palindrome, or a synonym, or a chain of words that connect several terminals together. The deeper you get, the more puzzles become available, and the more complex the world becomes, with secrets, hidden paths and optional areas seemingly everywhere with puzzles both spatial and lexical. My only gripe is that the game can be a bit US-centric, with some puzzles referring to specific American brands or idioms, but I never found it too egregious. The original Lingo is also discounted, and has its own set of puzzle mechanics so you can play them in any order. Alternatively: Rules & Rodents (40% off) - On the other end of the puzzle scale is Rules & Rodents, which is entirely wordless. A cute little mouse plots a cheese heist/escape armed with a magical scroll that holds pictograms that enable or disable specific gameplay rules controlling both you and the adorably animated rat guards. Just a few hours long, but feels perfectly paced with a surprisingly dramatic finale. Price: $10 / £8.37 (50% off) | Developer: Erlend Kirkeboe, Kay Arne Kirkeboe You can't go 10 minutes without bumping into a Slay the Spire-inspired deckbuilder these days, but few have the scribbly, grimy vision of Skogdal. Set in small-town '90s Norway, you'll be making your way through the streets battling an assortment of meatheads, weirdos and wildlife, all rendered in lumpen pencil-sketch comic style. There's a bit of Beavis and Butthead energy here as your crew of weird losers clash with retro pop culture seen through a uniquely Nordic lens. While each playable character brings their own gimmicks to the table, there's a big focus here on summoning friends into battle, who add their own cards to your deck and often add activatable powers to your party. While run-based, there's an increasingly weird story that unfurls as you complete runs, unlocking new characters (including a knock-off Norwegian Steven Segal) and new routes through the region. Not being Norwegian, some of the gags flew over my head, but most of them feel universal enough to land. Alternatively: Crown Gambit (40% off) - The latest from the team behind previous hidden gem Aetheris. A gorgeously illustrated twist on the card-battler format, split about 50/50 between visual novel-ish gothic knightly intrigue (with multi-choice dialogues) and party-based strategic battles. The two halves interplay, with the size and shape of the combat play-field shifting to reflect the prose. Price: $7.79 / £6.50 (35% off) | Developer: Fami Rough-edged, low-fi and abrasive in style, Schism feels like the kind of game I devoured in my youth. The kind of vaguely punk design that ruled in the late DOS shareware era. Under the intentionally rough aesthetic lies a very smart, experimental take on Binding of Isaac-esque action roguelike shootery. Weird creatures, weird characters, and even weirder item synergies (thoughtfully evolved as this game stewed in early access) make this one refreshing to chew on even if you're played a bunch of Games Like These. Schism isn't afraid to mentally overwhelm the player. Outside of the one small concession of pausing time as you enter a new room (letting you plan your initial movement before all hell breaks looks), there's some Ikaruga-inspired polarity switching mechanics, letting you negate red or blue bullets. You'd think that'd make things easier, but it just gives the game an excuse to blanket the screen with projectiles. Intense fun. Alternatively: Rift Wizard 2 (50% off) - Another low-fi roguelike, but more traditional in design. Positively archaic, even. Rift Wizard 2 feels most closely related to Chaos, an early cast-em-up by X-Com designer Julian Gollop. Rather than crawl through mazes for loot, each floor is a complex, open turn-based tactical battle demanding you use all your spells and summons. Price: $17.50 / £14.69 (30% off) | Developer: Dreamotion Inc. One of the higher-budget games here, released just a couple months ago. A silly but often heartstring-tugging, genre-hopping adventure about a corgi deciding to leave Dog Heaven after catching the distant scent of their human. Antics ensue, rainbow bridges are surfed across, adventures through the afterlife are had and not a single chance is missed to squeeze Big Feels out of the audience. As you might imagine it's not especially challenging stuff, but there's enough variety across the adventure (including a bunch of minigames and light challenges) to keep you engaged and paying attention. Long enough to keep eyes on the screen so you don't miss any of its gorgeously animated cutscenes, bridged with hand-drawn art. There's a real understanding here of how dogs move, especially the inherent wigglyness of short-legged friends like corgis, which means if you've ever had or lost a fuzzy little friend in your life, this one is going to hurt. Alternatively: Koira (50% off) - A surprisingly similar adventure, this one with a silhouetted, storybook aesthetic. A hermit and their dog enjoy life and nature in the mountains, interacting with wildlife, communing with the spirits and absolutely not getting into any life-or-death ordeals or supernatural goings on. Needless to say, the dog is also very good. They all are. Price: $7 / £5.95 (30% off) | Developer: Last Piscean A fantastically smart piece of sci-fi narrative experimentation. After the end of the world, three children discover a time machine. Perhaps the present can be rewritten, but the problem is that you can only send one person back at a time, with a single standing order and maybe one item, and they're going to have to spend a decade in that era before returning to base and reporting in, perhaps bringing back an item with them. Every choice is to be agonized over. The time spent in the past changes your trio. Personalities and statistics warp over time. Piecing together the origins of the apocalypse is just the first part of the puzzle, with over 20 possible endings depending on what factions you nudge or nurture, who you choose to assassinate and which child you choose for each expedition to the past. For a game presented almost entirely in (thoughtfully written) text and low-fi monochrome art, Decade is powerfully evocative. Alternatively: No Time (35% off) - If you want your time travel a little less esoteric and more tangible, this Back To The Future-inspired sandbox immersive sim has been in early access since 2019, and just recently added the final mission in its main story arc, though there's plenty yet to come. Price: $2.50 / £2.14 (50% off) | Developer: Jack Morehart 2025 was mostly a year for playing it safe in the strategy genre. DLCs, familiar genres, remasters and revivals. Kiloton is the sicko pick (I did say fewer, not none)—a minimalist, fast-paced simulation that feels like something lifted straight out of Wargames. The only winning game might be not to play, but playing with nukes can still be pretty fun. It's a lightweight geopolitical sim where you're ideally trying to avoid conflict, but every country is automatically jostling for position, with armies drawn to where there's any gap in defences. Diplomacy IS an option, but might just be denying the inevitable, and matches play out in a matter of minutes. What makes this game especially for sickos is that you play it entirely with the keyboard, with typed menu commands and simple menus navigated with the arrow keys, your clicking keypresses echoed in the game's own soundscape. Great for building tension, and will keep your hands moving quickly as things spiral out of control. Alternatively: Chip n' Clawz vs The Brainioids (30% off) - Would you believe that the creator of X-Com released a new strategy game for 2025, and it totally flew under the radar? A cartoon action-strategy game (a bit like Brutal Legend) playable the whole way through in split-screen co-op or via Friend Pass. A great way to introduce kids to the genre, and not too shabby even for veterans. And that's it for 2025. It wasn't an intentional theme, but there sure were a lot of games about terrifying apocalypses and hanging out with Weird Little Guys, weren't there? Let's avoid the former, and hang on to the latter in 2026. At least the videogames will be good, eh? Once again, I hope I've helped broaden your horizons a little, and maybe introduced you to a game or two to love. As always, check out my previous roundups below (and maybe even my Steam curator page, where everything I enjoy goes), as almost everything from previous sales is back again at even steeper discounts, and still as good as ever: Until next time, and happy new year! The product of a wasted youth, wasted prime and getting into wasted middle age, Dominic Tarason is a freelance writer, occasional indie PR guy and professional techno-hermit seen in many strange corners of the internet and seldom in reality. Based deep in the Welsh hinterlands where no food delivery dares to go, videogames provide a gritty, realistic escape from the idyllic views and fresh country air.

Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over three years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. Its stock price has soared, making it a $4.6 trillion market cap company. The world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in startups, particularly in AI. Nvidia has participated in nearly 67 venture capital deals in 2025, surpassing the 54 deals the company completed in all of 2024, according to PitchBook data. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly increased its investment pace over that period. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 30 deals this year, compared to just one in 2022.) Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million since 2023 where Nvidia is a named participant, organized from the highest to lowest amount raised in the round. This list shows just how far and wide Nvidia has spread its tentacles in the tech industry, beyond supplying its products. OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October 2024, reportedly writing a $100 million check as part of a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which invested $1.3 billion according to The New York Times. While PitchBook data indicates Nvidia did not participate in OpenAI’s $40 billion funding round that closed in March, the company announced in September that it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI over time, structured as a strategic partnership to deploy massive AI infrastructure. Nvidia later revealed in its quarterly filings that it might not follow through, stating, “There is no assurance that any investment will be completed on expected terms, if at all.” Anthropic: In November 2025, Nvidia made its first direct investment in the AI lab, committing up to $10 billion as part of a strategic round that included a $5 billion check from Microsoft. In a “circular” spending agreement, Anthropic committed to spending $30 billion on Microsoft Azure compute capacity, as well as buy Nvidia’s future Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin systems. Cursor: In November, Nvidia made its first strategic investment in the AI-powered code assistant participating in a massive $2.3 billion Series D round co-led by Accel and Coatue. The deal valued Cursor at $29.3 billion, a nearly 15-fold increase since the start of the year. While Nvidia has long been an enterprise customer, the round marked its official entry as a shareholder alongside Google. xAI: In 2024, OpenAI tried to persuade its investors not to invest in any of its rivals. But Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI last December anyway. Nvidia will also invest up to $2 billion in the equity portion of xAI’s planned $20 billion funding round, Bloomberg reported, a deal structured to help xAI purchase more Nvidia gear. Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the third time when the French-based large language model (LLM) developer raised a €1.7 billion (about $2 billion) Series C at a €11.7billion ($13.5 billion) post-money valuation in September. Reflection AI: In October, Nvidia was one of the most significant investors in Reflection AI, contributing to a $2 billion funding round that valued the one-year-old startup at $8 billion. Reflection AI is positioning itself as a U.S.-based competitor to Chinese DeepSeek, whose open source LLM offers a less-expensive alternative to closed source models from companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic. Thinking Machines Lab: Nvidia was among a long list of investors who backed former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab’s $2 billion seed round. The funding, which was formally announced in July, valued the new AI startup at $12 billion. Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the more unusual (but increasingly common) outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman, the famed founder of DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. Crusoe: In October, the chipmaker participated in a $1.4 billion Series E round that valued the AI data center developer at $10 billion. Nvidia first backed the company in late 2024 during its Series D. Crusoe is a key infrastructure partner for the ‘Stargate’ project, building massive data center campuses in Texas and Wyoming to be leased to Oracle specifically to power OpenAI’s workloads. Nscale: After the startup’s $1.1 billion round in September, Nvidia participated in Nscale’s $433 million SAFE funding in October. That’s a deal that secures future equity for investors. Nscale, which formed in 2023 after spinning out of Australian cryptocurrency mining company Arkon Energy, is building data centers in the U.K. and Norway for OpenAI’s Stargate project. Wayve: In May 2024, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. Nvidia is expected to invest an additional $500 million in Wayve, the startup told TechCrunch in September. Wayve is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. Figure AI: In September, Nvidia participated in Figure AI’s Series C funding round of over $1 billion, which valued the humanoid robotics startup at $39 billion. The chipmaker first invested in Figure in February 2024 when the company raised a $675 million Series B round at a $2.6 billion valuation. Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. In June, Meta invested $14.3 billion for a 49% stake of Scale and hired away the company’s co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang, as well as several other key Scale employees. Commonwealth Fusion: The chipmaker participated in the nuclear fusion-energy startup’s $863 million funding round in August. The deal, which also included investors like Google and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, valued the company at $3 billion. Cohere: The chipmaker has invested in enterprise LLM provider Cohere across multiple funding rounds, including the $500 million Series D, which closed in August, valuing Cohere at $6.8 billion. Nvidia first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023. Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November 2023 and has participated in most of the subsequent funding rounds of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round closed in December 2024. The chipmaker participated in the company’s July funding round, which valued Perplexity at $18 billion. However, Nvidia did not join the startup’s subsequent $200 million fundraise in September, which boosted the company’s valuation to $20 billion, according to PitchBook data. Poolside: In October 2024, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion. Lambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda’s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia’s GPUs. Black Forest Labs: Nvidia participated in a $300 million Series B for the German startup behind the “Flux” image generation models in December. The round, which was co-led by Salesforce Ventures and Anjney Midha (AMP) valued the company at $3.25 billion. CoreWeave: Although CoreWeave is no longer a startup, but a public company, Nvidia invested in GPU-cloud provider when it was still one, back in April 2023. That’s when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Nvidia remains a significant shareholder. Together AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023. Firmus Technologies: In September, Firmus Technologies, the Singapore-based data center company, received an AU$330 million (approximately $215 million) in funding at an AU$1.85 billion ($1.2 billion) valuation from investors, including Nvidia. Firmus is developing an energy-efficient “AI factory” in Tasmania, an island state of Australia. The startup originally provided cooling technologies for Bitcoin mining. Uniphore: In October, Nvidia joined fellow tech giants AMD, Snowflake, and Databricks to lead a $260 million Series F round into this Business AI company. Uniphore’s multimodal platform helps enterprises automate complex workflows and deploy “AI agents” across customer service, sales, and marketing. Sakana AI: In September 2024, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Sakana raised another $135 million at a $2.65 billion valuation in November, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Nuro: In August, Nvidia participated in a $203 million funding round for the self-driving delivery startup. The deal valued Nuro at $6 billion, a significant 30% drop from its peak at $8.6 billion valuation in 2021. Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt. Waabi: In June 2024, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Ayar Labs: In December 2024, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup. Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity. Sandbox AQ: In April, Nvidia, alongside Google, BNP Paribas, and others, invested $150 million in Sandbox AQ, a startup developing large quantitative models (LQMs) for handling complex numerical analysis and statistical calculations. The investment increased Sandbox AQ’s Series E round to $450 million and the company’s valuation to $5.75 billion. Hippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation. Hippocratic raised another $126 million at a valuation of $3.5 billion in November, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Weka: In May 2024, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion. Runway: In April, Nvidia participated in Runway’s $308 million round, which was led by General Atlantic and valued the startup developing generative AI models for media production at $3.55 billion, according to PitchBook data. The chipmaker has been an investor in since 2023. Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup. Enfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. The startup raised another $115 million in November 2024, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. In September, Nvidia reportedly spent over $900 million to hire Enfabrica’s CEO and staff while licensing its technology, in a deal structured as an “acquihire.” Reka AI: In July, AI research lab Reka raised $110 million in a round that included Snowflake and Nvidia. The deal tripled the startup’s valuation to over $1 billion, according to Bloomberg. This post was first published in January 2025.

Title: Apple needs a visionary QB again: It’s past time for game manager Tim Cook to hand off the ball

Update font size. Reset In American football, a “game manager” quarterback is one who protects the ball, executes the playbook, and keeps the scoreboard ticking through steady, conservative play. Tim Cook has been precisely that for Apple: an operations maestro who took the reins from the legendary Steve Jobs in 2011 and transformed the company into a financial juggernaut, ballooning its market cap from $350 billion to over $4 trillion through supply-chain efficiency, massive stock buybacks, and incremental refinements of products created under Apple’s visionary co-founder Steve Jobs. Yet, as Jobs himself might have envisioned, Cook was never meant to be the long-term playmaker — the electrifying, risk-taking, charismatic visionary who redraws the field with bold, game-changing innovations. Jobs built Apple on “insanely great” breakthroughs: the Mac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. Under Cook’s stewardship, however, the company has increasingly relied on iteration rather than revolution, neglecting opportunities in AI (like the long-stagnant Siri), launching underwhelming entries like Vision Pro in rushed form, and prioritizing financial engineering over audacious product leaps. Nearly 15 years into his tenure — one far longer than Jobs likely intended for a transitional “caretaker” CEO — Apple stands at a crossroads. With executive departures signaling the end of an era and succession planning accelerating, it’s time for Cook to step aside. The world’s most valuable company deserves a charismatic, exciting leader once more: a true visionary capable of reigniting the magic that made Apple not just profitable, but culturally unstoppable. Richard Waters for Financial Times: ‎ The Financial Times’ report that succession planning at Apple is now in high gear makes it seem increasingly likely that the pre-eminent consumer tech company will soon be under new management. Strong demand for the iPhone 17 lifted Apple’s stock market value past $4tn for a while over the past month. With a strong tailwind from the huge stock buybacks that Cook instigated as one of his first acts as chief, the share price is up 20-fold from the day he took over in 2011. But, with artificial intelligence threatening the biggest upheaval to the tech world in decades, Cook will also leave huge questions. His successor will need to demonstrate a stronger appetite for risk and a willingness to bet on a new vision for how technology can reshape people’s lives… His successor will need to show that they can both co-opt AI to reinforce what Cook built while also harnessing its disruptive potential to ride the next consumer tech wave. The botched launch of Apple Intelligence — key parts of which were delayed early this year — was worrying. How much that will matter in the long run is hard to tell… But there are obvious risks to taking a back seat in the AI revolution. If LLMs are at the centre of innovation, then acting merely as a rent collector while leaving it to others to define the next must-have digital experiences would put Apple in an uncomfortable position. Also, if LLMs come to represent what is essentially a new operating system, they will have strategic importance. Hopefully, the days of a COO masquerading as an Apple CEO are finally drawing nigh. Apple deserves a visionary leader who can once again drive relentless, world-changing product innovation. – MacDailyNews, December 9, 2025 The Vision Pro headset represented his biggest gamble on a new device… But as a compelling vision of how mixed-reality headsets will change your life — the kind of thing that Steve Jobs excelled at — it was a flop. Instead, Meta has stolen a lead with a more lightweight, fashion-conscious range of “smart” glasses… Apple’s next chief will need to increase the scale of the company’s bets. Among the first jobs: convincing its shareholders, who have become accustomed to the iPhone’s steady profits, that it is time to look beyond Tim Cook’s gravy train. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: As our own SteveJack wrote last July: Steve Jobs famously said of Tim Cook, “Tim is not a product person, per se.” That has turned out to be an understatement, especially with the fact that the Apple Watch, AirPods, and even the Vision Pro concept began under Jobs. I’ve closely observed Apple for decades and I believe that Steve Jobs never meant for Tim Cook to be Apple’s CEO in 2025. When Jobs handpicked Cook as his successor in 2011, many believed it was a strategic move to stabilize the company during a tumultuous transition following Jobs’ untimely death. However, I contend that Jobs intended Cook to serve as a short-term CEO, a 3-5 year placeholder to mollify investors, not to lead Apple for nearly a decade and a half, stagnating its innovative spirit, jettisoning innovative executives, while relying on financial engineering, mainly in the form of hundreds of billions of dollars in buybacks, to prop up the company’s success. Jobs, a visionary known for his relentless pursuit of groundbreaking products, built Apple into a cultural and technological titan with the Mac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. His genius lay in anticipating consumer needs before they did. Cook, hired from Compaq in 1998 as Senior Vice President of Worldwide Operations, was the operational mastermind behind Apple’s supply chain efficiency, going all-in on CCP-controlled China to maximize Apple’s profit margins. Jobs clearly valued Cook’s logistical prowess, but I believe Jobs saw Cook as a caretaker, not a long-term visionary, expecting him to maintain stability for a few years until a product-focused, visionary successor emerged. Under Cook, Apple’s market capitalization soared from $376 billion in 2011 to over $3.9 trillion in early 2025 making it the world’s most valuable company (it has since shed some $800 billion over the year, falling to third place behind Nvidia and rival Microsoft). Yet, much of this growth stems from financial engineering, service expansions like iCloud and Apple Music, and a steady stream of annual incremental product updates, rather than revolutionary Jobsian innovation. The Apple Watch, AirPods, and Vision Pro were initiated under Jobs’ tenure, with their completion coming during Cook’s tenure. The Apple Car project, also conceived by Jobs, was abandoned after a long, chaotic, and costly period under Cook. It’s clear that Cook lacks the disruptive, charismatic spark Steve Jobs infused throughout Apple. Basically, all of Apple’s successes under Cook are iterations of Steve Jobs’ products and services. Cook’s lack of hands-on product involvement has slowed innovation, with half-baked products like the Vision Pro being launched to consumers too early and, unsurprisingly, failing to sell. Apple clearly missed the generative AI (GenAI) paradigm shift under Cook and has been struggling to catch up ever since. Steve Jobs likely would not have released the Vision Pro and visionOS in the condition they were launched under Tim Cook. Jobs very likely would have not neglected Siri (which he purchased) for over a decade and a half and would almost certainly have foreseen GenAI early. Very likely, Jobs focus on Siri would have led him and Apple to GenAI first. Visionary Jobs’ main focus was about creating “insanely great” products; Cook’s seems to be about iteration and other, side pursuits. If Jobs intended Cook as a relatively short-term placeholder, the question remains: who was meant to follow? Speculation points to figures like former software chief Scott Forstall — who Cook rather quickly forced out of the company, ostensibly over the botched Maps launch (which way okayed by Cook, by the way) – and head product designer Jony Ive, who left Apple after years of feeling unchallenged under Cook. Jobs highly valued both executives, even granting Ive more operational power than Cook at the time of his death. Today, Ive is collaborating with OpenAI on a potentially revolutionary AI product, not working for Apple. The departure of these executives, whether explicit or tacit, conveniently solidified Cook’s long-term hold on the CEO role. While Cook’s canned-video tenure has been financially stellar overall, Apple has for many years coasted and thrived on Jobs’ lingering momentum, propped up by Cook’s beige operational savvy and financial engineering. After Cook’s tenure finally, blessedly ends, only time will reveal if Apple can rediscover its Jobsian revolutionary edge. ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

No more modern experiments with leadership with twinks. THEY HAVE TO ALL GO, AS WITH ANY TRANSGENDER LOONS. O-U-T! His contribution…the pregnant man emoji.🤣 Amen to that! He should have retired 8-10 years ago. “The Vision Pro headset represented his biggest gamble on a new device… But as a compelling vision of how mixed-reality headsets will change your life — the kind of thing that Steve Jobs excelled at — it was a flop. Instead, Meta has stolen a lead with a more lightweight, fashion-conscious range of “smart” glasses…” the Vision Pro is NOT a flop. it’s spectacular technology that’s very much a Version 1 (/developer) device. a lot of apple’s new tech was a ‘flop’ at launch, and then iterated over time into successful mass market products. the Vision Pro represents such a leap forward that a bold new less consumer-friendly opening salvo was necessary to start the wheels turning. eventually the technology will evolve into a viable next generation product. A product may be cool & advanced, but if it represents 8% of the market, it’s not sustainable and in business terms, it’s a flop. From the beginning, AAPL forecasted 3 million units for the first year, but early sales estimates landed around 200,000 units. Flopping early. When a WEARABLE item is notoriously uncomfortable, in-spite of offering a magical experience when using, it’s a blunderous flop. Jobs would have breathed flames on just this one aspect alone. Easy to discern (pain), relatively easy to fix, but still released! From what I gather, someone with needed acute standards, could make AVP market-relevant. This is just one products during Cook’s term that was befuddlingly mishandled. Siri agrees, as she knows. You are correct John. My Vision Pro was only used sporadically since I bought it (lots of travel and caregiving for family) in late 2024, but over the past few weeks i’ve been using it daily and I am astounded at how much the experience has improved. Little things are better like the digital crown now being able to control either environment immersion or volume depending on which icon you are looking at. And big things like pass-through video quality noticeably improving, eye tracking and gestures being even more accurate and being able to view my iPad Pro as a giant display (like Mac Virtual Display but without widescreen options). Obviously price was always going to be a limiting factor but issues like bulk or discomfort have been massively overblown. Apple had to get this product out into the wild in order to start iterating on it and improving it through real-world use. Even in 2026 this is bleeding-edge tech that’s a marvel to experience. The technologies developed for the Vision Pro will trickle down to more consumer friendly (and less exciting) glasses. By the end of the decade I expect the Vision Pro to look more like 80s visor-style sunglasses that you can quickly slip on and off (perhaps still with an external battery or tethered to a Mac/iPad). My primary complaints against Vision Pro is the poor marketing. It was never meant to be a pair of smart glasses that you walk around in, that’s a separate product category that we may see a preview of later this year.

Title: Vitalik Buterin maps Ethereum’s 2026 rebellion against centralised ‘overlords’

About us Copy link Ethereum is charging into 2026 with a manifesto — not a roadmap. That message comes directly from co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who said that Ethereum is the “rebellion” against “centralised overlords.” “We’re building decentralised applications,” Buterin said on X. “Applications that run without fraud, censorship or third-party interference.” The $365 billion blockchain network aims to be “civilisational infrastructure” that can resist censorship, service intermediaries, and corporate dominance, he said. “These properties sound radical,” he wrote, “but we must remember that a generation ago any wallet, kitchen appliance, book or car would fulfill every single one of them.” Buterin’s note comes as power and wealth in the technology industry become increasingly concentrated in the hands of just a few top corporate players from Silicon Valley, who are all highly centralised. The Mag 7 US tech companies, such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla, are now worth more than the combined stock markets of Japan, Canada, and the UK. “Ethereum is the rebellion against this,” Buterin said. “Fortunately, we have powerful tools on our side,” he wrote. “But we need to apply them, and we will.” Buterin may be championing Ethereum’s decentralised nature, but many of the banks, traditional financial firms and fintechs exploring launching stablecoins are doing so on the Ethereum blockchain — letting centralised companies use the digital ledger. Ethereum is kicking off the new year trading nearly 40% below its August all-time high of $4,950. Investors in recent months have been relentlessly dumping exchange-traded funds backed by the second-largest crypto. DefiLlama data shows $616 million in Ethereum ETF selling in December, adding to November’s $1.4 billion in liquidations. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 stock index is still hovering near all-time highs. Other assets, such as gold, are also pushing to record highs amid strong macroeconomic tailwinds. To be sure, Ethereum has plenty of bullish institutional supporters. Tom Lee, chairman of digital asset treasury firm Bitmine, said on X that he expects Ethereum to have a good 2026. “Gold moves lead crypto,” Lee said. “If these large commodity markets make such a move, how can one be skeptical of digital assets in 2026?” Lance Datskoluo is DL News’ Europe-based markets correspondent.

2025 in phones, computing, TVs, gaming, cameras, streaming and more When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. So farewell, 2025 – you were frequently exciting, regularly chaotic, occasionally frustrating but always interesting. And that’s how we like it around here. It was a year in which often fairly iterative improvements to hardware were overshadowed by rapid and significant advances on the computing side of things. I’m talking, of course, about AI, which is now so dominant within the tech world that it’s increasingly hard to find a device that doesn’t have an AI brain. Not that I’m complaining, because the leaps made in 2025 by the likes of OpenAI’s Sora and Google’s Gemini were truly astonishing; the pace of change is such that it feels like we’re squeezing about a decade’s worth of advances into each year now, and I wouldn’t like to predict what the state of play will be in 12 months’ time. Well, other than to say that we’ll be taking for granted things which seem almost impossible right now – although as our AI Editor Graham Barlow notes below, maybe we’re already doing that. In comparison, it often looked in 2025 as though things were slowing down on the hardware side. Could Apple really make its already-excellent MacBooks much better? Could Samsung improve much on the superb Galaxy S series? Was there much scope for OLED TVs or wireless headphones or mirrorless cameras to develop? The answer was yes, yes and yes. Though the upgrades to many models may not have been as big as those on the software side, they were frequently excellent in their own right. The improvements to battery life, screen tech and camera lenses may not be as flashy as those on the AI front, but they can make a real difference to how we use our devices on a daily basis. In many ways, tech fans have never had it so good. Whether that will continue in 2026 remains to be seen. AI now looks to be having a direct – and negative – effect on component prices, which could make your favorite new phone or laptop more expensive in the coming year. We might also see stock shortages in some areas, which could further inflate those price tags. It looks like we’re set for another year of exciting, chaotic, frustrating and interesting news, then – and we’ll be here with you every step of the way. Until then, I hope you’ve enjoyed reading TechRadar in 2025, and have a happy New Year! Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. This year was marked by astonishing leaps in AI capabilities, which I tried to not only report on but experience in full. From my first experience with ‘vibe coding’ to wild leaps of fancy with Veo 3 (and later the Sora app) to creating my own digital double, AI’s fast-changing capabilities constantly amazed me. Never in four decades of covering emerging technologies have I seen anything like it: AI’s rise continues to be a heady mixture of enthusiastic adoption tinged with white-knuckled fear about what it all means for jobs, and for humanity, and nothing we saw in 2025 did much to resolve that anxiety. However, it was my conversations with those leading the AI and wider innovation charge that stood out. My interviews with Amazon’s Panos Panay about Alexa+ and Google’s Sameer Samat about the future of Android were particularly memorable, as was the moment when one of Apple’s top executives threw his brand-new iPhone Air to me during a video podcast and insisted that I try to bend it. The rise of humanoid robots was a trend that shocked and pleased me in equal measure, though I’ve tried to temper my enthusiasm with the knowledge that clever marketing and eye-popping videos will only get us so far. We all want the ultimate home robot, but I still don't think many of us are willing to pay $20,000 to get it. Away from all the AI and robots, I spent much of the year trying new phones, including redesigned iPhones and an incredibly thin folding Samsung phone, along with a wide range of wearable technology that included the Galaxy XR headset, and some very exciting AR glasses from Meta and Google’s Android XR group. Experiencing these felt like peering into our near technological future, which increasingly will be filled with on-demand AI, flexible phones, and maybe those robots. For all the talk of breakthroughs and hype, 2025 felt less like the year AI changed everything and more like the year it quietly became unavoidable. While the much-hyped arrival of super-powerful artificial general intelligence (AGI), predicted for 2025 by many, simply hasn’t materialized, the year has still been a strong one for companies such as OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, and Google. That said, there have also been some massive flops; and as for Apple, it feels like yet another year in which it slipped further behind in the AI race. ChatGPT maintained its vice-like grip as the most popular AI chatbot in the world, though it hasn’t been plain sailing for OpenAI. Legal challenges, particularly the copyright infringement claim brought by The New York Times, have continued to dog the company, and in June its servers crashed for a couple of days, giving the world a brief taste of life without the ubiquitous chatbot. OpenAI then fumbled the ball with the release of its GPT-5 model, which came across as cold and unemotional compared to the previous GPT-4o. For millions of users who’d come to rely on the chatbot as something closer to a trusted companion it felt like a best friend had undergone a personality transplant overnight, forcing OpenAI to make the legacy 4o model available again. The company has also lost a little ground to Google’s Gemini in recent months. The arrival of Gemini 3 Pro in November was well received, and on the image front, Gemini’s Nano Banana and Nano Banana Pro proved superior to ChatGPT for image generation. OpenAI responded with a new image-generation model in December. AI-powered pets and toys also began to appear this year. We took Moflin for a spin, until we accidentally fried its battery. More broadly, the dominant theme of the year was that every product must now have AI built into it in some form, and no company exemplifies this approach better than Microsoft, which has spent the year enthusiastically stuffing Copilot into just about everything it makes. Finally, the year looks set to end on a high note for Amazon. Alexa+, the AI-powered version of Alexa that Amazon has been promising all year but hasn’t yet managed to fully roll out, may finally be getting a web version, at least in the US. 2025 was the year of the super-thin phone, writes Roland Moore-Colyer, Managing Editor, Mobile Computing, with the release of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge in the first half of the year, and the iPhone Air in the second. These handsets grabbed headlines with their svelte proportions, but so far sales figures have yet to match the hype. That’s likely due to their relatively high prices in the face of already pretty slim iPhones and Galaxy and Pixel handsets, all of which saw the expected yearly upgrades with the iPhone 17, Galaxy S25 and Pixel 10 lines respectively. While the upgrades to the iPhone 17 family appeared incremental at first glance, I'd argue they're a bigger deal when you dig into the details: there was a new design and cooling system for the Pro phones, the standard model finally got a 120Hz display, and Apple's 48MP 'Fusion' camera came to every iPhone in the lineup, including the Air (the Plus model went the way of the dodo). AI found its way into more phones and more features, with Google’s Pixel phones in particular boasting a whole host of genuinely useful smart tools. Meanwhile, Apple just about managed to distract us from the shortcomings of Apple Intelligence with its flashy Liquid Glass design and the eye-catching Cosmic Orange iPhone 17 Pro. Some of the most interesting phones came from smaller brands, with the Nothing Phone 3 offering something a little different without scrimping on flagship features. There was the Oppo Find X9 Pro with its strange but useful camera kit, while the OnePlus 15 was the only phone to earn a maximum five-star review from us this year. There were also a clutch of affordable phones from the likes of Motorola and Xiaomi, proving that you don’t have to pay a lot to get a very capable smartphone these days. We saw further evolution in the folding phone space, with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 leading the way, and Samsung also unveiled its first tri-folding phone, with the Galaxy Trifold joining Huawei's Mate XT, and teasing a future of devices that truly blend phones and tablets. We may even see a foldable iPhone in 2026, but don’t hold your breath. When it came to computing, 2025 didn't start off as the most promising year. While 2024 felt like a year of revolutionary change, with the explosive growth of AI, the fall of Intel, and the rise of Arm-based laptops that were actually worth buying, this year has felt more like we're in a holding pattern, as the innovations of the past few years are iterated on and refined.The year kicked off with Nvidia launching its latest generation of consumer graphics cards, the RTX 5000 series, at CES 2025, and they encapsulated the ‘evolution, not revolution’ theme, with some great new features that haven't fundamentally shaken up the industry, as the introduction of ray tracing with the RTX 2000 series did. Of course, making a great product even better is no bad thing, and our components editor and GPU expert John Loeffler was suitably impressed, enthusing in his RTX 5090 review that “If you're a gamer, you'll still get impressive gen-on-gen performance improvements over the celebrated RTX 4090, and the Nvidia RTX 5090 is really the first consumer graphics card I've tested that can get you consistent, high-frame-rate 8K gameplay.”I have an RTX 5090 and I love it, and I've also been impressed by its 8K performance in modern games, but with the majority of PC gamers still playing at 1080p, this high-end GPU might be a bit too expensive to justify. Other releases from AMD and Intel, plus Apple’s latest M5 chip, continued the theme of impressive releases that don’t massively change the computing landscape.Perhaps the biggest event in 2025 was the continued rise of AI. Recently, the AI boom has led to a global shortage of memory, which has in turn caused an increase in the prices of devices that use it. All of a sudden, PCs, RAM, and GPUs look set to get increasingly expensive, though some, like our computing editor Christian Guyton, aren’t too worried – yet. Personally, the end-of-year drama is making me nostalgic for those early months when 2025 felt rather boring. This year saw two really interesting developments in TV technology, with the first being the arrival of a whole new kind of ‘Tandem RGB’ OLED TV panel from LG. This appeared in the LG G5, helping it to score the maximum five stars in our review, and in the fantastic Panasonic Z95B, enabling both TVs to hit stunning levels of brightness and color depth, but with reduced power consumption. However, this new screen technology didn’t win either of those sets our TV of the Year award – that went to the Samsung S95F, which not only earned its own perfect 5-star review, but was also voted the top TV in the most categories by the judges in our flagship OLED TV showdown, which pitted it against the LG G5, Panasonic Z95B, and Sony Bravia 8 II. The second big tech development was the arrival of RGB mini-LED tech – and, make no mistake, this is the next big thing. It’s more efficient than current mini-LED tech, and is capable of richer colors and less light leakage from bright areas to dark ones, and it could be the tech to finally knock OLED off its perch. We know that Samsung, LG, TCL and Hisense will all launch RGB mini-LED TV ranges in 2026, but the Hisense UX116 was the only TV to use it in 2025 – and it was a mixed bag, with performance issues that disappointed given its eye-wateringly high price. Still, we’re excited to see how this tech develops. But the biggest thing in TVs this year was the TVs themselves – as in, they got big and they got affordable. TCL and Hisense launched 85-inch and 100-inch TVs that were within the budgets of regular mortals, and 75-inch TVs are becoming positively cheap, while still being good. While new tech is exciting, huge TVs like the Hisense U8N and TCL QM7K becoming more affordable is the change that made the biggest difference for customers. This year XR or 'extended reality' took center stage, thanks in large part to Android XR hardware finally breaking cover in the shape of the Samsung Galaxy XR headset. We also tested prototype Android XR glasses ahead of their expected release in the coming year, and they’re impressive (the glasses at least, the headset less so right now). Google, along with its Android partners, looks set to seriously challenge Meta in 2026. For its part Meta debuted several new smart wearables over the past 12 months, including two pairs of Oakley smart glasses – the stylish HSTNs and the sporty Vanguards, the latter of which are perfect for runners when used with a compatible Garmin watch. We also saw a Gen 2 model of the Meta Ray-Bans, and the company's latest step towards full-on AR specs, the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which as you can probably guess feature a display for the specs to relay info visually. We’ve tested them, and they’re everything Google Glass wanted to be, but right now they're not easy to get hold of. What about VR headsets proper? Valve surprised no one (because the device was so heavily leaked before launch) with its Steam Frame headset announcement. Key details like the price are still a mystery, but it will be landing in 2026 – and when it does, the spec sheet teases a device that could seriously challenge the reigning champion of VR, the Meta Quest 3. Depending on how Valve handles the launch, I wouldn’t be surprised if it makes all other headsets feel obsolete – even the Galaxy XR and Apple Vision Pro. Talking of Apple's mixed-reality spatial-computing headset, we got a new version with an M5 chip and comfier strap, but while it's a worthwhile upgrade the price still feels too high. If 2024 was the year niche UK hi-fi brands took over the dance floor amid a hiatus from audio's heavy hitters (see Bowers & Wilkins' fantastic Pi8 earbuds or Cambridge Audio's inaugural, affordable, adorable P100 cans), 2025 was the year the big dogs returned to the party and got their groove back. We got five major headphones releases in 2025, starting with the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds in February. The hotly anticipated update to the 2019 Powerbeats Pro proved that Apple could indeed deliver heart-rate monitoring in its earbuds. Cut to May and Sony's WH-1000XM6 landed, to finally knock the 2020-issue WH-1000XM4 off the top spot in our best headphones guide. It was a similar story with the June arrival of the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen), quickly followed by the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) in September – a two-pronged attack on the market that saw Bose reinstated as the king of ANC. However, this roundup wouldn't be complete without a nod to the biggest launch of them all: the fall arrival of Apple's AirPods Pro 3. The shape's different, the ANC is twice as good, and yes, like the Powerbeats Pro 2 they also keep tabs on your ticker, in a slightly different way, and with increasing third-party fitness-app support. Still the most popular earbuds in the world? Absolutely. Elsewhere, Spotify Lossless finally landed, at no cost to Premium subscribers, offering almost-as-good-as-Apple-Music resolution at up to 24-bit/44.1kHz. While Lossless wasn't a huge hit with fans initially, the big green streaming machine's popularity continues to grow, despite concerns over artist payments. Oh, and if you take note of just one audio brand name this year, let it be WiiM. As Sonos continues to tackle trust issues among its once-loyal fanbase, the plucky multi-room underdog unveiled its WiiM Sound (and now the WiiM Sound Lite) premium hi-res speakers – and the firm would love to help you build your wireless sound system around them. 2025 was full of pleasant surprises for photographers. The Sigma BF was truly out of the ordinary, being dubbed ‘the camera Apple would have made’, while the Caira with its Nano Banana AI skills showed us a glimpse of how on-the-go generative editing can work in an actual camera. Fujifilm and OM System showed us that user experience matters with the quirky X half and retro OM-3 respectively, while Hasselblad and Nikon delivered strong offerings of their own – my favorite stills camera ever, the X2D II, and a new player in the cinema-camera game, the Nikon Zr. A special shoutout goes to Nikon for becoming the best-value camera brand this year, notably for the excellent Z5 II, which is our Camera of the Year, and Z50 II. It was arguably an even better year for new lenses than cameras, with Sigma, Sony and Viltrox in particular knocking it out the park with world-first and affordable optics. Canon continues to lock out third parties from its full-frame camera lineup, but that decision feels more justified after it launched the affordable and capable 45mm F1.2 STM prime. A sense of order was restored towards the end of the year when Canon and Sony launched their anticipated mid-range full-frame cameras: the EOS R6 III and A7 V, both of which are integral to their lineups. The long-threatened US ban on DJI products finally came into effect, and we saw a couple of major product launches from the brand in the build-up to it: the incredible (sort of) sub-250g Mini 5 Pro, and the DJI Osmo 360 – its first foray into 360 cameras, and rival to both the Insta 360 X5 and GoPro’s new Max 2. DJI is also being tipped to launch its first 360 drone soon, but Insta360 got there first with the truly innovative Antigravity A1. Overall, it’s been a good year for camera fans, with demand seemingly remaining strong in the face of competition from increasingly capable smartphones. I’m predicting that the consumer and cinema camera spaces will continue converging in 2026, and I hope the likes of Viltrox expand our options with new and affordable autofocus zoom lenses. Gaming in 2025 was largely dominated by the arrival of the Nintendo Switch 2. It’s a safe improvement on the original Switch, and one that epitomizes the ‘evolution not revolution’ approach to console development. The specs sheet won’t blow anyone’s socks off, but it’s a superb package that cements the Switch's position as the go-to handheld console; and it was so popular in the pre-order and launch phases that it took months for retailers to catch up with demand. It’s been backed up by some excellent games too, including Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, Kirby Air Riders, and Pokémon Legends Z-A. Sony had its own say in the gaming handheld space, breathing new life into the PlayStation Portal handheld device, which is now capable of excellent cloud streaming. This has elevated the handheld, which we were already big fans of, to impressive new heights. The PS5’s game library got a bump with Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and Ghost of Yotei, as well as titles including Borderlands 4, Battlefield 6, Arc Raiders and TechRadar Gaming’s Game of the Year, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Elsewhere, indie games ruled, with the likes of Blue Prince, Hades 2, and Hollow Knight: Silksong proving standouts in a strong year for releases. It’s been a year to forget for Xbox, however, and its woes only accentuated the aforementioned successes for Nintendo and Sony. For starters, more Xbox games – including Gears of War: Reloaded – arrived on PS5, while others are set to follow, including the symbol of Xbox itself, Halo. Meanwhile studios were shuttered and prospective games cancelled, and to make matters worse the Xbox X/S were outsold by a tiny family console, the Nex Playground, over Black Friday. All in all it’s been tough going for Team Green. As for 2026, it’s beginning to feel like the pace of progress towards next-gen consoles will quicken, and the game release calendar looks well stocked. However, a titan looms: Grand Theft Auto 6 is now slated for release in November after being originally planned for late 2025, and the whole gaming world is going to revolve around its arrival. Last year, I ended my contribution to this round-up by predicting a move away from fitness watches towards screenless trackers, such as a new WHOOP model, writes Matt Evans, Senior Editor, Fitness, Wellness & Wearables. Well, we got not one, but two new WHOOPs, and they were… fine. But, as prices rose, I found the ongoing subscription model far too expensive. However, my prediction that we’d move away from smartwatches hasn’t really been borne out. Wearable tech isn’t changing much in the mainstream, with the highest-profile releases being a slate of new watches from Garmin, Apple, Samsung, Google and OnePlus, and they’ve been as popular as ever. Look beyond those big releases, however, and interesting new stuff is out there. A subscription-free WHOOP competitor band was launched by Polar, while Core Devices, the resurrected Pebble watch company led by its original founder, unveiled a pair of watches inspired by the original Pebble designs, complete with low-power LCD-style screens, and open-source software that anyone with the know-how can tinker with. Core Devices also launched a new kind of smart ring with a button and a microphone, which the company says acts as “external memory for the brain”. Elsewhere, the AirPods Pro 3 now have built-in heart rate sensors, and Meta teamed up with Garmin to bring us the Oakley Meta Vanguard sports specs. Cool new wearable innovations are happening, but it all still feels quite fringe. My innovation of the year, however, came from Google. The Google Pixel Watch 4 is the first properly repairable smartwatch, as you’re able to take it apart and replace the battery and display. This enables you to change individual parts rather than the whole watch, reducing your contribution to e-waste, and saving you money in the long run. Almost every other piece of wearable tech from every other company is still a sealed unit that will ultimately end up being disposed of, and I hope Google's move could be the catalyst for change that the wasteful wearable tech industry sorely needs. The biggest story of 2025 broke late in the year, and it concerned off-screen studio machinations rather than on-screen drama. Netflix’s $82.7bn bid for Warner Bros. sent shockwaves through the industry when it was announced in early December, and provoked a counter-bid from Paramount Skydance. There’s still a long way to go before a deal is approved, but should Netflix acquire one of the film world’s most iconic studios it would be a landmark moment for the streaming sector, and would represent a seismic shift for the entertainment industry as a whole. Turning to the year's big theatrical releases, and numerous new movies flopped at the box office, including some with huge names attached (I’m looking at you, Dwayne Johnson and The Smashing Machine). Heck, with Captain America: Brave New World, Thunderbolts*, and The Fantastic Four: First Steps all underperforming, even the usually reliable Marvel Studios didn’t have a money-spinning hit on its hands. I wonder how many people predicted that animated and live-action/CGI hybrids would rule the theatrical roost, led by multi-billion dollar-spinning flicks like Lilo & Stitch, Zootopia 2, and Ne Zha II… As for the major streaming services, users endured more of the now-customary annual price hikes, while Max raised eyebrows by rebranding itself – again – to HBO Max. On the screen, unexpected hits such as HBO medical drama The Pitt, plus Netflix's ‘one-shot’ drama Adolescence and pop-culture phenomenon Kpop Demon Hunters, proved that not even the savviest industry exec can really be sure what viewers will latch onto. Add in the return of unmissable shows including Severance and Stranger Things amid the glut of great and not-so-great film and TV releases, and there was plenty to keep our eyeballs engaged. Now, what have you got in store for us, 2026? It's been a slow but not insignificant year in home technology as legacy brands scramble to keep pace with bigger, already tech-savvy players vying for their spot in our homes – whether that's Breville reinventing the toaster with a proprietary optical sensor, IKEA launching new renewable energy solutions, or Eufy and Dreame duking it out to give us the most effective stair-climbing robot vacuum.Some brands were less innovative than others though. Dyson left some of us feeling snubbed with its 'new' (read: decade-old) vacuum, while Shark's TurboBlade Cool + Heat failed to impress despite its noble attempt at mimicking other SharkNinja product's viral fame. Elsewhere we saw big plays from Amazon and Google in the smart home space, with the arrival of their AI-bolstered home assistants. Amazon's Alexa+ and Google's Gemini for Home both entered Early Access beta in the US, and while the early reviews for both have been mixed, it's a promising glimpse into the future of the connected home. Both of those services are subscription-based offerings, and subscriptions look set to become a major battleground for smart-home brands, and a bone of contention between brands and their customers, as companies attempt to lock users into their ecosystems, as we've already seen with video doorbells. Between that, and brands like Samsung using screen-loaded appliances as advertising billboards around the home, now might be a good time to really think about which brands you want want to invest in as you build your smart home.

Title: Beyond AI: 5 tech trends that will force you to pay more and rethink what’s ‘real’

When a friend and I recently got into a heated debate about artificial intelligence and its impact, I didn’t take sides. Instead, I countered his arguments with facts, even as he grew emotional and claimed that AI was the greatest enemy of humans. At the beginning of last year, I had already predicted that AI would be everywhere, and I was right. As a tech journalist, it comes naturally to me to observe key trends, anticipate the future, and form opinions. That said, it’s not my job to sell you something; influencers and YouTubers are already doing that very well. However, if AI defined 2025, this year is likely to be more decisive and unexpected, as artificial intelligence moves beyond chatbots and smartphones to create entirely new product categories — ones that had been teased for years but never truly materialised from a consumer perspective. But 2026 isn’t going to be about a single trend. It will be shaped by a mix of ideas, some of which may or may not work, but would stay and could shape the personal technology market and social media. I was scrolling through Instagram the other day when my eyes landed on a video featuring two babies engaging in playful banter (precisely the kind of content that gets maximum views in India) portrayed as a girlfriend and boyfriend. I must have watched a few of those short videos before realising they were generated by artificial intelligence, and only after paying close attention did I notice subtle changes that were barely visible without a side-by-side comparison. Since then, AI-generated videos have taken over my feed, especially clips of cartoony cats dancing to songs from Dhurandhar. I remember I joined Instagram (not officially, but through an invisible account) to watch videos of lion cubs, and now there are AI-generated versions of those videos as well, mostly funny and harmless. With platforms themselves encouraging AI videos, and tools like OpenAI’s Sora capable of generating videos of virtually anything in just a few minutes, millions of users will inevitably be fooled into thinking AI-generated videos are real. In India, hardly any such videos carry warning labels, making them almost indistinguishable from reality. That could pose a real problem, blurring the lines of what people can trust. This raises a serious question: it won’t be about whether you can tell the difference between what is real and what is not, but whether AI-generated videos change our relationships with other humans and affect how we perceive the world around us. The year has just begun, and I am already receiving feelers from my sources about an increase in smartphone and laptop prices, and it won’t be short-lived. The trend could continue for almost the entire year. For average buyers, phones already cost a month’s salary, and although many Indians purchase them on EMIs, ownership still comes at a hefty cost. Given the current shortage of memory chips, higher memory costs are likely to be passed on to consumers, which, in turn, will drive up the average selling prices of smartphones. This is primarily due to a shortage of memory chips, particularly dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), which is used in AI data centres and is also critical for smartphones. Lately, DRAM prices have surged as demand has outstripped supply, pushing up component costs. The biggest memory chip suppliers are prioritising data centre and AI companies that are flush with cash, and this shortage is expected to last until at least 2027. I am told that most smartphones launching early this year will be more expensive, though companies are likely to sweeten deals with tempting cashback offers and EMIs. I have also heard that smartphone prices, especially in the low- to mid-range segment, will rise once companies exhaust their existing stock. It is also possible for smartphone brands to launch phones with stripped-down RAM. Laptops, particularly gaming-focused models that are memory-hungry, may also see higher price tags. Enough of apps and the debate over whether to add a telephoto lens to a smartphone or how thin a phone can be. For 2026 and beyond, tech companies are pumped up to find ways to sell smart glasses for your face. While mixed-reality headsets never really took off and augmented reality glasses are still years away from becoming mainstream, in the immediate future (especially throughout this year) I foresee tech companies going all in on smart glasses, offering different capabilities such as small heads-up displays, AI features, built-in cameras, audio-only, and both tethered and wireless designs across varied price points, from mainstream and affordable to luxury. Meta has already proved that there is a market, even if still a tiny one, for smart glasses with its Ray-Ban and Oakley models. Others will follow suit and launch new smart glasses, ideally designed to be worn all day, every day. Just don’t expect smart glasses to replace your smartphone yet. However, tech companies are already plotting strategies to sell basic smart glasses that work as companions, much like your earbuds, smartwatch, or smart ring, and eventually reach a stage where they become as capable as a smartphone. Right now, whether you agree or not, smart glasses are exactly where feature phones once were, and it may take a long time before they become as advanced as modern smartphones. I may sound a bit futuristic, but this time I will take the side of Elon Musk. As the billionaire CEO has been saying for years, he envisions a world filled with humanoid robots. While that may not happen anytime soon, as mainstream adoption is still years away, there is growing interest among Silicon Valley companies and European startups in seriously considering humanoids as the next big thing. This also ties into how China has made humanoid robots a strategic priority in its tech battle with the US, though that’s a discussion for another day. For now, early investments in humanoids are likely to begin with experiments aimed at bringing home robots to consumers. Think of what Amazon did with Astro (a screen on wheels powered by the company’s Alexa voice software) a few years ago. The idea is to build robots with advanced cameras and computer vision software that can navigate homes much like self-driving cars. We will likely start hearing from the world’s biggest tech companies and consumer appliance makers about how they plan to bring AI-infused home robots as early as CES 2026, which takes place in Las Vegas in early January. Evidently, Apple is also interested in personal robotics, and is rumoured to be working on a tabletop AI companion described as an iPad on a movable robotic arm. It’s one space I am personally excited about, after seeing a humanoid robot in Shenzhen, China, last year. Let’s get it straight: foldables are an interesting product category, but I hardly see them as being very different from current smartphones. This may not sit well with many consumers, especially those who have invested in expensive foldables — I myself use a Pixel 10 Pro Fold and a Galaxy Z Fold 7. The main problem with foldables is the software, which, needless to say, holds them back and raises questions about whether the high price is justified. It’s definitely not the chunky, heavy build, an issue Samsung has largely solved or the price point, which Motorola has addressed more aggressively in recent years. Yes, the screen crease issue persists, and I hope it, too, gets resolved with the upcoming foldables. Personally, the user interface on foldables still underwhelms. I am pinning my hopes on Apple, which could finally solve the UI problem and improve how apps behave on a larger screen when it launches its first foldable this year – assuming the rumours turn out to be true. One way to address the software issue on a foldable iPhone would be to borrow elements from both iOS and iPadOS. It would be great to see desktop-grade apps that aren’t available on the iPhone, proper full-window multitasking, and optimal external display support on the iPhone Fold. That would be a dream iPhone for me, and I would be ready to leave my iPhone Air for it.

Title: Trump and the end of American hegemony

New York: It has become almost routine to end each year with talk of the “polycrisis,” and to acknowledge the difficulty of anticipating a future that seems pregnant with the risk of new wars, pandemics, financial crises, and climate-driven devastation. Yet 2025 added a uniquely toxic ingredient to this mix: the return to the White House of Donald Trump, whose erratic, unlawful policies have already upended the postwar era of globalization. Faced with so much chaos and uncertainty, can we say anything with confidence about where the US and global economies are heading? One thing we can say is that the US economy is not doing as well as Trump, ever the con man, would have us believe. Job creation is almost at a standstill, which is no surprise, given that Trump has been sowing uncertainty and weakening the economy in unprecedented ways. On the supply side, his most pernicious policy has been the frontal attack on immigrant workers (and American workers with darker complexions more broadly). The administration’s mass deportations—carried out by masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents snatching people off the streets—have killed off the most important source of additional labor supply at a time when the domestic labor force is declining. This matters for everyone, because not only do Americans depend on immigrants in industries ranging from agriculture and construction to hospitality and care work, but these immigrants are also a source of demand. Yet now, many Americans of color, even US citizens, are afraid to leave their homes, lest they be abducted and brutalized by ICE. The negative effects of Trump’s indiscriminate cuts to government have also spread throughout the economy. There are multiplier effects to government contractions, just as there are to expansions, and in the current context, the costs have been amplified by the erratic nature of the process. The administration’s incompetent, blunderbuss approach has sown even deeper uncertainty and induced precautionary behavior on the part of businesses and consumers. Trump’s tariffs—whether levied or threatened—and other on-again, off-again policies should be recognized for what they are: a major supply-side shock to the economy. They have pointlessly added uncertainty to the costs of production and to the prices consumers pay when they shop, making it impossible for businesses to engage in any serious long-term planning. And these are just short-term effects. The US economy’s long-term prospects look even bleaker, all thanks to Trump. After all, America’s comparative advantage has always rested on technology and unfettered higher education. By attacking research and trying to starve universities of federal funds unless they kowtow to his demands, Trump is shooting America’s economy in the foot. As numerous Nobel laureates in economics have emphasized, the “wealth of nations” lies in institutions, not least the rule of law. But Trump is trampling on the rule of law and replacing it with an extortionary regime of deal-making (and self-dealing), where government favors (like export licenses for Nvidia or subsidies for Intel) are granted in exchange for stakes in the company’s future profits. Of course, over time, Trump’s targets for extortion will dwindle. Having recognized the danger of relying on the United States, many countries are already pursuing new trade arrangements. Why, then, is GDP still growing (though not as robustly as it did under President Joe Biden), with the stock market reaching new highs and inflation remaining below the levels critics had warned about? There are multiple explanations for this apparent strength. With respect to the stock market, the boom is actually very narrow, confined largely to a handful of tech giants: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. And yet, these companies’ valuations reflect expectations of long-term monopoly profits that may never materialize. (This is especially true for Tesla, owing to Elon Musk’s embrace of Trump, which has alienated many consumers.) I am among the many commentators who see today’s valuations as the product of a bubble, one that has been sustaining not only the stock market but the entire economy. The massive capital expenditures on AI have been offsetting the weakness in the rest of the economy. But like all such bubbles, this one will eventually burst. Precisely when is anyone’s guess; but with so much of the economy riding on one sector, the collapse will inevitably be felt widely. Worse, if AI succeeds in the way its advocates anticipate, it would be a harbinger of other serious problems, because then the technology would likely displace many workers and cause even greater inequality. Add the downsizing of government demanded by Silicon Valley’s ersatz tech-libertarians, and one can only wonder what would sustain the US economy in the years ahead. As for inflation, there is a simple explanation for why it has not risen sharply yet. For starters, Trump’s tariffs generally have not been as high as he originally threatened (though the 50% punitive tariff imposed on India, a country the US had treated as a friend before Trump’s return, is shockingly brutal). Moreover, the effects of tariffs are often felt with long lags. Many firms refrained from raising prices until they saw what their competitors would do, and some won’t raise prices until the inventories of the goods they purchased before the tariffs are exhausted. But if Trump’s threatened tariffs against China were ever actually imposed, that would be a different matter. In fact, the unraveling of supply chains could unleash price increases greater than the tariffs themselves. That brings me to the critical question: What country would willingly subject itself to the whims of a mad king? It is not as if the US has a stranglehold on the supply of critical minerals or rare earths, without which the modern industrial age crumbles. It is not as if there aren’t markets elsewhere. The law of supply and demand works just as well without the US as with it. As Adam Smith and David Ricardo taught us, economic growth is about leveraging comparative advantages and economies of scale. But as Trump (and Russian President Vladimir Putin) has taught us, relying on unreliable trade partners can be enormously disadvantageous. Besides, the US is not as important as it used to be. It now accounts for under 10% of global exports. While some firms’ profits will suffer in a post-American global economy, others will benefit. While some workers will have to find alternative employment, others will find new demand for their skills. To be sure, the short run will not be easy. But in the new global economy that emerges over the longer term, America will have lost its hegemony. That is where we are heading as we head into the second year of living at the mercy of an unhinged president’s whims. The transition has already begun, and though global growth will suffer, the pain may be less than many fear. In Europe, for example, investments in rearmament—another byproduct of Trump’s self-destructive policies—will provide a major boost. Perhaps the defining moment will come with the 2026 US midterm elections in November. Elections that are not as free and fair as one would expect for a genuine democracy (as many fear) would mark a grim turning point. But if the growing dissatisfaction with Trump’s economic management and the country’s slide toward authoritarianism results in the Democrats recapturing at least one house of Congress, that will be a turning point in the other direction. Either way, the US and the world would still face at least another two years of economic incompetence and uncertainty. Joseph E.
