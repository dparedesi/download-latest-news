The company that ” knows everything about you” is going from strength to strength as war rises and and the so-called “liberal” West turns into a dystopian novel. Amid all the controversy generated by Trump’s $45 million birthday military parade on Sunday, with some claiming it was a giant flop while others insist it was a roaring success despite the low turnout, one thing appears to have been largely overlooked: Silicon Valley’s role in part-bankrolling the event. As The Verge reports, while taxpayers footed the bill for the soldiers, tanks, and planes at the parade, several major tech firms helped pay for the “festivities” along the parade route. They included Oracle, Amazon, Coinbase, Meta, all with close ties to the Trump administration, and Palantir, Silicon Valley’s darkest unicorn which aspires to one day operate the US government’s common operating system. A number of blue-chip sponsors also pitched in, such as Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram, Coca-Cola, Walmart, BNY, Goldman Sachs and Exiger. However, it was Palantir’s logo that was beaming from video boards above President Trump’s head. With soft rock guitar solos playing in the background and tanks rolling past the cheap-looking stage, accompanied by patrols of robot dogs, the scene had all the glamour and style of a low-budget Hollywood sci-fi from the mid-1980s. If Trump was looking to project a message of power to the world, it was a spectacular failure. But there was still plenty of menace on display. Parade announcer: "Special thanks to our sponsor, Palantir" pic.twitter.com/OKcsaDUB7X — FactPost (@factpostnews) June 14, 2025 Palantir said in an emailed statement on Sunday that the company “proudly supported yesterday’s celebration of the Army’s” 250th anniversary “alongside some of America’s greatest companies.” Palantir Joins the Army Palantir’s star is rising rapidly under Trump 2.0 while its shares hit record highs on an almost daily basis. The firm’s co-founder and chair of the board, Peter Thiel, was one of relatively few Silicon Valley moguls to bankroll Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, and now it looks like he’s cashing in. Thiel is also a former employer-cum-mentor of Vice President JD Vance, whose senate run in Ohio Thiel almost single handedly funded with a record breaking $15 million donation. In other words Thiel’s influence would probably be greater in a Vance administration. Palantir is involved in a new Pentagon initiative aimed at spurring innovation within the US army, titled Detachment 201. As Defense News reports, Shyam Sankar, Palantir’s chief technology officer, was one of four Silicon Valley tech execs invited to join the US Army Reserve as lieutenant colonel, to help inject their speed and expertise into the army’s military innovation. The other three Army Reserve lieutenant colonels were from Meta, Open AI and Thinking Machines Lab. Granted, Silicon Valley has always been closely intertwined with the MIC and the CIA, with many big-tech firms, including Palantir, receiving seed funding from the CIA’s investment arm, In-Q-Tel. But in the case of Palantir, the connections run deeper. The company essentially began life as an unofficial spin-off from DARPA’s Total Information Awareness (TIA) Program, which was ostensibly shut down in late 2003 when Congress decided that building a comprehensive surveillance program for all US citizens was perhaps a tad excessive, even in the post 9/11 era. In reality, TIA would serve as the prototype for sweeping surveillance programs later developed by the NSA, and exposed by whistleblower Edward Snowden. Meanwhile, Palantir was created, with CIA seed funding (like so many Silicon Valley firms), to be the privatised version of TIA. Now, its CTO has just enlisted in a new special corps within the US military. In an op-ed for the Free Press Project, Sankar notes that it would have been unthinkable for so many tech heavyweights to openly align with the US military just a decade ago: Equally, it would’ve been out of character for the military to enlist the support of the nation’s business elite — much less to create a special corps so that they could deploy their technical talents in service of the government. But a sea change has taken place in both places because of the urgency and seriousness of the moment. Wars in Europe and the Middle East and, above all, the threat of a war in the Pacific have focused the national mind and initiated a scramble for mobilization. Exploding pagers and long-distance drone strikes from shipping containers prove that technology has once again changed the battlefield. Our military has to change with it. As luck would have it, Palantir is a leading expert in exactly these kinds of technology. As leaked Los Angeles Police Department training documents revealed, its Gotham software collects and churns through huge reams of personal data, from gender, race, names, contact details, addresses, prior warrants, mugshots, surveillance photos, personal relationships, past and current employers, tattoos, scars, piercings and other identifying features. The company says its programs help users to spot hidden relationships and networks, uncover terrorist activity, and even predict attacks. The darker the world grows, the richer the pickings for this increasingly menacing (but still relatively little known) company. It wasn’t as if there weren’t warnings that this day — the day of peak Palantir — would come, even from some mainstream media outlets. In 2018, during Trump’s first term, Bloomberg published an in-depth piece titled: The subheading: Peter Thiel’s data-mining company is using War on Terror tools to track American citizens. The scary thing? Palantir is desperate for new customers. A couple of paragraphs: Founded in 2004 by Peter Thiel and some fellow PayPal alumni, Palantir cut its teeth working for the Pentagon and the CIA in Afghanistan and Iraq. The company’s engineers and products don’t do any spying themselves; they’re more like a spy’s brain, collecting and analyzing information that’s fed in from the hands, eyes, nose, and ears. The software combs through disparate data sources—financial documents, airline reservations, cellphone records, social media postings—and searches for connections that human analysts might miss. It then presents the linkages in colorful, easy-to-interpret graphics that look like spider webs. U.S. spies and special forces loved it immediately; they deployed Palantir to synthesize and sort the blizzard of battlefield intelligence. It helped planners avoid roadside bombs, track insurgents for assassination, even hunt down Osama bin Laden. The military success led to federal contracts on the civilian side. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services uses Palantir to detect Medicare fraud. The FBI uses it in criminal probes. The Department of Homeland Security deploys it to screen air travelers and keep tabs on immigrants. Police and sheriff’s departments in New York, New Orleans, Chicago, and Los Angeles have also used it, frequently ensnaring in the digital dragnet people who aren’t suspected of committing any crime. People and objects pop up on the Palantir screen inside boxes connected to other boxes by radiating lines labeled with the relationship: “Colleague of,” “Lives with,” “Operator of [cell number],” “Owner of [vehicle],” “Sibling of,” even “Lover of.” If the authorities have a picture, the rest is easy. Tapping databases of driver’s license and ID photos, law enforcement agencies can now identify more than half the population of U.S. adults. If Palantir knew everything about us in 2018, it presumably knows even more today, after purportedly participating in Elon Musk’s DOGE “clean-up” of government spending as well as an effort to build a new “mega API” for accessing Internal Revenue Service records. Palantir has also found new customers along the way, including an array of government departments, from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to NHS England, as well as banks, other tech firms, insurance providers, Wendy’s and a resurgent NATO. A company that aspires to be “in every missile (or drone)” and whose CEO, Alex Karp, openly brags about helping to kill “mainly terrorists”, has found fertile room for growth in both the US’ private healthcare industry and the UK’s publicly owned NHS. While two-thirds of its sales are still US-based, the company is rapidly expanding its overseas operations, particularly to the UK. As we noted a couple of months ago, the Trump and Starmer governments may differ wildly in terms of style, language and professed ideals, but they have some key things in common: Both are looking to transform their respective countries into AI powerhouses while also launching similar full-frontal assaults against basic democratic rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech and the right to protest. Both have launched brutal crackdowns on protests against Israel’s genocide of Gaza (and both are now fully behind Netanyahu’s reckless war on Iran). A Leading Financial Indicator for Dystopia and War In fact, one would be hard pressed to find a more reliable financial indicator for dystopia and war in the collective West than Palantir Technologies’ company stock. Note how the graph has steepened in recent months. In May, as the wars escalated in the Middle East and Eastern Europe and as ICE intensified its raids against undocumented workers, Palantir was the S&P 500’s top-performing company. Since Trump 2.0 took over in late January, the company’s shares have almost doubled. In the past year alone, they are up 470%. To put that in perspective, the S&P’s Aerospace & Defense Select Industry Index has offered returns of just 40% over the same time period. Granted, Palantir has one of the highest P/E ratios on the planet, at 617. The P/E ratio compares a company’s share price with its earnings per share, and is often used to determine the relative value of a company’s share in side-by-side comparisons. The fact that investors are willing to invest so much in a company that is still earning so little, relatively speaking, suggests they see a bright future ahead for the AI-empowered surveillance and control technologies that Palantir specialises in. In other words, they are going long on war overseas and repression at home. Palantir was already receiving shovel loads of contracts from governments, particularly in the US, the UK and Israel, long before Trump returned to office. In February 2022, Palantir was hired by the Biden administration to manage Covid vaccine distribution. A year later, it was awarded a $447 million contract to develop a federated data platform for the National Health Service. It now has 24 contracts with UK public institutions including the Ministry of Defence, the Police Force, the Cabinet Office, and the DLUHC. However, as Kit Klarenberg details for the Gray Zone, Trump 2.0 has massively expanded Palantir’s work with the US’ government sector, using the company’s tech to break down information silos within government, making it easier for agencies to share data on US residents: On May 30th, the New York Times published a lengthy probe linking these deals to an executive order signed by Trump in March, calling for seamless, mass sharing of data across government agencies through a Palantir application called Foundry. The report did not explain to readers how Palantir emerged as a small startup thanks to sponsorship from the CIA’s venture capital wing, In-Q-Tel, which gifted Peter Thiel’s company $2 million in 2004. Instead, the paper leaned in to a partisan angle playing on Democratic fears that Trump could abuse a unified database to target political foes. Nonetheless, the Times provided valuable insight into Palantir’s penetration of a vast array of US government agencies, by raking in more than $113 million in federal government spending since Trump took office, on top of “additional funds from existing contracts as well as new contracts with the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon.” In late May, the company’s existing contract with the Department of Defense was beefed up by $795 million, bringing it to an eye-popping total award of $1.3 billion. Palantir currently provides the Pentagon with AI targeting software known as Maven, which it uses in battlefields from Syria to Yemen to Ukraine and beyond. The contract will last until at least May 2029. The Trump administration’s fondness for Palantir has placed its data analytics and storage tool Foundry in at least four federal agencies, including the DHS and Health and Human Services Department. Talks are also apparently ongoing with the Social Security Administration and Internal Revenue Service to adopt the resource. This would facilitate merging all these agencies’ datasets. As we warned a couple of months ago, Palantir aspires to become the US and the UK governments’ central operating system by (in the words of its CTO, now a lieutenant colonel in the US army) expanding its “footprint across defence, healthcare and civilian agencies”: As outlandish as the idea may seem that one company could aspire to exclusively provide and manage a central operating system for the governments of both the US and the UK, there can be no doubting Palantir’s ambitions to expand its influence throughout government on both sides of the Atlantic. This is a company, after all, whose founder, Peter Thiel, has long marketed himself as a libertarian while lauding the benefits of monopoly capitalism and helping build the infrastructure of the modern surveillance state. As Iain Davis writes in his excellent two-part series on the “Dark MAGA Gov-Corp Technate”, the “proponents of Technocracy and the proponents of the Dark Enlightenment, such as Elon Musk and Thiel, are not interested in restricting state power, though they may say otherwise”: Instead they wish to move the state from the public to the private sector and expand its power once sufficiently privatized. True, they oppose “representative democracy” and characterise it as both a “democracy” (which it isn’t) and a bureaucratic system riddled with problems (which it is), but the solutions they offer, to all intents and purposes, magnify the power of the very state they supposedly condemn. What the believers in Technocracy and the believers in the Dark Enlightenment both propose are compartmentalised, hierarchical sociopolitical power structures that couldn’t be more state-like or more authoritarian. They seek to expand and maximise the power of the state, though in slightly different ways. Calling their new model of the state either a Technate (as technocrats do) or a gov-corp (as accelerationist neoreactionaries do) doesn’t change the nature of the tyrannical statism they desire to foist on the rest of us. Good vs Evil One of the most bizarre aspects of Palantir’s rise to dominance is its unflinching belief in a Manichean world order, and that everything it does, including helping the Israeli army build kill lists for the Israeli forces’ genocide in Gaza and helping the US deport undocumented migrants, is for the side of good. Thiel and Karp seem to genuinely believe they are in the vanguard of a revolution in both technology and governance — one that will save Western civilisation from external threats while transforming it into something very different, something much darker. Even back in 2010, it was clear what side Palantir was really on: Palantir was hired by Bank of America in 2010 to target WikiLeaks. Their plan, later leaked to WikiLeaks, included hacking, disinformation and smearing supporters including @ggreenwald. pic.twitter.com/Y1p0DkI3ER — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) June 11, 2025 In March, the company launched a recruitment campaign on university campuses with black billboards inviting students to join their mission “to ensure America’s future”, closing off with the words: “we build to dominate”. “We are dedicating our company to the service of the West and the United States of America,” Karp said during an investors call in February. “[We are] here to disrupt and.. when it’s necessary to scare enemies and, on occasion, kill them.” Karp also said that Palantir was “building really great things”, in order “to power the west to its obvious innate superiority”. Not everyone agrees. In the UK, for example, several senior officials at a number of NHS trusts have cautioned that Palantir’s technology was inferior to current systems, and could actually hamper NHS work. Palantir has always had an ace up its sleeve, however: the corrupting influence of revolving-door politics. In this sense, it is following the playbook of many of the blue-chip defence contractors it seeks to replace. As the FT reports, “Palantir is profiting from a ‘revolving door’ of executives and officials passing between the $264bn data intelligence company and high level positions in Washington and Westminster, creating an influence network who have guided its extraordinary growth.” Palantir is also active in one of the most secretive and influential forums of Western power politics: the Bilderberg Group. Thiel has long been a member of the group’s steering committee and was recently able to secure Karp a seat at the table. Granted, we will probably never know what was said at this year’s conflab, held last weekend at Stockholm’s Wallenberg-owned Grand Hotel, thanks to the private nature of the meeting and its use of the Chatham House Rule. But we do know what topics were under discussion thanks to a list provided by the organisers. They included the “transatlantic relationship”, “Ukraine”, “the US economy”, “depopulation and migration”, the “authoritarian axis”, and the Middle East, just a day after Israel launched an all-out offensive against Iran. This is a war that Palantir is also directly participating in, reports Klarenberg: For years, Palantir has been at the heart of US-led efforts to neutralize Iran’s alleged nuclear program. It has created a predictive analytical tool dubbed Mosaic for the purpose, used by the International Atomic Energy Agency and US officials to visualize ties between the people, places and material involved in the Islamic Republic’s nuclear activities. Data harvested and pored over by the resource includes potentially tainted material supposedly stolen from Tehran by Mossad. In a recent episode of System Update, Glenn Greenwald describes Palantir as having “an almost unprecedentedly influential role in America’s deep state and its intelligence apparatus and security state.” He notes how Karp* is becoming increasingly vocal about his belief system revealing himself to “be a hardcore neo-con, as devoted a loyalist to Israel as it gets,” and a firm believer in American war. Perhaps, just perhaps, Palantir’s coming out of the darkness in recent times will be its ultimate undoing. Otherwise, this may not be peak Palantir at all, but rather the beginning of its dominance of the government institutions and systems we partly all pay for. * While Greenwald focuses almost all his attention on Karp, describing him as the “sole controller and manager of Palantir,” he largely downplays the role of Palantir’s founder and current chair, Peter Thiel, describing it as “quite minimal”, which I believe is debatable. While Thiel no longer holds an executive role at Palantir, he is still chair of the board. It’s also worth bearing in mind that Thiel is one of the main shareholders of Rumble, the platform on which System Update is primarily hosted. For what it’s worth, JD Vance is also a major shareholder. This is a great article Nick, thank you. “Techno-feudalism.” “Techno-fascism.” “Authoritarian capitalism” (with a “techno” face). There are a lot of labels floating around for where we are headed. I wish the world of “dystopian” novels was not becoming reality so quickly. Thanks much for this. I’m not optimistic, but it’s much better to know what’s happening to us while it is still possible to obtain such information. I fear most of us are happily marching like lemmings into this world of infotainment soma, Brave New World style. But at some point the curtain to which Frank Zappa famously referred will be pulled back and we’ll be in 1984. The accelerating derangement of our political “leaders” makes me think that this could be soon, unless people wake up. That is one hell of an epilogue, or rather a punchline, in the footnote about Greenwald there. Just when you think you’re getting too cynical. Indeed. I have been watching some shows on Rumble so as not to give traffic to the evil tech overlords at Google/Alphabet. I didn’t realize Thiel was a shareholder at Rumble at all, and I do try to keep up. Thanks Nick for opening the aperture so people can peer through and see what the “future of the west” looks like from the perspective of the tech bro feudal lords. I, from my non-western perch, can only watch with mounting horror as the purveyors of death and mass surveillance sequester power at a rapid pace under Trump and his poodles Starmer, Metz et al. The shareholders of Palantir will make out like bandits as they continue their relentless assault on the liberties that westerners hold so dear while at the same time manufacturing external “enemies” around the world to justify the stock price. Scary stuff… Yes Nick, many thanks. Everyone is so focussed on the bad guys (Trump, Putin, Netanyahoo, Biden, ICE ……) they don’t realize what’s happening. I’m sharing this with liberal friends who marched against Trump over the weekend. I can only hope that the general public can shift its focus off of the NYT and onto the “real” news. One can hope. NC = real news. Thanks for this article. You wonder at what point that Palantir will change their name to the Umbrella Corporation. I get the impression that all this is predicated on more and more server farms opening up consuming energy and water like crazy so that all this work can get done. Of course in war time I think that they will find themselves vulnerable. In the meantime it looks like government are hiring them as hired guns who ask no questions. A country’s bureaucracy may question certain actions and may be examined in a public inquiry but a corporation like Palantir? Sorry, that privileged client-customer information. Our contract says that we cannot give you any answers – ever. Definitely if too many people start recognizing the name its time to change it Here is a very deep dive in Palantir and Military AI: https://www.projectcensored.org/silicon-valley-military-ai-weapons/ I’m not impressed with the gigo concerns in that linked article. Humans make tons of mistakes in war at all different levels of decision making, and enemies have been confusing each other forever. These AI and robot tools offer incredible war-fighting potential (incredible in the sense of effective killing and recon capability) and come with drawbacks, but obviously not sufficiently bad drawbacks to deter intense R&D. Putin awhile back said the Russians are treating AI as on par with nukes in terms of strategic impact. The US has a massive achilles heal because the gov’t tolerates a level of corruption that leads to massive military overspending and underperforming, which seems much less of a problem in Russia and china, relatively. But that’s a problem wholly independent of AI. Gifting top military rank to a bunch of nut-job Silicon Valley grifters — one of them born in Mumbai — on the eve of that Pyongyang-on-the-Potomac Army drag-show for Donny Bone-Spurs is simply more evidence of the Orwellian caste-based caudillismo into which America is sleep-walking. In the Panopticon to be run by the AI-educated minions of We Build to Dominate no one will be spared, even if you paid for one of their private club memberships. Karp’s murderous threat “to scare enemies and on occasion kill them” is nothing but a pseudo-intellectual beard on the End Times mentality of rationing and hoarding epitomized by Joseph Borrell’s notorious “most of the rest of the world is a jungle, and the jungle could invade the garden” quip. Tripoli, Raqqa, Bakhmut, Gaza, — next Tehran. Will your neighborhood be next? Man, so easy to unplug… Remember the 1990s, when nobody had a cellphone…? The lunatics have taken over the asylum, but can they build a new one to hold the rest of us? Palantir thinks so, but Palantir has been wrong rather often. Your email address will not be published.

Title: AppLovin Stock: Worth It At $365?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. The AppLovin Corporation logo appears on a smartphone screen in this illustration photo in Reno, ... More United States, on December 20, 2024. (Photo by Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images) AppLovin (NASDAQ:APP), a firm that assists mobile app developers in publishing and promoting their applications, has excelled over the past year, though it has experienced some ups and downs in 2025. While the stock dropped nearly 57% from the peaks observed in early February 2025 following a report from a short-seller claiming AppLovin violated service terms and exaggerated the success of its e-commerce operations, these claims have yet to be substantiated, and the stock saw a strong recovery after reporting solid earnings in the first quarter. The stock is currently approximately 7% up year-to-date in 2025 and has increased nearly 4.5x over the previous year. Demand for Axon 2.0, AppLovin’s exclusive machine learning algorithm for ad placement, has surged. The software effectively determines which ad to show, to which user, and at what time in order to optimize click-through rates or user engagement. While this resembles the strategies employed by Meta and Google, Axon is specifically designed for mobile app advertising. The company’s advertising platform reported impressive revenue growth of 71% year-over-year in Q1 2025, achieving $1.16 billion. Overall financial results have also been strong, with revenue soaring nearly 40% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA experiencing an increase close to 83%. Although the bulk of the company's revenue still comes from advertisements for mobile gaming applications, it is concentrating on expanding its e-commerce sector. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain how effective this initiative will be, as AppLovin possesses an extensive dataset in gaming but may lack the comprehensive first-party e-commerce data that competitors like Meta and Alphabet have. That being said, despite its impressive growth and success, the AppLovin stock may be a challenging choice at its current price of approximately $360. We believe there is little reason for concern regarding APP stock, which makes it appealing, but it is also very responsive to negative events due to its elevated valuation. We reached this conclusion by comparing APP’s current valuation with its operational performance over the past few years, as well as its current and historical financial positions. Our evaluation of AppLovin according to key metrics such as Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience indicates that the company possesses a very strong operational performance and financial standing, as elaborated below. Nonetheless, if you are looking for potential with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers a viable alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and delivered returns greater than 91% since its founding. Separately, see – Should You Buy CRWV Stock After A Whopping 4x Rise? Based on the amount you pay per dollar of sales or profit, APP stock appears to be very expensive relative to the overall market. • AppLovin has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 25.1 compared to a figure of 3.0 for the S&P 500 • Additionally, the company's price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) ratio stands at 50.8 compared to 20.5 for the S&P 500 • Furthermore, it has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 67.1 compared to the benchmark’s 26.4 AppLovin’s Revenues have substantially increased over the last few years. • AppLovin has experienced an average revenue growth rate of 23.2% over the last 3 years (versus an increase of 5.5% for the S&P 500) • Its revenues have risen 41.6% from $3.6 billion to $5.1 billion in the past 12 months (compared to a rise of 5.5% for the S&P 500) • Moreover, its quarterly revenues increased by 40.3% to $1.5 billion in the most recent quarter from $1.1 billion a year prior (versus a 4.8% increase for the S&P 500) AppLovin’s profit margins are significantly higher than most companies within the Trefis coverage universe. • AppLovin's Operating Income over the last four quarters was $2.4 billion, indicating a significantly high Operating Margin of 46.5% (compared to 13.2% for the S&P 500) • AppLovin's Operating Cash Flow (OCF) for this period was $2.5 billion, indicating a significantly high OCF Margin of 49.4% (versus 14.9% for the S&P 500) • For the last four-quarter span, AppLovin’s Net Income was $1.9 billion - reflecting a significantly high Net Income Margin of 37.4% (compared to 11.6% for the S&P 500) AppLovin’s balance sheet appears solid. • AppLovin reported a Debt figure of $3.7 billion at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $124 billion (as of 6/13/2025). This results in a very strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 2.9%(in contrast to 19.9% for the S&P 500). [Note: A low Debt-to-Equity Ratio is preferable] • Cash (including cash equivalents) constitutes $551 million of the $5.7 billion in Total Assets for AppLovin. This gives rise to a moderate Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 9.7% (in comparison to 13.8% for the S&P 500) APP stock has underperformed compared to the benchmark S&P 500 index during several recent downturns. While investors remain hopeful for a smooth economic adjustment in the U.S., the potential consequences of another recession could be severe. Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash illustrates the performance of key stocks during and after the last six market crashes. • APP stock declined 91.9% from a high of $114.85 on 11 November 2021 to $9.30 on 27 December 2022, compared to a peak-to-trough drop of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock completely rebounded to its pre-Crisis peak by 16 September 2024 • Since then, the stock has risen to a maximum of $510.13 on 17 February 2025 and currently trades at around $360 • APP stock dropped 36.7% from a high of $88.22 on 17 June 2021 to $55.88 on 16 August 2021, in comparison to a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock completely recovered to its pre-Crisis high by 14 October 2021 In conclusion, AppLovin’s performance across the parameters mentioned previously can be summarized as follows: • Growth: Extremely Strong • Profitability: Extremely Strong • Financial Stability: Very Strong • Downturn Resilience: Weak • Overall: Very Strong Therefore, despite its high valuation, the stock seems attractive yet volatile due to its poor downturn resilience. This leads us to affirm that APP is a challenging stock to purchase. Not satisfied with the volatility associated with APP stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which consists of 30 stocks, has demonstrated a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why is this the case? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; offering a smoother experience, as shown in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: The Crypto Yield Hunger Games Ahead This Stablecoin Summer

ByChristopher Perkins ByChristopher Perkins, Contributor. Two people help themselves to slices from a pie decorated with a dollar sign, 1979. (Photo by ... More Alfred Gescheidt/Getty Images) Stablecoins are having a moment. This spring, a flurry of stablecoin activity has taken global financial markets by storm and captured mainstream attention. Investors rushed into Circle’s 20-25x oversubscribed initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in May, immediately tripling the share price of the second largest stablecoin issuer. With a market capitalization of nearly $250 billion, stablecoins are on the verge of breaking out of the niche cryptocurrency markets and into the mainstream. In the right interest rate environment, stablecoins are yield-generating machines. On the surface, they are almost the perfect financial product. A depositor pays a stablecoin issuer cash, the issuer places deposits in yield-bearing, high quality assets, like U.S. Treasury bills, and returns the depositor a tokenized version of the currency. While holders are typically not entitled to a share of the interest, stablecoins unlock inexpensive, global and around-the-clock payments and remittances. For those in the developing world, dollar stablecoins often serve as a better store of value than the hyper-inflationary local currency. According to the Chainalysis 2024 Geography of Crypto Report, the top 10 nations with rapidly increasing crypto usage (including stablecoins) includes India, Nigeria, Indonesia, Philippines, Pakistan and Brazil. Nations with high inflation, like Venezuela, Argentina, and Turkey, also rank in the top 20. In the crypto industry, skilled practitioners—and now AI agents—deploy stablecoins to optimize yield across an array of decentralized finance strategies. It feels like a modern day gold rush. Tether was the first stablecoin to really strike gold. In 2024, it reaped $13 billion in profit with only a handful of employees. With profitability like that, it’s no surprise that companies are about to pour into the space. Big banks, including J.P. Morgan, Citi and Well Fargo, are talking about teaming up to launch a joint stablecoin. Walmart and Amazon are considering stablecoins of their own. Even Meta, which folded its Libra stablecoin amidst a tirade of regulatory backlash, has considered re-entering the space. In fact, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent testified that he expects stablecoins to drive $2 trillion in U.S. treasury bill demand in the near future. Regulatory clarity makes institutional adoption possible. This week, the Senate is expected to vote on the GENIUS Act, paving the way for stablecoin legislation. The bill requires reserves to be held in high-quality, liquid assets like Treasuries, imposes transparency requirements, and clarifies which institutions can issue dollar-backed digital tokens. However, it forbids any payment of interest to stablecoin holders. Traditional institutions, including the banks, have been waiting for this moment. At a Morgan Stanley conference in New York last week, Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America said, “We're working with the industry, working individually.” For many issuers, however, there will be a downside to regulatory clarity. “But the problem before was it wasn't clear we were allowed to do it under the banking regulations, ” Moynihan said, driving that point home. One of the great lessons learned from the global financial crisis is that regulation forces consolidation. Derivative markets serve as a good example. When the Dodd Frank Act required the clearing of the $700 trillion derivatives market, many believed that there would be a proliferation of clearing members. Instead, the opposite happened, and clearing members declined from 177 in 2004 to 64 in 2024. With regulation, costs increased and intense competition compressed fees. Similar dynamics are likely to play out in the stablecoin industry. The truth is that stablecoins are highly sensitive to short-term interest rates. Interest income accounts for 99% of Circle’s revenue, and they project that a 1% drop in interest rates could wipe out $441 million. While markets suggest that there is little chance of an interest rate cut this month, the future is less certain. And, while issuers do not pay individual holders interest, that does not mean that they keep it. According to its financial statements, Circle paid over $1 billion in distribution and transaction costs—over 50% of its revenue—for the privilege of reaching Coinbase’s 89 million registered users. As the next wave of players enter the space, many arrive with existing distribution. Citi alone boasts 200 million accounts. Companies with large, coveted distribution networks will charge handsomely for that access. Or, they become stablecoin issuers themselves. Just like gold rushes of the past, “picks and shovels” stand to benefit. Infrastructure that unlocks distribution and scales issuance will be in high demand. Stablecoin exchanges and platforms that enable “vampire” yield attacks, where competitor stablecoins are accepted, redeemed and re-issued by a new issuer will be in vogue. Issuers will ask, “Why should they have the interest when it could be mine?” Decentralized finance protocols will benefit as well. Without yield, U.S. dollar stablecoins, which account for 99% of issuance, depreciate due to inflation. So, holders will continue to seek yield elsewhere. Tokenized money markets, which pay interest and are regulated as securities, could also see explosive growth. Stablecoin summer has finally arrived. As stablecoin panacea turns into the yield version of the “Hunger Games,” it will be a period of intense competition and quest for scale. So, to the issuers, may the odds forever be in your favor.

European shares made cautious gains on Monday, with Gucci-owner Kering leading the pack following a leadership change. The news helped to break a five-day losing streak as investors pivot from the conflict in the Middle East. The pan-European STOXX 600 ended 0.4 per cent higher amid the developments. Dublin The Iseq All-Share index ended the session at 11,553.51, up 98.98 or 0.86 per cent on the previous close. It was a mixed day for the banks, Bank of Ireland rose 1.25 per cent to €12.115, and AIB Group increased its share price to €7.01, up 1.08 per cent. Despite these rises, Permanent TSB Group was a sectoral drag, falling 1.05 per cent to €1.88. Ryanair rose 1.85 per cent to €23.71, while fellow travel stock Irish Continental Group fell the furthest, down 1.50 per cent to €5.26. It was a good day for insulation and building materials specialist, Kingspan Group, who saw strong gains – rising 1.77 per cent to a share price of €77.45. Glanbia Plc fared well in trading on the day, ending up 1.04 per cent to €12.62, whereas Kerry Group fell €1.39 to €95.70. London London’s benchmark FTSE 100 rose on Monday, coming within spitting distance of a record high, after global risk appetite was boosted by reports Iran was seeking a truce with Israel. The blue-chip FTSE 100 closed up 0.3 per centat 8,875.22 points, and came within a couple of points of its intraday record high of 8,908.74 points on March 3. The midcap FTSE 250 gained 0.5 per cent. Ladbrokes owner Entain jumped 15.3 per cent, the stock’s biggest percentage gain since September 2021, after its US sports-betting joint venture, BetMGM, raised its annual revenue and core earnings forecast. The travel and leisure subindex surged 3.3 per cent. In London, Metro Bank Holdings hit a more than two-year high and led gains on the midcap index after a report of takeover approach from private equity firm Pollen Street Capital. Shares of the British lender were up 18.4 per cent The precious metal miners’ subindex fell the most among sectors, down 3 per cent tracking lower gold prices. Europe European shares climbed on Monday, recouping some of last week’s losses as Kering soared after the luxury group announced a chief executive (CEO) change and investors shifted their focus from the conflict in the Middle East that drove a sell-off last week. On a sectoral basis, Heavyweight banks were the biggest boost, advancing 1.9 per cent Gucci parent Kering jumped 11.8 per cent, among the top percentage gainers on the STOXX after the luxury conglomerate said it was hiring Renault boss Luca de Meoas to be its new CEO, confirming reports from earlier in the day. Shares of the French automaker closed 8.7 per cent lower. A separate report said Tokyo’s Nissan planned to reduce its stake in Renault. On the downside, healthcare stocks lagged as Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk fell 3.5 per cent. New York US stock indexes had risen in midafternoon trading on Monday as oil prices fell after the Israel-Iran attacks left crude production and exports unaffected, allaying investor concerns in advance of a central bank policy meeting. Crude prices retreated more than 3 per cent on reports that Iran is seeking an end to hostilities with Israel, raising the possibility of a truce and easing fears of a disruption to crude supplies from the region. Oil prices surged more than 7 per cent on Friday after Israel began bombing Iran. Most megacap and growth stocks rose. Meta advanced after announcing on plans to roll out new WhatsApp updates over the next few months and Nvidia was also up. UPS and FedEx edged up after the Trump Organisation launched a self-branded mobile network, dubbed Trump Mobile, and named the companies as shipping partners. Shares of Sarepta Therapeutics plunged nearly half after the company disclosed a second case of a patient dying due to acute liver failure after receiving its gene therapy for a rare form of muscular dystrophy. US Steel rose significantly after Trump approved Nippon Steel’s $14.9 billion (€12.8 billion) bid for the company. Cisco gained after Deutsche Bank upgraded the communications equipment maker to “buy” from “hold”.– Additional reporting, Reuters, PA.

Title: Sincerity Wins the War
URL: https://www.wheresyoured.at/sic/
Time Published: 2025-06-16T16:45:56Z
Full Content:
Hello Where’s Your Ed At Subscribers! I’ve started a premium version of this newsletter with a weekly Friday column where I go over the most meaningful news and give my views, which I guess is what you’d expect. Anyway, it’s $7 a month or $70 a year, and helps support the newsletter. I will continue to do my big free column too! Thanks. What wins the war is sincerity. What wins the war is accountability. And we do not have to buy into the inevitability of this movement. Nor do we have to cover it in the way it has always been covered. Why not mix emotion and honesty with business reporting? Why not pry apart the narrative as you tell the story rather than hoping the audience works it out? Forget “hanging them with their own rope” — describe what’s happening and hold these people accountable in the way you would be held accountable at your job. Your job is not to report “the facts” and let the readers work it out. To quote my buddy Kasey, if you're not reporting the context, you're not reporting the story. Facts without context aren’t really facts. Blandly repeating what an executive or politician says and thinking that appending it with “...said [person]” is sufficient to communicate their biases or intentions isn’t just irresponsible, it’s actively rejecting your position as a journalist. You don’t even have to say somebody is lying when they say they’re going to do something — but the word “allegedly” is powerful, reasonable and honest, and is an objective way of calling into question a narrative. Let me give you a few examples. A few weeks ago, multiple outlets reported that Meta would partner with Anduril, the military contractor founded by Palmer Luckey, the former founder of VR company Oculus whichMeta acquired in 2014, only to oust Luckey four years later for donating $10,000 to an anti-Hilary Clinton group. In 2024, Meta CTO Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, famous for saying that Facebook’s growth is necessary and good, even if it leads to bad things like cyberbullying and terror attacks, publicly apologized to Luckey. Now the circle is completing, with Luckey sort-of-returning to Meta to work with the company on some sort of helmet called “Eagle Eye.” One might think at this point the media would be a little more hesitant in how they cover anything Zuckerberg-related after he completely lied to them about the metaverse, and one would be wrong. The Washington Post reported that, and I quote: To aid the collaboration, Meta will draw on its hefty investments in AI models known as Llama and its virtual reality division, Reality Labs. The company has built several iterations of immersive headsets aimed at blending the physical and virtual worlds — a concept known as the metaverse. Are you fucking kidding me? The metaverse was a joke! It never existed! Meta bought a company that made VR headsets — a technology so old, they featured in an episode of Murder She Wrote — and an online game that could best be described as “Second Life, but sadder.” Here’s a piece from the Washington Post agreeing with me! The metaverse never really had a product of any kind, and lost tens of billions of dollars for no reason! Here’s a whole thing I wrote about it years ago! To still bring up the metaverse in the year of our lord 2025 is ridiculous! But even putting that aside… wait, Meta’s going to put its AI inside of this headset? Palmer Luckey claims that, according to the Post, this headset will be “combining an AI assistant with communications and other functions.” Llama? That assistant? You mean the one that it had to rig to cheat on LLM benchmarking tests? The one that will, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, participate in vivid and gratuitous sexual fantasies with children? The one using generative AI models that hallucinate, like every other LLM? That’s the one that you’re gonna put in the helmet for the military? How is the helmet going to do that exactly? What will an LLM — an inconsistent and unreliable generative AI system — do in a combat situation, and will a soldier trust it again after its first fuckup? Just to be clear, and I quote Palmer Luckey, the helmet that will feature an “ever-present companion who can operate systems, who can communicate with others, who you can off-load tasks onto … that is looking out for you with more eyes than you could ever look out for yourself right there right there in your helmet.” This is all going to be powered by Llama? Really? Are we all really going to accept that? Does nobody actually think about the words they’re writing down? Here’s the thing about military tech: the US DOD tends to be fairly conservative when it comes to the software it uses, and has high requirements for reliability and safety. I could talk about these for hours — from coding guidelines, to the ADA programming language, which was designed to be highly crash-resistant and powers everything from guided missiles to F-15 fighter jet — but suffice it to say that it’s highly doubtful that the military is going to rely on an LLM that hallucinates a significant portion of the time. To be clear, I’m not saying we have to reject every single announcement that comes along, but can we just for one second think critically about what it is we are writing down. We do not have to buy into every narrative, nor do we have to report it as if we do so. We do not have to accept anything based on the fact someone says it emphatically, or because they throw a number at us to make it sound respectable. Here’s another example. A few weeks ago, Axios had a miniature shitfit after Anthropic CEO said that “AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and spike unemployment to 10-20% in the next one to five years.” What data did Mr. Amodei use to make this point? Who knows! Axios simply accepted that he said something and wrote it down, because why think when you could write. This is extremely stupid! This is so unbelievably stupid that it makes me question the intelligence of literally anybody that quotes it! Dario Amodei provided no sourcing, no data, nothing other than a vibes-based fib specifically engineered to alarm hapless journalists. Amodei hasn’t done any kind of study or research. He’s just saying stuff, and that’s all it takes to get a headline when you’re the CEO of one of the top two big AI companies. It is, by the way, easy to cover this ethically, as proven by Allison Morrow of CNN, who, engaging her critical thinking, correctly stated that “Amodei didn’t cite any research or evidence for that 50% estimate,” that “Amodei is a salesman, and it’s in his interest to make his product appear inevitable and so powerful it’s scary,” and that “little of what Amodei told Axios was new, but it was calibrated to sound just outrageous enough to draw attention to Anthropic’s work.” Morrow’s work is compelling because it’s sincere, and is proof that there is absolutely nothing stopping mainstream press from covering this industry honestly. Instead, Business Insider (which just laid off a ton of people and lazily recommended their workers read books that don’t exist because they can’t even write their own emails without AI), Fortune, Mashable and many other outlets blandly covered a man’s completely made up figure as if it was fact. This isn’t a story. It is “guy said thing,” and “guy” happens to be “billionaire behind multi-billion dollar Large Language Model company,” and said company has made exactly jack shit as far as software that can actually replace workers. While there are absolutely some jobs being taken by AI, there is, to this point, little or no research that suggests that it’s happening at scale, mostly because Large Language Models don’t really do the things that you need them to do to take someone’s job at scale. Nor is it clear that those jobs were lost because AI — specifically genAI — can actually do them as well, or better, than a person, or because an imbecile CEO bought into the hype and decided to fire up the pink slip printer, and when those LLMs inevitably shit the bed, those people will be hired back. You know, like Klarna literally just had to. These scare tactics exist to do one thing: increase the value of companies like Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft, Salesforce, and anybody else outright lying about how “agents” will do our jobs, and to make it easier for the startups making these models to raise funds, kind-of how a pump-and-dump scammer will hype up a doomed penny stock by saying how it’s going to the moon, not disclosing that they themselves own a stake in the business. Let’s look at another example. A recent report from Oxford Economics talked about how entry-level workers were facing a job crisis, and vaguely mentioned in the preview of the report that “there are signs that entry-level positions are being displaced by artificial intelligence at higher rates.” One might think the report says much more than that, and one would be wrong. On the very first page, it says that “there are signs that entry-level positions are being displaced by artificial intelligence at higher rates.” On page 3, it claims that the “high adoption rate by information companies along with the sheer employment declines in [some roles] since 2022 suggested some displacement effect from AI…[and] digging deeper, the largest displacement seems to be entry-level jobs normally filled by recent graduates.” In fact, fuck it, take a look. That’s it! That’s the entire extent of its proof! The argument is that because companies are getting AI software and there’s employment declines, it must be AI. There you go! Case closed. This report has now been quoted as gospel. Axios claimed that Oxford Economics’ report provided “hard evidence” that “AI is displacing white-collar workers.” USA Today said that positions in computer and mathematical sciences have been the first affected as companies increasingly adopt artificial intelligence systems.” And Anthropic marketing intern/New York Times columnist Kevin Roose claimed that this was only the tip of the iceberg, because, and I shit you not, he had talked to some guys who said some stuff. No, really. Yet Roose’s most egregious bullshit came after he admitted that these don’t prove anything: That’s right, anecdotes don’t prove his point, but what if other anecdotes proved his point? Because Roose goes on to quote Amodei’s 50% quote, and say that they now claim its Claude Opus 4 model can “code for several hours without stopping,” a statement that Roose calls “a tantalizing possibility if you’re a company accustomed to paying six-figure engineer salaries for that kind of productivity” without thinking “does that mean the code is good?” or “what does it do for those hours?” Roose spends the rest of the article clearing his throat, adding that “even if AI doesn’t take all entry-level jobs right away” that “two trends concern [him],” namely that he worries companies are “turning to AI too early, before the tools are robust enough to handle full entry-level workloads,” and that executives believing that entry-level jobs are short-lived will “underinvest in job training, mentorship and other programs aimed at entry-level workers.” Kevin, have you ever considered checking whether that actually happens? Nah! Why would he? Kevin’s job is to be a greasy pawn of the AI industry and the markets at large. An interesting — and sincere! — version of this piece would’ve intelligently humoured the idea then attempted to actually prove it, and then failed because there is no proof that this is actually happening other than that which the media drums up. It’s the same craven, insincere crap we saw with the return to office “debate” which was far more about bosses pretending that the office was good than it was about productivity or any kind of work. I wrote about this almost every week for several years, and every single media outlet participated, on some level, in pushing a completely fictitious world where in-office work was “better” due to ‘serendipity,” that the boss was right, and that we all had to come back to the office. Did they check with the boss about how often they were in the office? Nope! Did they give equal weight to those who disagreed with management — namely those doing the actual work? No. But they did get really concerned about quiet quitting for some reason, even though it wasn’t real, because the bosses that don’t seem to actually do any work had demanded that it was. This is the same thing that happened when corporations were raising prices and the media steadfastly claimed that inflation had nothing to do with corporate greed (once again, CNN’s Allison Morrow was one of the few mainstream media reporters willing to just say “yeah corporations actually are raising prices and blaming it on inflation”), desperately clinging to whatever flimsy data might prove that corporations weren’t price gouging even as corporations talked about doing so publicly. It’s all so deeply insincere, and all so deeply ugly — a view from nowhere, one that seeks not to tell anyone anything other than that whatever the rich or powerful is worried or excited about is true, and that the evidence, no matter how flimsy, always points in the way they want it to. It’s lazy, brainless, and suggests either a complete rot in the top of editorial across the entire business and tech media or a consistent failure by writers to do basic journalism, and as forgiving I want to be, there are enough of these egregious issues that I have to begin asking if anybody is actually fucking trying. It’s the same thing every time the powerful have an idea — remote work is bad for companies and we must return to the office, the metaverse is here and we’re all gonna work in it, prices are higher and it’s due to inflation rather than anything else, AI is so powerful and strong and will take all of our jobs, or whatever it is — and that idea immediately become the media’s talking points. Real people in the real world, experiencing a different reality, watch as the media repeatedly tells them that their own experiences are wrong. Companies can raise their prices specifically to raise their profits, Meta can literally not make a metaverse, AI can do very little to actually automate your real job, and the media will still tell you to shut the fuck up and eat their truth-slop. You want an actual conspiracy theory? How about a real one: that the media works together with the rich and powerful to directly craft “the truth,” even if it runs contrary to reality. The Business Idiots that rule our economy — work-shy executives and investors with no real connection to any kind of actual production — are the true architects of what’s “real” in our world, and their demands are simple: “make the news read like we want it to.” Yet when I say “works together,” I don’t even mean that they get together in a big room and agree on what’s going to be said. Editors — and writers — eagerly await the chance to write something following a trend or a concept that their bosses (or other writers’ bosses) come up with and are ready to go. I don’t want to pillory too many people here, but go and look at who covered the metaverse, cryptocurrency, remote work, NFTs and now generative AI in gushing terms. Okay, but seriously, how is it every time with Casey and Kevin? The illuminati doesn’t need to exist. We don’t need to talk about the Bilderberg Group, or Skull and Bones, or reptilians, or wheel out David Icke and his turquoise shellsuit. The media has become more than willing to follow whatever it needs to once everybody agrees on the latest fad or campaign, to the point that they’ll repeat nonsensical claim after nonsensical claim. The cycle repeats because our society — and yes, our editorial class too — is controlled by people who don’t actually interact with it. They have beliefs that they want affirmed, ideas that they want spread, and they don’t even need to work that hard to do so, because the editorial rails are already in place to accept whatever the next big idea is. They’ve created editorial class structures to make sure writers will only write what’s assigned, pushing back on anything that steps too far out of everybody’s agreed-upon comfort zone. The “AI is going to eliminate half of white collar jobs” story is one that’s taken hold because it gets clicks and appeals to a fear that everyone, particularly those in the knowledge economy who have long enjoyed protection from automation, has. Nobody wants to be destitute. Nobody with six figures of college debt wants to be stood in a dole queue. It’s a sexy headline, one that scares the reader into clicking, and when you’re doing a half-assed job at covering a study, you can very easily just say “there’s evidence this is happening.” It’s scary. People are scared, and want to know more about the scary subject, so reporters keep covering it again and again, repeating a blatant lie sourced using flimsy data, pandering to those fears rather than addressing them with reality. It feels like the easiest way to push back on these stories is fairly simple: ask reporters to show the companies that have actually done this. No, I don’t mean “show me a company that did layoffs and claims they’re bringing in new efficiencies with AI.” I mean actually show me a company that has laid off, say, 10 people, and how those people have been replaced by AI. What does the AI do? How does it work? How do you quantify the work it’s replaced? How does it compare in quality? Surely with all these headlines there’s got to be one company that can show you, right? No, no, I really don’t mean “we’re saying this is the reason,” I mean show me the actual job replacement happening and how it works. We’re three years in and we’ve got headlines talking about AI replacing jobs. Where? Christopher Mims of the Wall Street Journal had a story from June 2024 that talked about freelance copy editors and concept artists being replaced by generative AI, but I can find no stories about companies replacing employees. To be clear, I am not advocating for this to happen. I am simply asking that the media, which seems obsessed with — even excited by — the prospect of imminent large-scale job loss, goes out and finds a business (not a freelancer who has lost work, not a company that has laid people off with a statement about AI) that has replaced workers with generative AI. They can’t, because it isn’t happening at scale, because generative AI does not have the capabilities that people like Dario Amodei and Sam Altman repeatedly act like they do, yet the media continues to prop up the story because they don’t have the basic fucking curiosity to learn about what they’re talking about. Hell, I’ll make it easier for you. Why don’t you find me the product, the actual thing, that can do someone’s job? Can you replace an accountant? No. A doctor? No. A writer? Not if you want good writing. An artist? Not if you want to actually copyright the artwork, and that’s before you get to how weird and soulless the art itself feels. Walk into your place of work tomorrow and look around you and start telling me how you would replace each and every person in there with the technology that exists today, not the imaginary stuff that Dario Amodei and Sam Altman want you to think about. Outside of coding — which, by the way, is not the majority of a software engineer’s fucking job, if you’d take the god damn time to actually talk to one! — what are the actual capabilities of a Large Language Model today? What can it actually do? You’re gonna say “it can do deep research,” by which you mean a product that doesn’t really work. What else? Generate videos that sometimes look okay? “Vibe code”? Bet you’re gonna say something about AI being used in the sciences to “discover new materials” which proved AI’s productivity benefits. Well, MIT announced that it has “no confidence in the provenance, reliability or validity of the data, and [has] no confidence in the validity of the research contained in the paper.” I’m not even being facetious: show me something! Show me something that actually matters. Show me the thing that will replace white collar workers — or even, honestly, “reduce the need for them.” Find me someone who said “with a tool like this I won’t need this many people” who actually fired them and then replaced them with the tool and the business keeps functioning. Then find me two or three more. Actually, make it ten, because this is apparently replacing half the white collar workforce. There are some answers, by the way. Generative AI has sped up transcription and translation, which are useful for quick references but can cause genuine legal risk. Generative AI-based video editing tools are gaining in popularity, though it’s unclear by how much. Seemingly every app that connects to generative AI can summarise a message. Software engineers using LLM tools — as I talked about on a recent episode of Better Offline — are finding some advantages, but LLMs are far from a panacea. Generative AI chatbots are driving people insane by providing them an endlessly-configurable pseudo-conversation too, though that’s less of a “use case” and more of a “text-based video game launched at scale without anybody thinking about what might happen.” Let’s be real: none of this is transformative. None of this is futuristic. It’s stuff we already do, done faster, though “faster” doesn’t mean better, or even that the task is done properly, and obviously, it doesn’t mean removing the human from the picture. Generative AI is best at, it seems, doing very specific things in a very generic way, none of which are truly life-changing. Yet that’s how the media discusses it. Seriously, put aside the money, the hype, the pressure, the media campaigns, the emotions you have, everything, and just focus on the product as it is today. What is it that generative AI does, today, for you? Don’t say “AI could” or “AI will,” tell me what “AI does.” Tell me what has changed about your life, your job, your friends’ jobs, or the world around you, other than that you heard a bunch of people got rich. Yet the media continually calls it “powerful AI.” Powerful how? Explain the power! What is the power? The word “powerful” is a marketing term that the media has adopted to describe something it doesn’t understand, along with the word “agent,” which means “autonomous AI that can do things for you” but is used, at this point, to describe any Large Language Model doing anything. But the intention is to frame these models as “powerful” and to use the term “agents” to make this technology seem bigger than it is, and the people that control those terms are the AI companies themselves. It’s at best lazy and at worst actively deceitful, a failure of modern journalism to successfully describe the moment outside of what they’re told to, or the “industry standards” they accept, such as “a Large Language Model is powerful and whatever Anthropic or OpenAI tells me is true.” It’s a disgrace, and I believe it either creates distrust in the media or drives people insane as they look at reality - where generative AI doesn’t really seem to be doing much - and get told something entirely different by the media. When I read a lot of modern journalism, I genuinely wonder what it is the reporter wants to convey. A thought? A narrative? A story? Some sort of regurgitated version of “the truth” as justified by what everybody else is writing and how your editor feels, or what the markets are currently interested in? What is it that writers want readers to come away with, exactly? It reminds me a lot of a term that Defector’s David Roth once used to describe CNN’s Chris Cilizza — “politics, noticed”: Whether Roth would agree or not, I believe that this paragraph applies to a great deal of modern journalism. Oh! Anthropic launched a new model! Delightful. What does it do? Oh they told me, great, I can write it down. It’s even better at coding now! Wow! Also, Anthropic’s CEO said something, which I will also write down. The end! I’ll be blunt: making no attempt to give actual context or scale or consideration to the larger meaning of the things said makes the purpose of journalism moot. Business and tech journalism has become “technology, noticed.” While there are forays out of this cul-de-sac of credulity — and exceptions at many mainstream outlets — there are so many more people who will simply hear that there’s a guy who said a thing, and that guy is rich and runs a company people respect, and thus that statement is now news to be reported without commentary or consideration. Much of this can be blamed on the editorial upper crust that continually refuses to let writers critique their subject matter, and wants to “play it safe” by basically doing what everybody else does. What’s crazy to me is that many of the problems with the AI bubble — as with the metaverse, as with the return to office, as with inflation and price gouging — are obvious if you actually use the things or participate in reality, but such things do not always fit with the editorial message. But honestly, there are plenty of writers who just don’t give a shit. They don’t really care to find out what AI can (or can’t) do. They’ve come to their conclusion (it’s powerful, inevitable, and already doing amazing things) and thus will write from that perspective. It’s actually pretty nefarious to continually refer to this stuff as “powerful,” because you know their public justification is how this stuff uses a bunch of GPUs, and you know their private justification is that they have never checked and don’t really care to. It’s much easier to follow the pack, because everybody “needs to cover AI” and AI stories, I assume, get clicks. That, and their bosses, who don’t really know anything other than that “AI will be big,” don’t want to see anything else. Why argue with the powerful? They have all the money. But even then…can you try using it? Or talking to people that use it? Not “AI experts” or “AI scientists,” but real people in the real world? Talk to some of those software engineers! Or I dunno, learn about LLMs yourself and try them out? Ultimately, a business or tech reporter should ask themselves: what is your job? Who do you serve? It’s perfectly fine to write relatively straightforward and positive stuff, but you have to be clear that that’s what you’re doing and why you’re doing it. And you know what, if all you want to do is report what a company does, fine! I have no problem with that, but at least report it truthfully. If you’re going to do an opinion piece suggesting that AI will take our jobs, at least live in reality, and put even the smallest amount of thought into what you’re saying and what it actually means. This isn’t even about opinion or ideology, this is basic fucking work. And it is fundamentally insincere. Is any of this what you truly believe? Do you know what you believe? I don’t mean this as a judgment or an attack — many people go through their whole lives with relatively flimsy reasons for the things they believe, especially in the case of commonly-held beliefs like “AI is going to be big” or “Meta is a successful company.” If I’m honest, I really don’t mind if you don’t agree with something I say, as long as you have a fundamentally-sound reason for doing so. My CoreWeave analysis may seem silly to some because its value has quadrupled — and that’s why I didn’t write that I believed the stock would crater, or really anything about the stock. Its success does not say much about the AI bubble other than it continues, and even if I am wrong, somehow, long term, at least I was wrong for reasons I could argue versus the general purpose sense that “AI is the biggest thing ever.” I understand formats can be constraining — many outlets demand an objective tone — but this is where words like “allegedly” come in. For example, The Wall Street Journal recently said that Sam Altman had claimed, in a leaked recording, that buying Jony Ive’s pre-product hardware startup would add “$1 trillion in market value” to OpenAI. As it stands, a reader — especially a Business Idiot — could be forgiven for thinking that OpenAI was now worth, or could be worth, over a trillion dollars, which is an egregious editorial failure. One could easily add that “...to this date, there have been no consumer hardware launches at this scale outside of major manufacturers like Apple and Google, and these companies had significantly larger research and development budgets and already-existent infrastructure relationships that OpenAI lacks.” Nothing about what I just said is opinion. Nothing about what I just said is an attack, or a sleight, and if you think it’s “undermining” the story, you yourself are not thinking objectively. These are all true statements, and are necessary to give the full context of the story. That, to me, is sincerity. Constrained by an entirely objective format, a reporter makes the effort to get across the context in which a story is happening, rather than just reporting exactly the story and what the company has said about it. By not including the context, you are, on some level, not being objective: you are saying that everything that’s happening here isn’t just possible, but rational, despite the ridiculous nature of Altman’s comment. Note that these are subjective statements. They are also the implication of simply stating that Sam Altman believes acquiring Jony Ive’s company will add $1 trillion dollars in value to OpenAI. By not saying how unlikely it is — again, without even saying the word “unlikely,” but allowing the audience to come to that conclusion by having the whole story — you give the audience the truth. It really is that simple. The problem, ultimately, is that everybody is aware that they’re being constantly conned, but they can’t always see where and why. Their news oscillates from aggressively dogmatic to a kind of sludge-like objectivity, and oftentimes feels entirely disconnected from their own experiences other than in the most tangential sense, giving them the feeling that their actual lives don’t really matter to the world at large. On top of that, the basic experience of interacting with technology, if not the world at large, kind of fucking sucks now. We go on Instagram or Facebook to see our friends and battle through a few ads and recommended content, we see things from days ago until we click stories, and we hammer past a few more ads to get a few glimpses of our friends. We log onto Microsoft Teams, it takes a few seconds to go through after each click, and then it asks why we’re not logged in, a thing that we don’t need to be able to do to make a video call. Our email accounts are clogged with legal spam — marketing missives, newsletters, summaries from news outlets, notifications from UPS that require us to log in, notifications that our data has been leaked, payment reminders, receipts, and even occasionally emails from real people. Google Search is broken, but then again, so is searching on basically any platform, be it our emails, workspaces or social networks. At scale, we as human beings are continually reminded that we do not matter, that any experiences of ours outside of what the news say makes us “different” or a “cynic,” that our pain points are only as relevant as those that match recent studies or reports, and that the people that actually matter are either the powerful or considered worthy of attention. News rarely feels like it appeals to the listener, reader or viewer, just an amorphous generalized “thing” of a person imagined in the mind of a Business Idiot. The news doesn’t feel the need to explain why AI is powerful, just that it is, in the same way that “we all knew” that being back in the office was better, even if there were far more people who disagreed than didn’t. As a result of all of these things, people are desperate for sincerity. They’re desperate to be talked to as human beings, their struggles validated, their pain points confronted and taken seriously. They’re desperate to have things explained to them with clarity, and to have it done by somebody who doesn’t feel chained by an outlet. This is something that right wing media caught onto and exploited, leading to the rise of Donald Trump and the obsession with creating the “Joe Rogan of the Left,” an inherently ridiculous position based on his own popularity with young men (which is questionable based on recent reports) and its total misunderstanding of what actually makes his kind of media popular. However you may feel about Rogan, what his show sells on is that he’s a kind of sincere, pliant and amicable oaf. He does not seem condescending or judgmental to his audience, because he himself sits, slack-jawed, saying “yeah I knew a guy who did that” and genuinely seems to like them. While you (as I do) may deeply dislike everything on that show, you can’t deny that they seem to at least enjoy themselves, or feel engaged and accepted. The same goes for Theo Von (real name: Theodor Capitani von Kurnatowski III, and no, really!), whose whole affable doofus motif disarms guests and listeners. It works! And he’s got a whole machine that supports him, just like Rogan, money, real promotion, and real production value. They are given the bankroll and the resources to make a high-end production and a studio space and infrastructural support and then they get a bunch of marketing and social push too. There’s entire operations behind them, other than the literal stuff they do on the set, because, shocker, the audience actually wants to see them not have a boxed lunch with “THE THINGS TO BELIEVE” written on it by a management consultant. This is in no way a political statement, because my answer to this entire vacuous debate is to “give a diverse group of people that you agree with the beliefs of the actual promotional and financial backing and then let them create something with their honest-to-god friendships.” Bearing witness to actual love and solidarity is what will change the hearts of young people, not endless McKinsey gargoyles with multi-million-dollar budgets for “data.” I should be clear that this isn’t to say every single podcast should be in the format I suggest, but that if you want whatever “The Joe Rogan Of The Left” is, the answer is “a podcast with a big audience where the people like the person speaking and as a result are compelled by their message.” It isn’t even about politics, it’s that when you cram a bunch of fucking money into something it tends to get big, and if that thing you create is a big boring piece of shit that’s clearly built to be — and even signposted in the news as built to be — manipulative, it is in and of itself sickening. I’m gonna continue clearing my throat: the trick here is not to lean right, nor has it ever been. Find a group of people who are compelling, diverse and genuinely enjoy being around each other and shove a whole bunch of advertising dollars into it and give it good production values to make it big, and then watch in awe as suddenly lots of people see it and your message spreads. Put a fucking trans person in there — give Western Kabuki real money, for example — and watch as people suddenly get used to seeing a trans person because you intentionally chose to do so, but didn’t make it weird or get upset when they don’t immediately vote your way. Because guess what — what people are hurting for right now is actual, real sincerity. Everybody feels like something is wrong. The products they use every day are increasingly-broken, pumped full of generative AI features that literally get in the way of what they’re trying to do, which already was made more difficult because companies like Meta and Google intentionally make their products harder to use as a means of making more money. And, let’s be clear, people are well aware of the billions in profits that these companies make at the customer’s expense. They feel talked down to, tricked, conned, abused and abandoned, both parties’ representatives operating in terms almost as selfish as the markets that they also profit from. They read articles that blandly report illegal or fantastical things as permissible and rational and think, for a second, “am I wrong? Is this really the case? This doesn’t feel the case?” while somebody tells them that despite the fact that they have less money and said money doesn’t go as far, they’re actually experiencing the highest standard of living in history. Ultimately, regular people are repeatedly made to feel like they don’t matter. Their products are overstuffed with confusing menus, random microtransactions, the websites they read full of advertisements disguised as stories and actual advertisements built to trick them, their social networks intentionally separating them from the things they want to see. And when you feel like you don’t matter, you look to other human beings, and other human beings are terrified of sincerity. They’re terrified of saying they’re scared, they’re angry, they’re sad, they’re lonely, they’re hurting, they’re constantly on a fucking tightrope, every day feels like something weird or bad is going to happen either on the news (which for no reason other than it helps rich people constantly tries to scare them that AI will take their jobs), and they just want someone to talk to, but everybody else is fucking unwilling to let their guard down after a decade-plus of media that valorized snark and sarcasm, because the lesson they learned about being emotionally honest was that it’s weird or they’re too much or it’s feminine for guys or it’s too feminine for women. Of course people feel like shit, so of course they’re going to turn to media that feels like real people made it, and they’ll turn to the media they’ll see the easiest, such as that given to them by the algorithm, or that which they are made to see by advertisement, or, of course, word of mouth. And if you’re sending someone to listen to something, and someone describes it in terms that sound like they’re hanging out with a friend, you’d probably give it a shot. Outside of podcasting, people’s options for mainstream (and an alarming amount of industry) news are somewhere between “I’m smarter than you,” “something happened!” “sneering contempt,” “a trip to the principal’s office,” or “here’s who you should be mad at,” which I realize also describes the majority of the New York Times opinion page. While “normies” of whatever political alignment might want exactly the slop they get on TV, that slop is only slop because the people behind it believe that regular people will only accept the exact median person’s version of the world, even if they can’t really articulate it beyond “whatever is the least-threatening opinion” (or the opposite in Fox News’ case). Really, I don’t have a panacea for what ails media, but what I do know is that in my own life I have found great joy in sincerity and love. In the last year I have made — and will continue to make, as it’s my honour to — tremendous effort to get to know the people closest to me, to be there for them if I can, to try and understand them better and to be my authentic and honest self around them, and accept and encourage them doing the same. Doing so has improved my life significantly, made me a better, more confident and more loving person, and I can only hope I provide the same level of love and acceptance to them as they do to me. Even writing that paragraph I felt the urge to pare it back, for fear that someone would accuse me of being insincere, for “speaking in therapy language,” for “trying to sound like a hero,” not that I am doing so, but because there are far more people concerned with moderating how emotional and sincere there are than those willing to stop actual societal harms. I think it’s partly because people see emotions as weakness. I don’t agree. I have never felt stronger and more emboldened than I have as I feel more love and solidarity with my friends, a group that I try to expand at any time I can. I am bolder, stronger (both physically and mentally), and far happier, as these friendships have given me the confidence to be who I am, and I offer the same aggressive advocacy to my friends in being who they are as they do to me. None of what I am saying is a one-size-fits-all solution. There is so much room for smaller, more niche projects, and I both encourage and delight in them. There is also so much more attention that can be given to these niche projects, and things are only “niche” until they are given the time in the light to become otherwise. There is also so much more that can be done within the mainstream power structures, if only there is the boldness to do so. Objective reporting is necessary — crucial, in fact! — to democracy, but said objectivity cannot come at the cost of context, and every time it does so, the reader is failed and the truth is suffocated. And I don’t believe objective reporting should be separated from actual commentary. In fact, if someone is a reporter on a particular beat, their opinion is likely significantly more-informed than that of someone “objective” and “outside of the coverage,” based on stuff like “domain expertise.” The true solution, perhaps, is more solidarity and more sincerity. It’s media outlets that back up their workers, with editorial missions that aggressively fight those who would con their readers or abuse their writers, focusing on the incentives and power of those they’re discussing rather than whether or not “the markets” agree with their sentiment. In any case, the last 15+ years of the media has led to a flattening of journalism, constantly swerving toward whatever the next big trend is — the pivot to video, contorting content to “go viral” on social media, SEO, or whatever big coverage area (AI, for example) everybody is chasing instead of focusing on making good shit people love. Years later, social networks have effectively given up on sending traffic to news, and now Google’s AI summaries are ripping away large chunks of the traffic of major media outlets that decided the smartest way to do their jobs was “make content for machines to promote,” never thinking for a second that those who owned the machines were never to be trusted. Worse still, outlets have drained the voices from their reporters, punishing them for having opinions, ripping out anything that might resemble a personality from their writing to meet some sort of vague “editorial voice” despite readers and viewers again and again showing that they want to read the news from a human being not an outlet. I maintain that things can change for the better, and it starts with a fundamental acceptance that those running the vast majority of media outlets aren’t doing so for their readers’ benefit. Once that happens, we can rebuild around distinct voices, meaningful coverage and a sense of sincerity that the mainstream media seems to consider the enemy. Subscribe today. It's free. Please.

Title: Is CoreWeave Stock Expensive After A Whopping 4x Rise?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/05/23: In this photo illustration, the CoreWeave (Core Weave) logo is seen displayed ... More on a smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) You’ve likely seen some extreme fluctuations in the stock markets recently. However, few have been as striking as CoreWeave’s (NASDAQ: CRWV) path since its IPO in late March. The cloud computing company’s stock has dramatically surged, soaring from $40 to $147 – a remarkable 3.6x return in just a few months. So what’s fueling this astronomical rise, and more importantly, is it sustainable? We’ll explore these questions. But, if you’re looking for potential profits with reduced volatility, the High Quality portfolio has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, yielding over 91% returns since its inception. Separately, check out – Will Adobe Stock See Higher Levels? CoreWeave is not your average cloud provider. While Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure provide a broad range of computing services, CoreWeave concentrates specifically on high-performance GPU-accelerated infrastructure tailored for AI and machine learning workloads. Consider them as the equipment rental service in a scenario where everyone suddenly requires advanced, specialized machinery without wanting to purchase it outright. Do they have clients? Microsoft, their largest customer, accounts for over 60% of their revenue. For organizations embarking on AI development, it makes complete sense to rent CoreWeave’s computing capabilities instead of committing tremendous capital expenditures for their own GPU farms or opting for a hybrid approach between purchasing and leasing. Why purchase when renting is an option, especially as technology evolves so quickly? However, it’s the numbers that make things intriguing—and somewhat concerning. CoreWeave operates 250,000 NVIDIA GPUs across 32 data centers. That sounds impressive until you find out that Microsoft allegedly owns 485,000 GPUs, and Meta is projected to have a staggering 1.3 million by year-end. CoreWeave is competing at high levels, but they’re still a relatively small player. The demand is so overwhelming that CoreWeave is aggressively expanding, resulting in significant debt levels. But here’s a crucial point: NVIDIA owns 7% of CoreWeave and maintains a solid partnership with them. The growth metrics are nearly unbelievable. CoreWeave’s revenue soared by 12,000% – increasing from just $16 million in 2022 to $1.9 billion in 2024. The forecasts are astounding: $5 billion anticipated in 2025, with $12 billion predicted for the following year. This kind of expansion accounts for why investors are ready to pay 25 times the trailing twelve-month revenue for the stock. Yet interestingly, the average analyst price target is about half of the current market price, indicating that even the experts believe things might be getting somewhat overheated. Having Microsoft constitute 60% of your revenue is both a boon and a prospective drawback. If Microsoft chose to decrease its dependence on CoreWeave tomorrow, it could pose a serious issue. However, here’s the critical question – in today’s AI-driven market, would CoreWeave genuinely struggle to attract other clients? The demand for AI infrastructure is skyrocketing across sectors. From startups crafting the next ChatGPT competitor to established enterprises incorporating AI into their operations, everyone requires computing power. The more significant question may be whether CoreWeave can scale quickly enough to satisfy demand, rather than if demand exists in the short term. Indeed, aggressive growth comes with sacrifices. CoreWeave is depleting cash with a net income margin of -39%. They’re prioritizing expansion over profits, wagering that gaining market share today will lead to profits tomorrow. It’s a high-stakes endeavor that demands solid determination and substantial financial resources. The elevated debt required for acquiring more GPUs adds another layer of complexity. Yet if the revenue forecasts are accurate, this debt should become more manageable over time. In summary, CoreWeave is an intriguing example of timing and specialization. They’ve positioned themselves impeccably for the AI surge, but they’re also wagering heavily that this boom will persist. The stock’s sharp ascent mirrors both the potential and the risks embedded in this strategy. For investors, the concern isn’t whether AI infrastructure is critical – it undoubtedly is. The concern is whether CoreWeave can preserve its growth trajectory while navigating its risks, especially regarding client concentration and debt levels. And perhaps most crucially, whether the current valuation provides any margin for the inevitable bumps along the road. One thing’s for certain: CoreWeave’s narrative is far from concluded, and it’s set to be an intriguing journey for anyone daring enough to strap in at the present lofty valuations. Now, taming valuation contextually is just one of the many methods we utilize while constructing the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a proven track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster experience, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Forbes Daily: No Israel And Iran Deal In Sight As Trump Calls For Peace

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. Social media has surged into the mainstream—and its most-successful creators aren’t just there for the likes. They’re entrepreneurs. The 50 richest on Forbes’ 2025 Top Creators list earned an estimated $853 million, an 18% increase from 2024’s record year. And that doesn’t include the millions they’re hauling in from brand partnerships. “Next year, it’s expected that influencer marketing will expand to $50 billion,” says Ryan Detert, founder and CEO of creator marketing firm Influential, who partnered with Forbes on our list. And with the rise of AI, content creation is set to accelerate, as advanced editing and targeting software allow influencers to produce videos cheaper, faster and better. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump watch fireworks following a parade to honor the Army's 250th anniversary, coinciding with Trump's 79th birthday, Saturday, June 14, 2025, in Washington. Missile strikes between Israel and Iran entered their fourth day Monday, and President Donald Trump is pushing for peace, having recently vetoed an Israeli plan to kill Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Trump did not offer specifics about the peace negotiations, later telling ABC News he was “open” to Russian President Vladimir Putin serving as a mediator and they had “a long talk about it.” Demonstrators crowded streets, parks and plazas for “No Kings” protests across the U.S. Saturday, and organizers say millions of people gathered to oppose the president’s agenda. In Washington, D.C. Saturday, rain muted the fanfare for the Army’s 250th anniversary and military parade, while TikTokers who’d reserved tickets with no intention of attending took credit for the parade’s “modest” attendance. Authorities arrested a 57-year-old suspected of killing Minnesota State Rep. Melissa Hortman and shooting State Senator John Hoffman in separate attacks early Saturday morning, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz announced late on Sunday. Walz called it a “politically motivated assassination,” and the suspected shooter had a list of up to 70 names, including abortion providers and advocates. Friday was the worst day in weeks for all three major stock indexes, as investors weighed geopolitical concerns in the aftermath of Israel’s strike on Iran, which subsequently launched counterstrikes. It was also the single-largest one-day boost in oil prices in more than three years, and the price of the traditional safe haven gold also shot up. “If Iranian oil production is significantly disrupted, oil has the potential to go much higher,” warned LPL Financial’s chief equity strategist Jeff Buchbinder. Brazil-based JBS, the world’s largest meatpacker, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, where its stock price increased nearly 5% by the end of the day despite a history of corruption by its billionaire board directors Joesley and Wesley Batista. The brothers, who are the top shareholders in the company and serve as board directors, saw their net worths rise with the IPO, and are now worth $4.8 billion each. Billionaires have the ability to indulge in almost anything, but a new Forbes survey asking the world’s richest about the luxury they can’t live without found that the most common answer was a private jet. The reason is primarily convenience: While flying commercial typically takes several hours, with all the security, boarding and taxiing, a private jet can be ready in minutes. Meta plans to acquire a 49% stake in Scale AI for $14.3 billion, supporting its sprawling AI ambitions. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg: Forbes has learned that Meta intends to pay Scale at least $450 million a year for five years for its AI products, or more than half of its annual AI spend, whichever is less. President Donald Trump acknowledged last week that his aggressive immigration crackdown is driving away long-time workers from the agricultural and hospitality industries, jobs such businesses are struggling to fill. Meanwhile, the Trump Organization has consistently utilized temporary visa programs to hire foreign workers for Mar-a-Lago, four golf clubs and his Virginia winery—even increasing its use of these visa programs in recent years. As the Trump Administration has targeted USAID for cuts, it is aiming to defund the agency’s inspector general’s office, which is tasked with rooting out fraud in foreign aid—and it saves taxpayers billions. The cuts have raised concerns among members of the Senate’s Committee on Foreign Relations and the Appropriations Committee, which oversees the agency. President Donald Trump’s pause on new appointments for J-1 visas had already thrown a wrench in medical residencies for foreign-born doctors, now a travel ban on individuals from 19 countries is complicating it further. Foreign-born international medical school graduates are a crucial part of solving the doctor shortage, but they must complete a U.S. residency before practicing medicine here. The Senate confirmed former Rep. Billy Long of Missouri as the next IRS commissioner in a vote along party lines, ending a contentious period at the agency. Long was confirmed despite the fact that he has no college degree or formal training in tax, law or accounting—and amid concerns about his ties to companies that promoted controversial tax credits. ILLUSTRATION BY SAMANTHA LEE FOR FORBES; IMAGES BY SIRJ_PO/GETTY IMAGES; BUBAONE/GETTY IMAGES; OXANA PLOTNIKOVA/GETTY IMAGES; VISHAL GHORI/GETTY IMAGES; BORTONIA/GETTY IMAGES Real estate entrepreneur Alexandre Rizk opened Las Vegas’ first cannabis-friendly hotel two years ago, believing he had a “genius, million-dollar idea.” It turned out to be a flop. Within five months of launching The Lexi on West Sahara Avenue, Rizk knew he had made a mistake as occupancy topped out at 30% and he started losing bids to host weddings and other group events to competitors who don’t cater to cannabis consumers. Rizk sold his first cannabis-friendly hotel in Phoenix and is in the process of rebranding The Lexi. After he stopped advertising the property as cannabis-friendly, occupancy jumped 15%. “Unfortunately, this venture could cost me my entire career,” says Rizk, who personally invested $5 million into the 64-room, adults-only hotel, which he bought with other investors for $12 million in 2022. Despite Rizk’s cautionary tale, Las Vegas is perpetually wrestling with how to integrate cannabis and casinos, particularly now that gaming revenue has declined this year. Nevada legalized medical marijuana in 2001 and recreational marijuana in 2020, but thanks to federal law and Nevada gaming rules, casinos cannot invest in or be a part of the state-regulated marijuana trade without risking losing their gaming license. Nevada’s legislators have gone further and instituted rules that ban dispensaries within 1,500 feet from a licensed casino and forbids them from delivering legal orders on The Strip. In other words, doing business with the cannabis industry would be a death sentence for casino operators. WHY IT MATTERS Brendan Bussmann, the managing partner of B Global, a consulting firm focused on gaming and hospitality, says Las Vegas’ greatest skill is its ability to offer entertainment to the masses, but that the anything-goes debauchery Sin City is famous for is like a David Copperfield show—largely an illusion. “Yes, you can have gaming here, and yes, you can have fun in a host of different ways,” says Bussmann, “but we’re not here to say there are no rules.” MORE The Inside Story Of Las Vegas’ First Cannabis-Friendly Hotel Coco Gauff is one of the world’s highest-paid tennis players, but the more than $2.9 million she earned from winning the French Open will be slashed nearly in half after paying required taxes. The American tennis player beat Aryna Sabalenka to win the tournament: 45%: The tax bracket she will be subject to in France, which would reduce her winnings to just over $1.6 million, and she could be required to pay additional taxes $65.2 million: The combined prize-money pool for the French Open, 6.3% higher than the previous year, according to the ATP Tour Third: Gauff’s ranking on Forbes’ 2024 list of the World’s Highest-Paid Tennis Players If you’re anxious about running out of money in retirement, try the “Fill the Gap” approach. Determine your monthly guaranteed income and expenses, and calculate the gap between the two. To figure out how much you should have in liquid investments to cover it, take the yearly shortfall and multiply it by 25. That can become the target for an investment portfolio that balances income and growth.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 06/16 update below. This post was originally published on June 15 Bitcoin and crypto have surged this year as traders bet U.S. president Donald Trump’s administration will further boost the bitcoin price (helped by Treasury secretary Scott Bessent issuing a surprise crypto market prediction). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has traded above $100,000 per bitcoin since early May after rebounding from Trump’s tariff-induced slump as rumors swirl of a looming, “extraordinary” White House update. Now, as traders await an imminent Federal Reserve bombshell, the U.S. Senate is poised to vote on the Trump administration’s landmark stablecoin bill, with Trump promising it will lead to the U.S. “dominating” bitcoin and crypto and expected to open up the crypto market to “trillions of tokenized dollars." Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump has made it a priority of his administration to get stablecoin ... More legislation passed, something that's helped support the bitcoin price and crypto market in recent months. This week, the U.S. Senate voted 68 to 30 to move forward the so-called Genius Act that would regulate stablecoins, setting the bipartisan bill up for a final vote that’s scheduled for Tuesday, June 17. 06/16 update: Amazon and Walmart are among some of the biggest companies weighing whether to launch their own stablecoins or forge partnership with stablecoin companies, according to a Wall Street Journal report citing anonymous sources. Travel company Expedia and unnamed airlines were also said to be considering creating their own stablecoins to ease the cost and speed of transactions as a result of stablecoin legislation that’s expected to be passed by U.S. lawmakers. If individual companies decide they'd prefer to launch their own stablecoins rather than use those issued by the likes of Tether and Circle or use those in development by Wall Street banks, it could disrupt the entire financial system, starting with the companies who make the most from processing fees: Visa and Mastercard. In May, a report revealed Mark Zuckerberg is planning to add crypto support for Meta’s 3 billion global users. Meta is "in discussions with crypto firms to introduce stablecoins as a means to manage payouts," Fortune reported, citing anonymous sources. Meta, which runs the Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp platforms and is developing a shared virtual reality it calls the metaverse, is still licking its wounds from its failed attempt to upend the global financial system with its libra-diem crypto-inspired currency that was torpedoed by regulators in 2019. “The version of the Genius Act that we will invoke cloture on today reflects months of hard work and negotiations from members on both sides of the aisle,” Republican majority leader John Thune said in comments reported by Politico, adding, "it’s time to move forward and pass this legislation." If sent onto Trump’s desk for his signature, the Genius Act would provide a legal and regulatory framework for stablecoins—a form of bitcoin-inspired cryptocurrency that’s usually pegged to the U.S. dollar and used to move money around the world more quickly and cheaply than traditional payment rails. "This clarity could unlock trillions in financial and payment rails innovation," Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Hashdex Asset Management, said in emailed comments, and pointing to stablecoin transaction volume that has recently surpassed Visa and Mastercard. “A finalized framework [for stablecoin legislation] in the U.S. could unleash a new wave of institutional adoption and product innovation, possibly bringing trillions of tokenized dollars to the market in the years to come.” The stablecoin market—dominated by Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC—has rocketed from almost zero 10 years ago to $250 billion today, with Wall Street, the world’s biggest retailers and Silicon Valley technology giants this year scrambling to grab a slice of the red-hot market. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent echoed a report from analysts with Standard Chartered Bank this week when he predicted U.S. stablecoin legislation would boost the market 10-fold to around $2 trillion. Meanwhile, U.S. president Donald Trump said he’s proud to be considered the first “crypto president” during a pre-recorded address to Coinbase’s State of Crypto Summit, telling attendees that after passing the Genius Act stablecoin legislation he wants to create a “clear and simple market frameworks that will allow America to dominate the future of crypto and bitcoin.” Trump has fully embraced bitcoin and crypto over the last year, following through on his campaign promise to create a U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve via an executive order in March and also launching his own memecoin and U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin via his family’s World Liberty Financial project. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged over the last year, topping $100,000 as U.S. president Donald Trump ... More embraces crypto and sparking a flurry of bullish bitcoin price predictions. Trump’s growing ties to crypto, which Forbes found has added around $1 billion to his personal wealth, has been used by Democratic Party lawmakers to campaign against the Genius Act, with Democratic representative Jamie Raskin from Maryland warning last month that Trump’s crypto ventures offered the “perfect opportunity for foreign government, corporate and individual funds to be funneled into Donald Trump’s bank account and his family’s finances.” Bitcoin and crypto traders expecting clarity on stablecoin regulation has helped support the bitcoin price in recent months that’s been rocked along with stock markets by trade tensions. “Bitcoin appears to be consolidating above $100,000,” David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said in emailed comments, pointing to the settling market turmoil caused by Trump’s global trade war. “Recent moves to strengthen regulation across stablecoins have also helped.”

Title: Single-Stock ETF Market Swells With Firehose of New Products
URL: https://www.thedailyupside.com/etf/thematics-sectors/single-stock-etf-market-swells-with-firehose-of-new-products/
Time Published: 2025-06-16T10:05:00Z

Dozens of single-stock ETFs using leverage have recently been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com 2025 is shaping up to be the year of the single-stock ETF. While the number of leveraged single-stock ETFs in the US more than doubled in the first four months of the year, things may just be getting started. In the past few weeks alone, dozens of such products have been filed for registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Those include 10 ETFs from Themes, 14 from Defiance, and 12 from LevMax. To put those numbers in perspective, there were a total of 42 leveraged single-stock ETFs on the market at the beginning of the year, according to Morningstar Direct data. The first such products appeared after the SEC approved the concept in 2022. “Retail investors have long desired to have institutional trading options for a long period of time, but they’ve been hamstrung, because options can be difficult, shorting can be difficult, and there are all sorts of risks that can be associated with those things,” said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer of Themes ETFs. The most aggressive of the proposed products are the triple-leveraged LevMax ETFs. Those funds have “a predetermined upside return cap” but also seek to limit downside by “matching any negative performance of the underlying security on a one-to-one basis,” the prospectuses state. Themes, whose US ETF assets just surpassed $100 million, would seek “accelerated returns” with caps on the potential upside on five ETFs using at-the-money calls with a one-month expiration. The upside cap would come from selling two call options. “This is just an innovative way to use period-certain leveraged exposure to some of the most popular names,” Marino said. “It’s a way to offer accelerated returns without taking accelerated risk.” Other ETFs in the works take different approaches: Rolling the Dice: The rise in leveraged ETFs “is super-connected with this surge in sports betting we’ve seen,” said Victor Haghani, founder of Elm Wealth. While there is a potential use case for young investors with low financial capital having some leverage via an S&P 500 ETF, even that instance would be difficult to justify, he said. With $100 invested in a 2X ETF, for example, “the cost of leverage is always going to be much higher than Treasury bills,” he said. “That second $100 (of exposure via leverage) isn’t really giving you anything.” There is no case for leveraged single-stock ETFs, he said. Even if a stock were to maintain its price over time, any volatility would lead to leveraged ETFs rebalancing often and creating a drag on net returns, not to mention fees, he said. “What you get is not what most people think they’re going to get.” The asset manager disclosed that it will close and liquidate the mutual funds and ETFs, including the BlackRock Impact Mortgage Fund. ETFs with exposure to shipping and defense have largely held strong despite a series of Israeli missile strikes against Iran. The SEC has warmed up to crypto ETFs and staking, but whether it will approve both in the same package is a question. Mutual fund shareholders and retirement savers stand to benefit more than others from dual share class approval. The firm, which offers six digital assets ETFs, announced a new global product leadership team earlier this year. The company on Wednesday joined the ranks of fund managers that have filed for exemptive relief to offer ETF share classes of mutual funds. Vanguard reduced fees on 87 funds earlier this year, and Schwab just lowered costs on ETFs with $66 billion in total assets. ETFs tracking the performance of weight-loss drugs have largely underperformed since launching in late 2023. The company is prepping a private credit mutual fund that adds a unique flavor — tokenization. One firm is converting a $12 billion mutual fund to an ETF, and it isn’t alone in doing so before the SEC approves dual share classes. The ETF, named after Truth Social, will be managed by Trump’s new fintech, Truth.fi. Proxy advisors are accused of being cartels, but shareholder advocates say they side with corporations in nearly all voting recommendations. © 2025 The Daily Upside

US-based big tech multinational firm Oracle's Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Larry Ellison's net worth, witnessed a massive multi-billion-dollar surge last week as the 80-year-old's value hit $258.8 billion in June 2025. Data collected from the Forbes Billionaire List showed Ellison replaced Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to become the second-richest billionaire in the world. Larry Ellison's net worth rose by $66.8 billion to hit its level of $258.8 billion last week, compared to its $192 billion levels mentioned in the World's Billionaires List for 2025. According to Bloomberg data, Larry Ellison holds more than 40 per cent of the tech company along with a stake in Elon Musk's Tesla, a sailing team, a tennis event, and real estate, including the Lanai island in Hawaii. However, according to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index, Ellison is the third richest billionaire, with the last change marking a $13.9 billion increase. The data showed that Larry Ellison's net worth was $234 billion, trailing behind Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. The billionaire CTO's net worth jumped after the company published an earnings report that beat Wall Street analysts' expectations. According to the official fourth quarter 2024-25 fiscal year results, the big tech firm's total quarterly revenues witnessed an 11 per cent year-on-year (YoY) jump to $15.9 billion, with major support from its cloud services and license support revenues, which recorded a 14 per cent jump in constant currency at $11.7 billion. The company's net income (GAAP) was $3.4 billion while the earnings per share were at $1.19. “FY25 was a very good year — but we believe FY26 will be even better as our revenue growth rates will be dramatically higher,” said Oracle CEO, Safra Catz, in the filing. “MultiCloud database revenue from Amazon, Google and Azure grew 115% from Q3 to Q4,” said Oracle Chairman and CTO, Larry Ellison, according to the official release. Oracle shares closed nearly 7.6 per cent higher at $215.22 after Friday's US stock market session, compared to $199.86 at the previous market close. The stock earlier jumped nearly 14 per cent on Thursday's market open after the company announced better-than-expected results for its fourth quarter on 11 June 2025. Oracle Corp. shares have given stock market investors more than 295 per cent returns on their investment in the last five years and over 52 per cent in the last one-year period. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, the shares have gained 29.63 per cent in 2025 and are trading 23.26 per cent higher in the last five stock market sessions. The shares hit their 52-week high levels at $216.60, while the 52-week low level was at ₹118.86, according to the data collected from Marketwatch.

Title: What’s new in the wearable world of smart glasses, and extended and augmented reality

Are you ready for AR? Meta, Google, Snap and more are gearing up to compete with Apple and deliver frames-based communications devices – complete with AI integration When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. What’s next in the world of intelligent wearables? A few years ago, smart glasses were still a punchline to a joke about tech overreach, with much-vaunted concepts like Google Glass confined to developers and ambitious enterprise clients. What do smart glasses offer to the rest of us, apart from one more reason to be suspicious of those wearing sunglasses indoors or when it's overcast? Spectacles AR glasses from Snap This summer’s announcement of Android XR as a new force in wearable operating systems won’t come to consumers until early next year. XR is designed to work via audio or with internal lens displays, and it’s the latter that’ll generate the most buzz when the first devices arrive in 2026. Viture Pro XR Glasses It’s not to be confused with conventional XR glasses, as above, which achieve extended reality by projecting a tiny display onto the back of frames that create what are effectively giant wearable screens. The proximity to the eye creates a vast digital canvas that feels a few feet away. Whilst these are good for air travel, for example, allowing you to watch movies and even work, these kinds of XR glasses aren’t designed to use whilst wandering around. To handle the processing, most smart glasses have a separate pack to handle graphics, seen here with the RayNeo Air 3S Some commentators have speculated that the transparency and layering elements of Apple’s new Liquid Glass design approach – itself derived from the boundary-less interface of the Apple Vision Pro – is opening up their OS to the potential of a glasses-powered interface. Given that Google is busy developing its Vision OS-style platform, it seems more than likely that the search giant will also have its own hardware to accompany it, as well as licensing the tech to others – it recently announcing a tie-in with American eyewear brand Warby Parker. Smart glasses from Even Realities Glasses come in many formats, some of which follow the Google extended and augmented reality approach, while others just serve as a portal for interaction with a smart agent. Others promise to enhance hearing and fitness tracking or simply provide a way to make calls and listen to music. We’ve taken stock of what’s new and next in the world of smart glasses. Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses Right now, Ray-Ban’s Meta glasses are dipping in price as the companies gear up to launch a new iteration. Currently on their second generation and sold via high profile ads featuring Chrises Pratt and Hemsworth, Ray-Ban originally teamed up with Meta AI to embed the tech giant’s chatbot into the frames back in 2023. Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses Today you can choose between Wayfarer and Skyler frames, along with a variety of tints and finishes (including prescription lenses). Audio is conducted via open air speakers built into the arms, and the 12MP camera can be used alongside the Meta AI app in your smartphone. The AI responds to spoken queries and identifies songs, as well as record video and messages and other potentially socially divisive activities. Receive our daily digest of inspiration, escapism and design stories from around the world direct to your inbox. Ray-Ban.com Spectacles AR glasses from Snap Snap Inc, the makers of Snapchat, are currently trialling their fifth generation Spectacles, augmented reality glasses that overlay a graphical image over the real world whilst still (just about) providing a regular sunglasses-like appearance that doesn’t conceal your eyes. Next up are ‘Specs’, the sixth-generation iteration of the tech, due in 2026. This time the frames will smaller and slimmer, with deeper AI-integration (using both OpenAI and Google Gemini) to allow for realtime queries about your surroundings. Spectacles.com RayNeo Air 3S Think of RayNeo’s Air 3s XR Glasses are personal screens - effectively a projector you wear on your eyes. They come complete with inbuilt Google TV, immersive sound and connectivity for everything from your mobile and PC to the Nintendo Switch. RayNeo.com Viture Pro XR Glasses Viture’s Pro XR Glasses come with Harman audio, jet black lenses that let no light escape from the internal microLED screens and promised single cable connection to anything. Details of Viture's Pro XR Glasses Users can expect a display that equates to a 135” TV at a distance of 3m, with fast refresh rates for smooth motion in games and inbuilt lens correction to help the shortsighted. Aimed primarily at gaming and media consumption, the company’s newest glasses weigh in at 78g, although they’re still pretty chunky. Pro.Viture.com Project Aura One Pro by Xreal (left), alongside the Air 2 Ultra (right) With the first product due next year, Project Aura is being touted as the first glasses-style application of Android XR. Xreal will be selling several Project Aura models, including the high-end One Pro models that combine elements like prescription lenses and Bose sound with the ins and outs of the XR OS. These will supplement existing wearable display models like Xreal's Air 2 Ultra. Xreal's Beam Pro is a spatial computing AR companion device designed to enhance Google apps The Aura glasses get UI elements that pop up persistently within your physical space, similar in concept to the Vision Pro, only without the all-encompassing design of Apple’s product. Project Aura will also require a separate box to handle the processing power. Xreal.com Samsung's Project Moohan Android XR headset Before Xreal, Samsung hopes to get its Project Moohan headset to market. Clearly very derivative of the Vision Pro, this device was first shown at MWC 2025 and will no doubt lose the codename when it finally arrives. Unlike the Apple device, Samsung has opted not to integrate a screen to show the user’s eyes, so wearers will be completely incognito. Samsung.com Smart glasses by Even Realities A new brand from China, Even Realties is branching out with its own dedicated OS and projector system, throwing up info like translation and navigation details onto the lens. Notes and AI-driven suggestions can also be projected onto the lens, appearing as if the text was around two metres from your eyeball. A mock-up of the projector system developed by Even Realities Available in two models, the G1A and G1B, the glasses can be specified with prescription lenses and have a far slimmer profile than other approaches. The proprietary software works in part with a tilt of the head and can even be used as a discrete teleprompter device. EvenRealities.com OCOSense by Emteq Labs Still in early development, UK-based start-up Emteq Labs is developing the OCOSense platform, a sensor-driven, frames-mounted set-up that uses a pair of smart glasses to track, amongst other things, facial expressions and emotional responses using Optomyography, a high-volume sensor system that measures muscular response across the face. The first version of the OCOSense glasses Capable of making 6,000 readings a second, this data is spliced with ChatGPT-interpreted inputs on things like environment and even food. A suggested application is monitoring physical and mental fitness as well as diet. EmteqLabs.com Nuance Audio Glasses The smart thing about the new Nuance Audio Glasses, recently launched in the US by EssilorLuxottica (and also available in select outlets in the UK), is that they have an integrated hearing solution. Eschewing all the AI assistance and other OS complexities, Nuance focuses on a single, solvable issue – how to improve your hearing in noisy and crowded environments. Paired with a dedicated app that allows you to fine tune the onboard mics and noise cancelling, the glasses are a subtle way to counter the 50% of people who have some form of hearing loss over the age of 55.

Title: Rajrishi Singhal: What markets demand needn’t be what society wants

Apple’s highly anticipated developer conference this year has not only disappointed reviewers and equity markets, but also raised many disturbing questions. One, it has raised anxieties over the future viability of the iPhone manufacturer. More importantly, it highlights the divergence between what is good for society versus what is good for the stock market, belying the benign and popular perception of the role that equity markets play in society. Apple’s developer conferences, called WWDC25 this year, are usually a marquee event in the tech world, providing independent developers and tech analysts an inkling of the company’s progress with hardware and software. At WWDC25 on 9 June, Apple executives were able to share only a limited future path for the company, especially on its progress with artificial intelligence (AI). Apple’s senior executives told the gathering that the promise made last year about upgrading Apple Intelligence, with voice assistant Siri as its centrepiece, would take some more time to accomplish. Also Read: China plus one: Apple and India might need to woo not just Trump but Xi too This left many analysts and developers cold. Even the stock market expressed its displeasure: Apple’s common stock has tanked almost 25% from its 52-week high. The market’s disapproval, interestingly, is not limited to Apple’s slow progress in integrating AI, but also centres around the company’s data privacy policies. The market’s unhappiness seems to stem from the company’s reluctance to use a customer’s individual usage data or information as an input for training personalized AI models. Apple instead prefers to use insights based on aggregate consumer preferences, unlike competitors like Microsoft and Google. It would then appear that the market is rewarding companies that will profit from scraping individual data, rather than businesses which have red lines on using personal data. Also Read: Apple’s Hotel California trap: It can check out but not leave China The market’s simple logic is that companies using personal data for their AI engines can unlock new revenue sources by offering consumers hyper-personalized offerings. Plus, there is the subscription angle. For example, individual subscription rates for Microsoft’s Copilot Pro are expected to be around $20 every month, its key selling point being its ability to unlock AI features in all Microsoft 365 products, such as Word or PowerPoint, allowing customers to generate drafts, summarize content or analyse data at a faster rate. Google AI Pro will also be available to customers at the same rate, but a turbo-charged version called Google AI Ultra will be available for $250 per month. When this columnist asked Google’s Gemini how Apple’s future AI plans can make money for the company, one part of the AI engine’s reply stood out: “Apple’s strong stance on privacy (‘intelligence without surveillance’) is a powerful differentiator in an era of increasing data concerns. This can foster greater trust and loyalty among its user base, leading to continued purchases of Apple products and services over competitors. While not a direct revenue stream, it’s a critical factor in sustaining its high-margin business model." Also Read: Dave Lee: Apple must make peace with developers for AI success Yet, the stock market did not seem impressed. Clearly, for market operators, short-term corporate profits have greater primacy over privacy concerns. Even if we were to disregard the normative issues of morality or ethics for a moment, the stock market’s responses are visibly out of sync with society’s needs or concerns. There is a reason for this: the stock market is focused on the limited constituency it serves. Its behaviour aligns almost perfectly with the objectives set out by institutional investors or companies looking to raise money. In the not-too-distant past, the market was bestowing the Apple stock with a premium too because the company had plugs and ports that differed from other manufacturers, guaranteeing the company exclusive, high-margin revenues, even if that meant consumer discomfort or the exercise of near-monopolistic power. Also Read: Big Tech in the dock: The EU could force Meta and Apple to change their coercive ways The statement that the market’s singular focus on corporate bottom-lines and their impact on share prices does not necessarily align with what could be good for broader society might seem like belabouring a truism; but the need to reiterate this has arisen in the face of a growing tendency to conflate a stock market’s signals with the desires or ambitions of society on the whole. One good example of the market-versus-society divergence is the premium that US equity markets placed on companies setting up manufacturing bases in China. This was happening at a time when the US political class and civil society were bemoaning the absence of democracy and human rights in the North Asian country, even while hoping that closer integration with the global economy would discipline its regime. Reality has turned out otherwise, but stock markets continued to glorify companies that moved production to China.

On 9 June, at Apple Inc.’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), chief executive Tim Cook and his top brass unveiled a slew of updates, including a new ‘liquid glass’ design and enhancements to Apple Intelligence. But analysts, developers and investors were left underwhelmed. The announcements felt incremental, many of the features already exist in rival products. Some had hoped Apple would use the event to mount a dramatic AI comeback. That didn’t happen. Its shares slipped about 1.5% on the Nasdaq post-keynote. Apple’s troubles didn’t begin with WWDC. The event merely spotlighted its deeper struggle to keep pace with competitors. Its share price has dropped nearly 20% so far this year, the steepest decline among the five big tech firms, including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google. Read this | Apple opens its trillion-dollar app empire to AI devs at WWDC 2025—India stands to gain big That drop reflects a mix of investor concerns: sluggish iPhone sales; declining market share in China, one of its biggest markets; rising regulatory scrutiny of its high-margin services business; its faltering AI ambitions; and renewed criticism from US president Donald Trump over its global outsourcing amid tariff threats. In the past six years, about 52% of Apple’s revenue has come from the iPhone. But the device is in a rut. Growth has been flat for two years, dragging down overall revenue. In the December 2024 quarter, iPhone sales slipped 0.8% year-on-year. In the March quarter, they rose just 1.9%. Earlier growth in iPhones was driven by customers upgrading their phones. They are less willing to do that now. The China challengeChina has long been crucial to Apple—as a major consumer market and a manufacturing base. Today, it poses a twin threat. Apple’s deep integration with Chinese supply chains makes it hard to relocate production without disruption. This makes it vulnerable to tariff threats from the Trump administration. It is moving some production to India, but tariff-related risks remain. Read this | No change to Apple's India iPhone plan for now amid Trump's strictures Apple is also facing weakening demand in China. The iPhone's share in the Chinese smartphone market fell to 15% in Q1 of 2025, against 21% in Q4 of 2023. Chinese brands such as Huawei and Xiaomi have gained share, a trend expected to continue. Only 21% of Chinese consumers would choose an iPhone for their next purchase, down from 29% a year ago, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence survey. Apple's position in the country is also complicated by the Chinese government's ban on foreign technology in some workplaces and broader geopolitical tensions. Services face headwindsApple's sluggish iPhone sales have recently been offset by its services business. The division’s revenues jumped from $46 billion in 2019 to $96 billion in 2024, with its revenue share increasing from 17% to 24%. Profit margins of its services division are double those of its hardware business. However, the practices that drive its services business are under regulatory pressure globally. The fees Apple collects from app developers, and the payments it gets from Google to be the default search engine on its devices (estimated at $20 billion a year), are facing legal challenges.

Title: 6 Great Vanguard Index Funds For A Buy-And-Hold Portfolio
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/6-best-vanguard-index-funds-for-buy-hold-portfolio/
Time Published: 2025-06-14T15:00:00Z

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. A buy-and-hold portfolio built with Vanguard funds can be cost-efficient, diversified and ... More profitable. Trying to predict where the market’s headed amid geopolitical unrest and ever-changing tariff policies can be exhausting. Fortunately, you don't have to predict the future to make money investing. A diversified buy-and-hold portfolio plus a good dose of patience can help you reach your wealth goals without timing the market. Vanguard funds are good candidates for buy-and-hold portfolios because they cover popular market segments, and many have low expense ratios. Whether you want a simple two-fund portfolio or something more complex, one or more of the six funds on this list can provide the diversified exposure you need. The table below introduces six Vanguard funds for the buy-and-hold investor. The first two funds, VTI and VOO, provide overlapping exposure to domestic stocks. Most investors will choose one of them as a core, anchor position. The other four funds provide complementary exposure for a well-diversified portfolio. Some of these funds are also available as Vanguard mutual funds, which you may have access to in your 401(k). The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF represents the entire U.S. stock market, from small to large companies. The fund uses a sampling approach to replicate market returns. This helps keep costs lower versus owning every stock available. Even so, VTI holds more than 3,500 stocks and provides exposure to all economic sectors. VTI is an efficient pick for whole market exposure with its low expense ratio and low tracking error. Tracking error is the performance difference between the fund and its underlying index. VTI’s tracking error on a NAV basis has historically been one or two basis points. As a core stock holding, you could weight VTI as high as 90%—assuming you can handle risk and you’re not investing in other stock funds. More conservative investors would allocate 40% to 80% to VTI, depending on what else is in the portfolio. VTI's average annual return over the past 10 years is 12.14%. The fund does pay quarterly dividends with a 30-day SEC yield of 1.24%. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF invests in the S&P 500, which includes the largest and most successful U.S. public companies. This fund is a popular choice for novice and experienced investors. According to ETF Database, VOO is the largest U.S. ETF as measured by assets under management. Compared to VTI, VOO is more heavily concentrated on big tech stocks. You’d choose VOO as your core holding if you believe those mega-cap companies will continue their historic growth trajectories. In June 2024, a Morgan Stanley report noted that the Magnificent Seven stocks drove more than half of the S&P 500's 26.3% gain in 2023. Those stocks—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla—have been less dominant in 2025, but it's hard to count them out. VOO allocation guidelines are the same as VTI’s. Your exposure can range from 40% to 90%, depending on the rest of your portfolio and your risk tolerance. VOO has returned 12.81% annually on average over the past decade. The fund pays quarterly dividends, with a 30-day SEC yield of 1.24%. Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF invests in more than 800 domestic small-cap companies. Industrials and financials are the top sectors in the portfolio, followed by consumer discretionary and real estate. Small caps suit a buy-and-hold portfolio because they have good growth potential and some volatility. Longer holding periods smooth out the rough edges and average to positive returns. Small-cap returns have outperformed large caps in multi-year cycles, but not since 2011. Analysts from investment firm Wellington Management and Chartered Financial Analyst Daniel Fang believe small caps will take the lead again soon. An 8% to 10% small-cap allocation is an appropriate starting point for buy-and-hold investors. Remember to consider the small-cap exposure you already have in a total market fund like VTI. VBR has delivered an average annual return of 7.84% since May 2015. The fund pays quarterly dividends with a 30-day SEC yield of 2.1%. The Vanguard Total International Stock ETF invests in more than 8,000 foreign large-cap companies. The fund tracks the FTSE Global Call Cap ex US Index, which includes stocks from emerging and developed markets. Investing outside the U.S. can provide access to lower valuations and potentially higher growth potential. There can be more volatility, too, which underscores the importance of diversification and long holding periods. Buying and holding a broad international fund like VXUS checks both boxes. Charles Schwab recommends an international stock allocation of 5% to 40%, but many investors will opt for 10% to 20%. The David Swensen Portfolio uses a 15% allocation. Swensen formerly managed Yale University’s endowment fund, famously growing it from $1 billion to $31 billion. VXUS has produced an average annual return of 5.6% since May of 2015. The Vanguard Real Estate Fund offers growth and income potential through its real estate investment trusts (REIT) holdings. The fund tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 index. The index includes about 150 small, mid and large-cap REITs, and the top holding comprises less than 7% of the portfolio. REITs often pay high dividend yields because they distribute 90% of their income to shareholders. A related perk is that REITs do not pay corporate taxes on the distributed income. So REIT investors sidestep the double taxation that occurs with non-REIT companies—when profits are taxed at the corporate level and again with shareholder dividends. A REIT fund also provides access to the real estate market, which typically doesn’t move in lockstep with stocks. This provides a nice diversification benefit, alongside good returns. The FTSE Nareit All REIT index produced a pretax average annual return of 11.1% between 1972 and 2024, according to data provided by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (Nareit). A Morningstar analysis concludes that a portfolio with 51% stocks, 34% bonds and 15% REITs outperformed a 60-40 split between stocks and bonds more than half the time between 1976 and 2022. A typical REIT allocation would be 5% to 15%. VNQ pays quarterly distributions. The total distributions over the past 12 months were $3.63, which equates to a yield of about 4%. The Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF invests in investment-grade, intermediate-term U.S. bonds. Tax-exempt bonds and TIPS are excluded. Treasury bonds comprise nearly half of the portfolio, with government mortgage-backed securities and corporate bonds making up another 44%. Bonds provide income and relative price stability, two traits that complement stocks. Your allocation to this fund should depend on your risk tolerance. If you don’t like risk, opt for higher bond exposure—say, 50% of your portfolio. If you are comfortable with the volatile nature of stocks, your bond exposure could be as low as 10%. BND pays monthly distributions with a 30-day SEC yield of 4.47%. Bottom Line A buy-and-hold portfolio built with Vanguard funds can be cost-efficient, diversified and profitable. Start by setting target allocations for different asset types—from large caps to REITs and bonds—based on your risk tolerance. Then plug matching funds into your allocation formula and wait for your returns to build over time.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / JUNE 14 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture.

Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce.

Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas.

Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems.

Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell.

At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations.

It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis.

Title: The Tech Job Meltdown

Full Content:
He wrote me a prescription; he said “You are depressedI'm glad you came to see me to get this off your chestCome back and see me later, next patient pleaseSend in another victim of industrial disease”Industrial Disease, Dire Straits Since the start of 2023, more than half-a-million tech workers have been laid off. This isn’t the impact of COVID, this isn’t a sudden realization that tech workers are under-performing, this isn’t (much) a wave of AI making tech workers more efficient, and the other usual shibboleths like “it was overhiring during the pandemic” or “it’s a wave of H1B workers” or “all knowledge worker jobs are being replaced by LLMs” are only vaguely correct. You could make a pretty reasonable case that it was the end of Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP) and the corresponding impact of cost of capital - that the cost of borrowing went up, thus venture capital became a less attractive investment class than other areas, so less money went to building new companies and it was harder for existing firms to borrow, as investors went elsewhere for better returns. That is correct - and it would have had its impact - though that impact would have basically been the slowdown of new venture backed firms, not layoffs at the Big Tech Giants - and that did in fact happen. (There is definitely a knock-on effect at the Big Tech Giants where a lack of tech startups does bad things to the large parts of the ecosystem - but that effect is not as immediate as it was back in in the 2000 dot com crash.) But there’s a much more immediate bottom line reason. Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code governs the tax treatment of research and development (R&D) expenditures. For roughly 70 years, American companies could deduct 100% of “qualified research and development spending” in the year they incurred the costs, and this was generally interpreted pretty liberally. Salaries, software, contractor payments… if it contributed to creating or improving a product, it could be deducted “off the top” of a firm’s taxable income. The deduction was originally codified by Section 174 of the IRS Code of 1954, and under the provision, R&D flourished in the U.S. It gave us the dominance of Bell Labs, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook - pretty much all the US technology booms you’ve lived through unless you’re quire venerable. So the way these regs are written: These expenditures must be for activities intended to discover information that eliminates uncertainty about the development or improvement of a product. (Kind of open-ended.) Prior to 2022, taxpayers could immediately deduct R&D expenditures in the year they were incurred, providing a significant tax benefit for businesses investing in innovation. Alternatively, taxpayers could capitalize these costs and amortize them over a period (e.g., at least 60 months) if they chose to defer the deduction. But it was pretty rare to do this, because you could directly manage your R&D payroll costs versus income to mitigate the tax hit. And societally, we accepted that - we were investing in growing the American economy. But, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 amended Section 174, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021. Starting in 2022, R&D expenditures must be capitalized and amortized over 5 years for domestic research (and 15 years for foreign research… which is pretty untenable.) This change eliminated the option to immediately deduct R&D costs, increasing tax liability for companies with significant research budgets in the short term. Even more annoying, amortization begins at the midpoint of the taxable year in which the expenses are incurred, using a straight-line method. The short version is: this rule change has increased taxable income for businesses in the short term, as they can no longer deduct R&D costs immediately. Now, there is actually a category of tax law which you can still use (IRS Section 41 Research and Development Tax Credits) which are different - if you think I’m about to advocate tax reform, yes, but I’m always doing that and I feel like I’m talking to a brick wall. But it’s not as broadly useful, and it’s not a simple recategorization, or we’d all have done it. Anyway, let me see if I can summarize how it works today. A U.S. company incurs $1 million in domestic R&D (Section 174) expenses in 2025 and let’s assume they can’t reasonably reclassify any of it under Section 41. Under Section 174, it must capitalize these costs and amortize them over 5 years. Amortization begins mid-year, so in 2025, the company can deduct $100,000 (1/10th of $1 million, since you only get to count half the first year. The remaining $900,000 is deducted evenly over the next 4.5 years ($200,000 per year). These are basically “tax credits”. So in some respects, they may be long term beneficial - but they are a short term drag, which is why you see layoffs at the moment. Also they create a lot more compliance paperwork (and potentially you’ll see companies change hands just for their accumulated tax credits, which is a little… unhelpful.) And of course, this hit the “real world” of companies focused on building tomorrow’s products in some pretty obvious ways. The inability to immediately deduct R&D costs reduced cash flow, particularly for cash-strapped startups and small tech firms reliant on R&D. Companies had to either take out high-interest loans - since of course, interest rates have recently gone up, cut costs, or face bankruptcy. Many chose layoffs to free up cash to cover these tax liabilities. For instance, a small company might lay off a software engineer earning $200,000 to cover a $189,000 tax bill. Now, you might think the 15-year amortization period for foreign R&E expenditures would make hiring non-U.S. engineers less tax-advantageous and help bring jobs back to the US, but this mostly did not actually work out this way. You see, larger companies responded by offshoring R&D to countries with more favorable tax regimes, leading to U.S. job losses. For example, Google reportedly shifted some work to Germany, and Microsoft moved a bunch of research work to China - both because pay rates were better and because the local subsidiary company in that jurisdiction operated under the national laws for that nation, which … were not the US tax laws. They were much more like the previous US tax laws, because the rest of the world had realized “hey, we also want to encourage people to invest in R&D and grow the next trillion dollar company here!” And this new tax ruling doesn’t precisely say “we don’t want to do that” but it does say “we don’t want you to be quick about it” - which everyone who believes in the Amazing Growth Story thinks is anathema to their strategy. Anyway, the impact of this tax strategy turned out to be: layoffs of U.S.-based engineers while companies restructured operations abroad. Now back in 2017, when Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the signature legislative achievement of President Donald Trump’s first term, it slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which looked like a massive revenue loss “on paper” for the federal government. So in order to make the 2017 bill comply with Senate budget rules, lawmakers had to offset the cost… therefore, they put in a future tax hike (well, several) that wouldn’t kick in right away, wouldn’t provoke immediate backlash from businesses, and could, in theory, be quietly repealed later. The delayed change to Section 174, from immediate expensing of R&D to “mandatory amortization”, meaning that companies must spread the deduction out in smaller chunks over five or even 15-year periods… that’s one of them, as I’m sure you’ve figured out. The delayyed start meant that it would not begin affecting the budget until 2022, but it helped the TCJA appear “deficit neutral” over the 10-year window used for legislative “scoring”. The delay wasn’t legally required, mind you, it was a way to game the system. These kind of political tactics are commononplace in tax legislation. Phase-ins and or delayed-start provisions let lawmakers game how the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) - Congress’ nonpartisan analyst of how bills impact budgets and deficits - “grades” legislation, because it kicks the costs down the road, outside the “official” forecasting windows. Those of you who play table-top games or RPGs would call this a way to “cheese the system” or the traditional euphemism used to be something along the lines of “robbing Peter to pay Paul”. Many businesses expected Congress to repeal or delay the Section 174 changes before they took effect in 2022, as there definitely was bipartisan support for immediate expensing. However, inaction led to a “shock” when 2022 tax bills arrived in 2023, forcing rapid cost-cutting, including layoffs. Small software firms, in particular, faced “extinction-level” tax bills, with some reporting taxable income tripling overnight, prompting layoffs or salary cuts. And bigger firms - Amazon, Meta/Facebook, Alphabet/Google, etc, Microsoft, Salesforce, etc - have had widespread layoffs in the US and have moved jobs overseas. Twilio cut 22% of its domestic workforce in 2023. Shopify cut 30% (they’re based in Canada, but much of their R&D was in the US - guess what, it isn’t anymore). Coinbase cut 36% of their team and there are still a heck of a lot of crypto bros, so I think they are probably not in a doomsday situation. Now, I don’t want to say this was the only thing in 2023 that did this. There was a lot of economic turmoil on the horizon then: rising interest rates, reduced venture capital funding, supply chain problems, and post-pandemic over-hiring corrections, all amplifying financial pressures at the time. Companies like Meta announced layoffs during their “Year of Efficiency” in 2023, partly due to these tax changes and corresponding changes in ad spending. While not the sole cause, the Section 174 change drove (or accelerated) layoffs that otherwise would probably have been unnecessary. Congress has made noise previously about a bipartisan reversal of this tax code change, and I rather hope they do - it would be a welcome boost to many sectors of the American economy, from manufacturing to pharmaceutical to technology to education to electrnics to scientific research and consulting. Don’t think of this as just a problem for the tech space. I mean, the tech sector is ridiculously dominant for the S&P 500, the “Magnificent Seven” are a third of the value of the S&P 500. (That’s Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, and Tesla.) But if this does get repealed - it will be very good for those seven stocks - this is not an official stock tip, shush, you SEC guys. Throughout the 2010s, a broad swath of startups, direct-to-consumer brands, and internet-first firms… heck, basically every company that you would recognize from Instagram or Facebook ads… built their growth models around a kind of synthetic carefully engineered break-even. Lot of online firms, a lot of handheld or wearable tech firms, personal entertainment devices, ride-hailing firms, anything self-driving, all the recent buzzy things. The tax code allowed them to spend aggressively on product and engineering, then write it all off as R&D, keeping their taxable income close to zero by design. It worked because taxable income and actual cash flow were often not quite the same thing under what’s known as GAAP accounting practices. Basically, as long as spending counted as R&D, companies could report losses to investors while owing almost nothing to the IRS. In short, it costs a lot to invent - and market - the future. Building a better tomorrow can be expensive! Investors generally bought into this, gave them another round of venture capital, and let them defer a public offering. (This is actually another problem with this model - companies have stayed private far too long - but I’ll address that at some other point.) But the Section 174 tax change absolutely cratered that model. Once those same expenses had to be spread out, or amortized, over multiple years, suddenly you couldn’t write these off - basically, the tax shield vanished or the accounting rules changed, depending on how politely you want to phrase it. But the mechanics of it are the same: companies that were still burning cash suddenly looked profitable on paper, triggering real tax bills on imaginary gains. (If this reminds you of some of the past economic crises - it should - this is one of the things that burned people back in the dotcom crash of 2000 amongst other mark-to-market problems in 2008, though the 2008 crisis mostly wasn’t this.) The logic that once fueled a generation of digital-first research-focused growth ran straight into a IRS-shaped brick wall and put a mighty dent in the work force. If you were already public and profitable - well, your management team wasn’t going let you suddenly become unprofitable just because of a tax law change, so the answer was “cut expenses” and that mostly became “slow CapEx on data centers - servers are expensive - and lay off employees” so as to preserve profit margins and keep the stock price high. After all, reasoned management, if we had to put up with these crazy new rules, we basically just had to bank up R&D credits for a few years and then we were back to par. It was a couple of years of drag on the economy - and a particularly bad time to fall behind on technology leadership or a chance to reshore manufacturing or stabilize the American economy. One suspects that the current administration, if they had noticed that, might have kicked out a repeal or other clever plan as part of their new budget package (what’s currently being bundled together under the slightly goofy name of the Big Beautiful Bill) to juice economic recovery. So it wasn’t just tech experiencing effects. From 1954 until 2022, the U.S. tax code had encouraged businesses of all stripes to behave at least a little bit like we think of tech companies behaving, by which I mean “investing in R&D” and more generally “investing in software” for the latter half of that. From retail to logistics, healthcare to media, if firms built internal tools, customized a software stack, or invested in business intelligence and data-driven product development, they could expense those costs - and the IRS generally agreed, which is slightly miraculous. The write-off incentivized in-house builds and fast growth well outside what people generally call the “tech sector”. For comparison, check the OECD research showing that immediate deductions foster innovation more than spread-out ones. And American companies loved that logic and invested according to it. According to government data, U.S. businesses reported about $500 billion in R&D expenditures in 2019 alone, and almost half of that came from industries outside traditional tech. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that this sector, the broader digital economy, accounts for another 10% of GDP. Probably 20% if you count Big Tech. And there’s a secondary market - all the people who support and are downstream from those workers and those industries (see below); we’re actually introducing relatively-avoidable friction into about a quarter of the American economy here with this particular tax change. The result? A tax policy aimed at raising short-term revenue basically defined the growth engine for a huge chunk of American companies. But when that rug got pulled out, it also yanked out the incentive for hiring American engineers or investing in American-made tech and digital products. It made building tech companies in America suddenly not economically viable, and the last time we did this with a stupid policy change (Fed policy tightening “to defeat the Wealth Effect” and cool down speculative fervor … yup, it sure did! Lots of wealth went away, was that a good idea?) caused the big Dot Com Crash in 2000. It would probably be a good idea to put this tax credit back in place (or some facsimile thereof) before it continues to strip jobs out of the American economy - let alone all the folks (realtors, contractors, restaurants, nannies, tutors, personal trainers, et al) that are one step downstream from the tech sector jobs. Thanks for reading! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. This entire tech-layoff wave is about more than AI or plummeting demand. It’s the delayed bomb Congress planted in Section 174 (a stealth tax that reclassified every developer’s salary as R&D amortized over years, not the quick write-off it used to be). People inside big firms are collateral damage in a tax strategy. The policy also shoved engineers’ families onto the payroll chopping block. Until lawmakers reverse course, U.S. tech is bleeding talent - nail in coffin for innovation here while other countries scoop up the scraps. This needs to be shouted from every rooftop. Everyone needs to write, call, and email their representatives and senators to address this issue. No posts Ready for more?

According to the June 12 announcement, developers and institutions will now be able to easily mint and redeem USDC tokens on the XRP Ledger following the unexpected integration. The integration makes it easy to access USDC liquidity and benefit from the XRPL’s fast and secure network. USDC is currently the industry’s second-largest stablecoin with a market cap of $61 billion, trailing only Tether’s USDT. This latest development marks another milestone in USDC’s expansion across multiple blockchains, bringing its coverage to 22 chains, including Solana, Ethereum, and recently, Sam Altman’s World Chain. Notably, Ripple also joined the stablecoin gold rush, with the rollout of its own highly regulated RLUSD stablecoin last December. The token, which rivals USDC and USDT, currently has a paltry market cap of $412 million. USDC issuer Circle made its trading debut on the New York Stock Exchange last week, but nothing could have braced Wall Street for the company’s dynamite initial public offering (IPO). The IPO, which raised $1.1 billion for the firm and early shareholders, surpassed the initial performance of major publicly traded tech companies such as Meta, Robinhood, and Airbnb upon their respective listings. Crypto commentators pointed to the market’s fundamental belief that the GENIUS Act — the landmark U.S. stablecoin legislation — will pass as a key driver for the success of Circle’s IPO. Before the IPO, it was rumored that Ripple had attempted to acquire Circle for at least $5 billion, but the bid was rejected as too low. However, as ZyCrypto covered recently, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse disregarded claims that it planned to acquire Circle.

Title: Nintendo Switch 2 review: A fun console with tons of potential, but where are the exclusive games?

Compared to other Nintendo consoles, the Switch 2 is an outlier. It's the first Nintendo system that feels like a direct, no-frills upgrade to its predecessor. It looks similar, it doesn't require new controllers, and it even plays 99% of the original Switch's library. It's a sequel, which is rare for such an innovation-focused company. This lack of innovation gives the Switch 2 its greatest strengths and worst flaws. On the one hand, the system carries over everything I loved about the original console, including its massive library and iconic blend of handheld and TV gaming. But on the other hand, it offers what ultimately amounts to a similar gaming experience at jacked-up prices. I've spent more than a week with the Nintendo Switch 2, playing a variety of games every day. Although I consider it a no-brainer purchase for players who never bought a Switch, I'm not convinced it's worth upgrading from the original. At least, not yet. I'm confident the Switch 2 will eventually become an even better console than the Switch 1, but it needs more exclusive games to get there. See also: Nintendo Switch 2 vs. Nintendo Switch 1 Like the original Switch, the Nintendo Switch 2 can be used as a handheld gaming system or connected to your TV at home. This new model has more powerful hardware and supports 4K resolution, HDR, and 120 FPS gaming. Specifics Like the original Switch, the Switch 2 is a handheld system that can also be placed in a dock to use with a TV at home. The Switch 2's built-in screen is nearly two inches bigger than the original console's, and when combined with a higher resolution — up to 1080p from the original's 720p — the comparison is night and day. Small details are easier to see, and tiny text takes less time to decipher. However, this is an LCD screen rather than an OLED one. Nintendo released an OLED version of the original Switch in 2021, and this type of screen offers higher contrast. That said, this new display's colors are still noticeably more vibrant than the standard Switch's LCD. The improved image quality is in part due to the screen's support for high dynamic range (HDR), a feature that the Switch 1 didn't have. HDR enables enhanced contrast and a wider range of colors. Though the Switch 2's backlight isn't bright or precise enough to showcase the full impact of what HDR can do, it still benefits from this feature. You can learn more in our HDR guide. I'm excited to see more games take advantage of the console's 120Hz refresh rate (up from 60Hz on the original Switch) and the dock's 4K output for Ultra HD gaming on a 4K TV. The higher refresh rate can provide smoother motion, while the higher resolution offers a sharper, more detailed picture. There's only one game released so far that goes up to 120 FPS, the "Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour" tech demo, and it does indeed look very smooth. The creatively named Joy-Con 2 controllers are a mixed bag. They're larger than the original controllers, making them feel less cramped in your hands. They also connect to the Switch 2 magnetically, which is more convenient than the original's physical rails, albeit a bit flimsier feeling. It's a worthwhile tradeoff. But for whatever reason, Nintendo built them with the same problematic joystick parts that caused the infamous "Joy-Con Drift" issue on the original system. This flaw is a ticking time bomb that'll crop up more frequently as time goes on, so keep an eye on your controllers for symptoms. Each Joy-Con 2 can also be used as an optical mouse, but few games take advantage of this feature so far. When I used it, the mouse sensors were accurate and responsive, but the controller felt a bit too thin to handle as comfortably as a real mouse. Where the Nintendo Switch 2 truly shines is in its performance, and not just with Switch 2 games. Like its predecessor, the Switch 2 runs on a custom-made Nvidia chip. It's hard to compare the chip to any other system like-for-like, but most hardware breakdowns describe the Switch 2 as a mobile PlayStation 4. That might not sound like much, but it's a big improvement over the original Switch's underpowered hardware and opens the door to a wide variety of big-budget AAA titles. Graphically intensive games, like "Cyberpunk 2077," which were impossible to run on an original Switch, are now available on the Switch 2. "Cyberpunk 2077" still doesn't run perfectly, but it's more than playable. The most shocking aspect of the Switch 2's performance is how it improves games made for the original console: The load times in "Splatoon 3" and "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom" have shrunk to only a few seconds. Fast travel in "Pokémon Sword" is near-instantaneous, and the normally lag-filled "Pokémon Scarlet" runs at a smooth 60 FPS. Some "Super Smash Bros. Ultimate" matches start before the game can even show which characters are fighting. The Switch 2 has become the ultimate way to experience original Switch games, even if they don't have a dedicated "Switch 2 Edition" update. If you don't own the original console and you've been wanting to play these games, this makes the Switch 2 an obvious buy. This improved performance does come with downsides, though. Most notable is the reduced battery life, which is down to an estimated two to 6.5 hours from the original's 4.5 to nine. Both also take more than five minutes to turn on after being plugged in to charge, which is a major blow to the console's portability. I ran a test comparing the Switch 2 to my 2018 original model, seeing how long they could last running "Tears of the Kingdom" in a busy in-game area with the camera endlessly spinning. The brand-new Switch 2 lasted about two hours and fifty minutes, while I logged about two hours and thirty-five minutes on my original Switch. Though the Switch 2 did last slightly longer in this test, it's important to note that my original system has a seven-year-old, heavily used battery. With that in mind, the comparison is disappointing. As of this writing, the Switch 2 only has two exclusive Nintendo games: "Mario Kart World" and "Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour." They're leagues apart in quality. "Mario Kart World" is the best game in the series so far. The most fun part of any "Mario Kart" race is the chaotic first few seconds when everyone is jockeying for an early lead, and the new Knockout Tour mode, which turns the race into a battle royale, makes that chaos last the entire match. There's no such thing as a comfortable lead — you're always in danger of getting bumped to the bottom of the pack. It also boasts a wonderfully diverse set of characters, most of whom have multiple unlockable costumes or forms; an updated trick system that lets you ride on walls and charge boosts at any time; and some incredible tracks, including a beautiful new version of Rainbow Road that's both the longest course in series history, and feels more like a shared boss battle than a racetrack. The graphics are crisp, and load times are short. It's also got a banger soundtrack that references and remixes songs from throughout the "Mario" franchise. But is it worth buying a Switch 2 for? By itself, I wouldn't say so. For all its new features, the basics of "Mario Kart" haven't changed, and I don't expect the original Switch's "Mario Kart 8" multiplayer servers to empty out anytime soon. Wait for more exclusives — and, hopefully, for "Mario Kart World" to go on sale. "Nintendo Switch Welcome Tour," meanwhile, presents itself as a quirky way to learn more about your system, but in reality, it's more of a chore than a fun instruction manual. To progress from area to area, you need to collect stamps, which are gathered by running up to each of the Switch 2's individual buttons/ports and pressing "A" to open a pop-up that tells you what they're called. There's no indication of which stamps you're missing, which leads to situations where you're sprinting around a giant Joy-Con, desperately checking every corner to figure out what buttons you missed. The mini-games are amusing but one-note, and the quizzes, which require you to read dozens of pages of explanations on how the Switch 2 was built and works, are boring. If "Welcome Tour" was a free pack-in with the system, none of this would be much of an issue, but it costs $10. My advice? Just watch a playthrough on YouTube. GameChat is the Switch 2's voice and video-chatting app. It's free until 2026, at which point you'll need a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pass membership to use it. Nintendo has hyped it up as one of the console's biggest selling points. Going in, I was pretty negative on GameChat. I figured it'd be like Nintendo's past attempts at online chat: Clunky and unintuitive. I also thought it'd pale in comparison to a free service like Discord. I'm happy to say that I was wrong! Setting up a GameChat session with my friend took only a few seconds, although waiting for them to actually connect once they accept the invite takes some time. The choppy screen sharing looks bad at first, but in practice, really wasn't noticeable. And the system's built-in microphone has some shockingly good noise cancellation. Even when I ran a hair dryer at full blast only a few feet away, my friend couldn't hear it, but made out my voice perfectly. GameChat isn't as feature-rich as Discord, but it doesn't need to be. It's made for quick, casual multiplayer sessions, not long-term communication. I expect it'll also be popular with kids, since it's encased in its own ecosystem, making it safer than a random Discord server. I didn't have a compatible webcam to test out the video-chatting function, but testing from The Verge has found mixed results when connecting third-party webcams. There doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason to which cams work and which don't. But when they do work, video evidence from other players shows that the feeds are pretty smooth. Now, the elephant in the room: The Switch 2 costs $450, which is $100 more than the Switch OLED, $150 more than the standard Switch, and comparable to both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles. It's also $100 more expensive than the cheapest Steam Deck, which is the most popular non-Nintendo handheld gaming system. The Switch 2's price isn't unreasonable compared to its competitors from rival brands. But this high cost makes it the most expensive Nintendo console yet, and it might mean that Nintendo's reign as the choice for gamers on a budget is ending. The price of games is getting higher, too. "Mario Kart World" costs $80, and that's not going to be a rare occurrence. Add in the cost of a Nintendo Switch Online subscription ($20 to $50 a year, depending on your plan), and the budget starts to get frighteningly tight. And that's before you consider buying any Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, like microSD Express cards, screen protectors, cases, controllers, and cameras. Obviously, everyone has a different financial situation. But at a time when prices are rising across the board, it's hard to justify spending so much on a relatively incremental upgrade of a console. If you already own a Nintendo Switch, then no, the Switch 2 isn't worth it just yet. The system doesn't have enough exclusive games right now, so most of your library will be titles you could have played already without spending more money. And because there aren't many exclusives that take advantage of the system's new graphical features, the Switch 2's 120 FPS and 4K resolution upgrades aren't that important. And while the new design is fantastic, it's not worth $450. The system simply hasn't justified its price. But if you never hopped on the Switch train, now's a great time to buy your ticket. That is, if you can find one in stock. Buying a Switch 2 gives you immediate access to a massive library of games, including original Switch classics like "Super Mario Odyssey," new experiences like "Mario Kart World," and remastered ports like "Street Fighter 6." There are also loads of new games coming in the next year, including the open-world RPG "Pokémon Legends: Z-A" and the highly anticipated first-person adventure "Metroid Prime 4." All this is to say that, yes, the Nintendo Switch 2 is a great console. And a year or two from now, it might just be the best product Nintendo has ever released. But right now, it's an inessential upgrade. It's the best choice for new players who never bought an original Switch, but overpriced for existing Switch owners.

Title: The World’s Largest Meatpacker Jumps On First Day Of NYSE Trading
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/chloesorvino/2025/06/13/the-worlds-largest-meatpacker-jumps-on-first-day-of-nyse-trading/

ByChloe Sorvino ByChloe Sorvino, Forbes Staff. In the first hours since the world’s largest meatpacker began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday under the ticker JBS, the stock had a slow start before ending the day up nearly 5%. The addition of American investors has been expected to help the Brazilian conglomerate with $77 billion in 2024 revenue from processing and selling beef, pork, chicken and lamb to more than 100 countries. During the first day of trading, shares rose around 3% before briefly falling past where the stock opened at $13.65 per share at around 2:30 p.m eastern. As of the close of markets, the stock was back up and hit a high $14.29, or around 5% up. The market capitalization of JBS was more than $31 billion. And the billionaire sons of the founder, who guided the expansion of JBS beyond Brazil—and went to jail seven years ago after its American acquisition spree got ensnared in a massive corruption scandal involving 1,800 politicians in their homeland—are now richer for it. As JBS stock rose, the net worths of Joesley and Wesley Batista increased an estimated $200 million each. The brothers, who are the top shareholders in the company and serve as board directors, are now worth $4.8 billion each. Together, through family holding companies, they own nearly 50% of JBS. Billionaires Wesley (left) and Joesley Batista are the top shareholders of JBS, the world's largest meatpacker, which began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. Joesley and Wesley Batista, 53 and 52 respectively, were personally charged with foreign corruption in the U.S. as well as insider trading allegations in Brazil (related to the timing of the news of their bribery scheme) that saw them briefly jailed in Brazil for about six months from 2017 to 2018. In all, the Batistas and one of their holding companies agreed to more than three dozen incidents of bribery in Brazil, according to their 2017 cooperation agreements with the Brazilian government. And the U.S. Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission found evidence of some $150 million in kickback when the Batistas and their holding company, J&F Investimentos, pled guilty to U.S. foreign corruption charges in 2020. J&F paid a $128 million criminal fine as part of a settlement with the Department of Justice. J&F also paid $27 million over foreign corruption charges with the SEC. At the same time, the Batista brothers, who are Brazilian citizens, settled a civil penalty with the SEC and paid $550,000 each. Until 2025, there had been a bipartisan effort to stop the U.S. listing on the NYSE. Last year, 15 senators—including Republicans Josh Hawley of Missouri and John Barrasso of Wyoming as well as Democrats Cory Booker of New Jersey, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts—denounced a potential IPO. Years prior, former Florida Senator Marco Rubio, now Secretary of State, was one of JBS’ loudest critics and twice requested a broad investigation by the Treasury Department into the Batistas and their assets. The long-delayed SEC approval for JBS’ dual-listing came just two days after the Trump Administration’s new SEC chairman was sworn into office. The SEC approval also came two days after it was revealed in a public filing with the federal election commission that the largest donor to the Trump Inaugural Committee was the JBS subsidiary, chicken processor Pilgrim’s Pride. The $5 million donation to Trump’s Inauguration was five times larger than the checks given by Amazon, Meta, Uber, Nvidia and Microsoft, which each gave $1 million. A JBS spokesperson has denied any link in the timing of the donation. The Trump Administration did not return request for comment. Allowing JBS to trade in the U.S. is likely bad news for America’s homegrown—and largest overall—meatpacker, Tyson. With a market capitalization of just under $20 billion, Tyson is slightly bigger than JBS in beef and chicken, but its stock price has been struggling, down 8%, in the past three months. Tyson has historically traded at around double the multiple of JBS, but analysts expect the addition of JBS to an American stock exchange to change that, which means JBS will have more buying power, and the competition is on. “Food is a national security issue,” says Carlos Laboy, the lead analyst on JBS at HSBC. “It benefits the United States to have the largest protein company in the world not only operated in the U.S. but listed in the U.S. and with the oversight of U.S. regulators. The alternative scenarios are not favorable to the U.S.”

Title: Meta Invests $14.3 Billion in Scale AI as Zuckerberg Builds New Artificial Intelligence Team

Scale CEO and co-founder Alexandr Wang will lead Meta’s new “Superintelligence” division following the deal Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said earlier this year that his company will be investing heavily in artificial intelligence in 2025. And on Thursday, he put his money where his mouth is, with the parent company of Facebook and Instagram investing $14.3 billion in Scale AI, a company that offers a platform and training data for developing AI models. The investment values Scale AI at more than $29 billion, the San Francisco-based company said in a blog post. As part of the deal, 28-year-old Alexandr Wang, Scale’s chief executive and co-founder, will join Meta to spearhead its new AI research division now dubbed the “Superintelligence” lab. Meta’s stock was down 0.77% on Friday, the morning after the deal was officially announced, to $688 per share. The company’s stock price is up about 15% since the start of the year. The tech giant’s stake in Scale AI — its second-largest deal ever, after the $19 billion it spent to buy WhatsApp in 2014 — reinforces Zuckerberg’s claim that AI is a key focus for Meta moving forward. Zuckerberg in January said Meta would spend between $60 billion and $65 billion to “significantly” expand its AI team; the company then updated that projection during its first quarter earnings call in April, saying it planned on spending up to $72 billion this year on AI. “This will be a defining year for AI,” Zuckerberg said in January. “I expect Meta AI will be the leading assistant serving more than 1 billion people, Llama 4 will become the leading state of the art model, and we’ll build an AI engineer that will start contributing increasing amounts of code to our research and development efforts.” The new superintelligence division will be separate from Reality Labs, Meta’s division that has been focused on virtual reality, augmented reality and AI. That division has stood out as one sector where Meta is spending more than it is making; the company reported it lost $4.21 billion on Reality Labs during the first quarter, while Meta overall reported $42.31 billion in sales.

Title: The Prototype: Space Company Voyager’s Stock Soars On IPO

ByAlex Knapp ByAlex Knapp, Forbes Staff. In this week’s edition of The Prototype, we look at a big space stock IPO, Korea’s plan to dominate the world of robots, building electric motors without metal and more. You can sign up to get The Prototype in your inbox here. Dylan Taylor, chairman and CEO of Voyager Technologies Inc. Space company Voyager Technologies brought in nearly $383 million in its IPO on Wednesday, with shares priced at $31. The company offers a number of different space services for both governments and commercial customers, including services on board the International Space Station. Its stock price soared upon the opening of trading, hitting a sky-high $63.88 at one point on Wednesday. It’s since come back down to Earth a bit, closing at $49.70 yesterday, giving it a market cap of over $2.7 billion. The company plans to use the increased capital to expand a number of its offerings, particularly Starlab, a private space station the company is developing for use after the International Space Station is decommissioned. Investors hope this success might lead to more IPOs in the space sector this year. P.S. - Quick housekeeping note: There will be no edition of the Prototype next week, as I will be off for the holiday. See you all back here on the 27th! Joe Buglewicz/AP In 2021 Hyundai Motor Company paid $1.1 billion to acquire 80% of robotics pioneer Boston Dynamics, famous for videos of its dog-shaped bot named Spot and its running and jumping humanoid Atlas. The deal initially seemed more of a headline grab for Hyundai rather than part of a fully baked strategy. That’s no longer the case. Four years later, Hyundai now represents the tip of the spear in Korea Inc.’s thrust into robotics. The company has continued to develop Spot, especially for use as a roving site inspector, and is also iterating on Atlas, with the intention of selling mass-produced humanoids controlled by AI as soon as 2028. Hyundai’s robotics lab has already deployed its X-ble platform of wearable robotic exoskeletons for use in factories. X-ble Shoulder, launched late last year after trials with 300 workers, is said to reduce shoulder and deltoid muscle exertions by more than 30% when lifting heavy objects like car parts. Its X-ble MEX is a more complicated rehabilitation suit that can help people walk again. Incredibly, these X-ble exoskeletons don’t require an outside power source, instead using passive spring-torque mechanics. Industrial robots are nothing new to Korea, which already leads the world in density of robot deployment, with 1,000 bots per 10,000 factory workers, compared to about 300 in the U.S. and 470 in China. But now its industries and government see a massive opportunity for robots outside the factory. A new public-private partnership, the K-Humanoid Alliance, aims to offer a commercially viable bipedal bot by 2028 that weighs less than 130 pounds, can lift 40 pounds, walk about 3 yards per second and can move with the flexibility enabled by more than 50 joints. The K-Humanoid Alliance also seeks to develop a common AI “brain” that all Korean robots can use. Read the whole story at Forbes. A team at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology has invented an electric motor that doesn’t use any metal. Instead, its main electric components are made from carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which are lighter than metals but just as electrically conductive. Use of this material has been proposed in the past, but has been hampered by the fact that making CNTs involves metals, and the residue left behind ends up degrading electrical performance. The researchers figured out a way to remove those metal particles with a chemical process that didn’t disrupt the CNT’s structure. The European Space Agency's Solar Orbiter spacecraft has sent back the first clear images of the sun’s south pole. The unique views of the sun were captured on March 16-17, when the Solar Orbiter was orbiting the sun from 15 degrees below the solar equator, enabling this first look. The spacecraft’s three cameras provide images of the sun in visible light, ultraviolet light, and light emanating from different temperatures of charged gas above the sun’s surface, revealing distinct layers of the sun’s atmosphere. In my other newsletter, InnovationRx, Amy Feldman and I wrote about RFK Jr.’s vaccine advisory committee purge, a tech billionaire’s funding of research on AI and healthcare, FDA approval of a new medicine that prevents RSV in infants and digital health company Omada’s IPO. On the Forbes YouTube channel, I spoke with my colleague Brittany Lewis about the potential science impacts of the Trump Administration’s proposed budget cuts to NASA as well as the potential consequences of HHS Secretary Kennedy firing all members of a key vaccine advisory committee. Researchers developed a new kind of paint that can passively cool buildings. It does this in two ways. First, its color reflects sunlight, which is a well-known technique. But it also incorporates nanoparticles that make the paint more porous, so that it captures more water when it’s wet. When that water evaporates, it cools down the building, working the same way sweat does to cool down your body. NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope took new photos of Uranus, giving scientists new insights about the seventh planet. One surprise: Its magnetic field doesn’t interact with its moons. IBM is aiming to have the first practical quantum computer built by 2028. It will comprise modular units each containing quantum chipsets, and the company says it has figured out scalable error correction, one of the major issues holding quantum computing back. Satellite company Kymeta developed a single antenna that can communicate across multiple satellite frequency bands. Until now, a satellite had to be outfitted with multiple antennas to do this, so this could lay a foundation for more seamless satellite communications. A gene therapy for hemophilia is still safe and effective, over a decade after it is first administered. A new study found that 10 patients who received it between 2010 and 2012 still showed the benefits of their one-time treatment, with few side effects. An analysis of over 3,500 companies across Europe over a span of 20 years found that firms that are newly-listed on the stock market will see a quick boost of profit compared to private companies that abandon their plans to IPO. The researchers also found that those companies see an increase in sales per employee and greater market expansion following going public as well. “Going public may unlock growth potential, provided market conditions are favourable,” researcher Francisco Urzua said in a press release about the study. The great rock musician Brian Wilson passed away earlier this week at the age of 82. To commemorate his legacy, Rolling Stone enshrined 25 of his essential songs, and I can’t quibble with any of their picks. My own personal top five: “God Only Knows”, “I Just Wasn’t Made For These Times”, “Good Vibrations”, “Wouldn’t It Be Nice?” and the utterly transcendent “Love And Mercy.” He may be gone now, but he’s left behind an incredible catalog of music.

Title: Forbes Daily: Israel Strikes Iran As Trump Pushes For A Nuclear Deal

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. President Donald Trump has touted his $5 million “Gold Card” visa as a way to raise trillions of dollars for the U.S. But a new website launching the initiative doesn’t look or feel like a legitimate government site, experts say. Among the red flags are the URL itself, unexpected links to the Department of Commerce rather than Homeland Security, and no disclaimer regarding usage of personal data. “This is a joke,” says immigration and investing expert Nuri Katz. “[The Trump Administration] is asking very wealthy individuals to trust a one-page website that feels like it was created in five minutes by a teenager in his bedroom.” And while Trump told his social media followers that the waitlist for the Gold Card was open, it could take years for applications to be processed. Congress has yet to initiate any changes to immigration and tax law that the program would require. AP Photo/Vahid Salemi Israel launched a series of major military strikes against Iran and its nuclear program late on Thursday, killing several top military officials and nuclear scientists in the country, a move that U.S. officials said was a “unilateral” action by Israel as they denied any involvement by U.S. forces. President Donald Trump urged Iran to make a nuclear deal or face “more brutal” attacks in the future. Global crude oil prices jumped sharply, while U.S. stock futures fell early Friday in the wake of the strikes, which marked a significant escalation of tensions in the Middle East. A federal judge ruled Thursday that President Donald Trump must return control of the California National Guard troops deployed in Los Angeles back to the state’s Governor Gavin Newsom, but an appeals court later temporarily blocked the judge’s order. In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said Trump’s deployment of the National Guard, which was done without Newsom’s approval, was illegal, “exceeding the scope of his statutory authority and violating the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.” Shares of Boeing fell 5% Thursday after a plane operated by Air India crashed shortly following takeoff, killing more than 260 people aboard as well as others on the ground, and adding to the safety concerns that the airplane maker has faced for years. Boeing said it was in contact with Air India, and the aircraft involved with the crash was a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner delivered to Air India in 2014. Digital bank Chime’s stock popped in its debut on the Nasdaq Thursday, rising 37% and bringing its valuation to $16 billion, the latest successful IPO in recent weeks. The 13-year-old bank grew rapidly during the pandemic, and while it maintained that expansion, it spent heavily to get there—making it critical for Chime to find cheaper ways to attract and retain customers. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison overtook Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg to become the second-richest person in the world Thursday, as shares of his cloud computing giant surged amid the AI arms race. Ellison enjoyed the largest daily fortune boost of any billionaire, with his net worth climbing by $25 billion to $242 billion, second only behind his longtime friend Elon Musk. Two long-tenured partners at Y Combinator, which has incubated some of the most successful companies in Silicon Valley—from Airbnb to Dropbox—are leaving the firm to start their own fund, Forbes has learned. While the size of the fund, intended to nurture early stage companies, hasn’t been announced, one source said it will be substantially north of $250 million. Major platforms like Google Cloud and Spotify experienced technical issues on Thursday amid a widespread internet outage, though social media platforms appeared to be largely spared. Cloudflare, which serves tens of millions of web requests per second, said in the afternoon that a number of services suffering “intermittent failures” were being investigated, but later in the day, said services were fully restored. Despite his real estate empire, a majority of President Donald Trump’s fortune—$3.3 billion of his total $5.5 billion—is now tied to crypto, which the president has tapped for cash and worked to promote. The latest shift was when Trump Media and Technology Group purchased crypto to bolster its balance sheet, transforming Trump’s company from a social-media play to a Bitcoin bet. FBI officers physically removed Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., from a press conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles on Thursday as he attempted to shout questions at Noem, an incident that drew bipartisan backlash. Noem falsely claimed in a Fox News interview after the incident that Padilla “started launching towards the podium” and “did not identify himself.” Megan Briggs/Getty Images When Lionel Messi laces up his cleats to compete in the FIFA Club World Cup that begins Saturday, the Argentine soccer superstar will be the highest-paid player there, with $135 million in estimated earnings over the past 12 months. He’ll be joined by other top earners like Real Madrid forward Kylian Mbappé and Manchester City striker Erling Haaland, a confluence of top-earning talent that is a direct result of FIFA’s new format for the tournament. The FAA is investigating a JetBlue flight that skidded off the runway at Boston Logan International Airport, and the airport was under a ground delay Thursday afternoon. The carrier said no one was injured in the incident, which occurred on a flight that originated from Chicago O’Hare International Airport. Drew Angerer/Getty Images Scale AI’s shocking $15 billion deal to sell a 49% stake to Meta has raised the specter that the startup’s $14 billion-valued data labeling business could implode. At play is the concern that Scale, which has been the dominant player in labeling data to help major tech companies and AI startups train their models, could share details about the types of data that leading AI players have used to build their most cutting edge tech with Meta. OpenAI, one of its most prominent customers, has already been winding down its work with Scale, according to four sources with knowledge of its business. Scale AI spokesperson Joe Osborne denied that OpenAI has pulled back its spending. Scale built its business on the back of a massive clickworker army, largely of workers based overseas who would teach AI models by providing context for masses of data. But this kind of work has become a commodity. “Anyone who puts up a team can compete with you, and it comes down to price really quickly,” said Kevin Guo, cofounder of a startup that got out of the data labeling business, in a 2023 interview. WHY IT MATTERS Access to high quality human data is crucial for training powerful AI models, so much so that data has been considered a moat for AI juggernauts like OpenAI and Anthropic in the AI race. Scale AI, which booked $870 million in revenue in 2024, captured the data labeling market early by supplying troves of human-labeled data to companies like Cohere, OpenAI and Microsoft. But Meta owning almost half of Scale would change that equation. MORE How Alexandr Wang Turned An Army Of Clickworkers Into A $7.3 Billion AI Unicorn The House voted to claw back funding from NPR and PBS, in a move known as rescission, as the White House has sought to slash their funding. The legislation will also be considered in the Senate: $9.4 billion: The total amount of the cuts the White House has proposed, including $8.3 billion in funding for USAID September 2027: The date the funds had previously been approved through 15%: The share of PBS’ budget that comes from the federal government Today’s job market is especially tough for entry-level roles, and AI could eliminate up to half of entry-level knowledge work in the next five years, according to Anthropic’s CEO. But rest assured that AI can’t automate creativity and human insight—abilities that haven’t been emphasized in formal training lately. It’s critical for young people to develop skills like storytelling, creative thinking and empathy, and focus on the humanities as core career infrastructure.

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. Opt for AI companies using their competitive advantages to establish leadership positions in big ... More markets. Nvidia was one of the first companies to monetize the AI revolution, but it will not be the last. As AI innovation reshapes business processes, there is ample room for AI software, service and hardware providers to generate meaningful value and wealth — for customers and investors. Identifying which stocks will rise to prominence is the AI investor's big challenge. Below are six strong contenders that are worth a deeper dive. Based on market opportunity, projected results and competitive positioning, one or more of these six AI stocks may be the future star of your growth portfolio: A review of each company follows. For more investing ideas, see best stocks for 2025. Upstart Holdings operates an AI-powered lending marketplace that overhauls the traditional credit-scoring model. The company’s streamlined, all-digital loan applications identify more creditworthy borrowers, improves access to affordable debt and lowers costs for lenders. According to Upstart data, its technology approves 43% more applicants at 33% lower APRs. Upstart quantifies the global credit market at over $25 trillion, with $1 trillion available to origination and servicing platforms. Upstart generated 2024 revenue of $637 million and recorded a net loss of $137 million. In 2025, the company expects $1 billion in revenue and a net loss of $80 million. Per stockanalysis.com, analysts expect the company to generate positive EPS of $1.49 in 2025, rising to over $4.50 by 2029. Upstart stock trades for about $57 per share and is up 138% over the past year. Snowflake operates a cloud-based data warehouse and a platform to access the data for AI and other applications, analytics and collaboration. A Contino review says Snowflake’s platform "enables data storage, processing, and analytic solutions that are faster, easier to use, and far more flexible than traditional offerings." According to Snowflake’s 2025 Investor Day presentation, the company expects its market opportunity to reach $355 billion by calendar year 2029. That's more than double the estimated market size of $170 billion in 2024. Snowflake serves a diverse customer group that includes meal kit company Hello Fresh, German automaker BMW Group and transportation services provider Penske. Customers use Snowflake to support a range of objectives, from cost efficiency to improved customer experiences. In fiscal 2025, Snowflake generated $3.4 billion in revenue and recorded a GAAP operating loss of $1.4 billion. The company expects first-quarter 2026 revenue growth of 21% to 22% with an operating margin of 5%. Analysts expect Snowflake to reach $10 billion in revenue and EPS over $4 in fiscal 2030, according to stockanalysis.com. Snowflake stock trades for about $212 per share and is up 70% over the past year. CrowdStrike operates a cybersecurity solution called Falcon that uses AI to detect and block malware and other digital threats. The company recently announced the release of a new agentic AI with autonomous reasoning and investigative capabilities for faster threat mitigation. CrowdStrike serves more than 70% of Fortune 100 companies and 18 of the top 20 U.S. banks, according to a 2024 investor presentation. The company values the AI-native security platform market at $116 billion. In fiscal 2025, CrowdStrike produced revenue of $3.95 billion and a GAAP operating loss of $120 million. Analysts expect the company to eclipse $10 billion in revenue and $8 in EPS in fiscal 2030, according to stockanalysis.com. CrowdStrike stock trades for about $486 per share and has gained 28% over the past year. The gain is despite a steep stock-price decline last summer, following a failed update that crashed more than 8.5 million systems. Ambarella designs and sells low-power vision processors for use in edge AI applications such as autonomous driving systems, drive recorders, vehicle safety features, surveillance systems and more. Edge AI applications process data locally, rather than sending data to the cloud for processing. As a result, they can produce faster responses with lower power consumption. Power efficiency is a focus for Ambarella—the company says its chips deliver the same or better results while being up to five times more efficient than competitor solutions. A research report from S&S Insider values the edge AI chips market at $21.4 billion in 2024 and projects a CAGR of 33.93% from 2025 to 2032. That translates to a 2032 edge AI chip market worth $221.5 billion. For fiscal 2025, Ambarella reported $284.9 million in revenue and a GAAP net loss of $117 million. Analysts expect the company’s revenue to surpass $500 million and EPS to approach $1.50 in fiscal 2029, according to stockanalysis.com. AMBA stock trades for about $54 and is down 2% over the last year. Arm Holdings designs high-performance, energy-efficient CPUs and GPUs, and then licenses the architecture. Licensees customize Arm designs to suit their applications. According to Arm, its technology is trusted and tested by more than 22 million software developers globally. Arm partners include Nvidia, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Mercedes-Benz and Fujitsu. Arm’s foundational role in chipmaking expedites innovation and time-to-market while lowering hardware acquisition costs for data centers. Prior to its 2023 U.S. IPO, Arm estimated its total addressable market (TAM) was $202.5 billion. The company also projected that its TAM would grow to $246.6 billion by December 31, 2025. In fiscal 2025, Arm reported revenue of $4 billion and diluted EPS of $0.75. Analysts expect the company will produce revenue of $9.8 billion and EPS of $3.95 in fiscal 2030, per stockanalysis.com. ARM stock trades for about $139 per share and is down 8.4% over the past year. The Trade Desk runs an ad-buying platform that offers highly targeted and global audiences across multiple digital channels, including smart TVs. The company uses AI to analyze millions of ad opportunities each second to identify the most valuable and cost-efficient placements. According to company data, the Trade Desk’s AI can increase advertiser reach by three times and reduce cost-per-action by 34%. Current customers include McDonald’s, Ikea, New York Post, Audi and Kellogg's. The total addressable global advertising market is nearing $1 trillion, according to The Trade Desk’s first quarter 2025 investor presentation. In 2024, The Trade Desk delivered revenue of $2.4 billion and GAAP diluted EPS of $0.78. Analysts expect the company to double its revenue to $5.9 billion and more than quintuple its EPS to $4.42 in 2029, according to stockanalysis.com. TTD stock trades for about $71 per share, after a 26% decline over the past year. Bottom Line The AI revolution is still in its infancy, which means disciplined investments today could pay off handsomely over the next three to five years. Opt for companies using their competitive advantages to establish leadership positions in big markets. From there, be patient, but also ready to adjust your portfolio as this industry evolves.
