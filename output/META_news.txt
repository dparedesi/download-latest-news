In a recent interview with the New York Times, billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates was asked if there were types of projects that he would not invest in to offset his greenhouse gas emissions. “I don’t plant trees,” he replied, adding that planting trees to deal with the climate crisis was complete nonsense. “I mean, are we the science people, or are we the idiots? Which one do we want to be?”[1] Microsoft, the company he built his fortune on and, according to insiders, still actively advises, sees it differently. In June 2024, the tech giant bought 8 million carbon credits from the Timberland Investment Group (TIG), a fund owned by the Brazilian agribusiness lender BTG Pactual.[2] TIG is raising US$1 billion to buy and convert pasture lands to large-scale eucalyptus plantations across the Southern Cone of Latin America.[3] As these trees grow, they draw carbon from the atmosphere and store it in their roots, trunks and branches. TIG will estimate the amount of carbon removed and then sell it as carbon credits to Microsoft and other corporations. Each carbon credit that Microsoft buys from TIG is supposed to offset one tonne of the emissions Microsoft generates burning fossil fuels. This is one of the main ways that Microsoft and many other companies are planning on getting to “net zero” emissions, while still burning fossil fuels. Microsoft’s deal with TIG, reportedly the largest “carbon dioxide removal credit transaction” in history, is just one of many investments Microsoft is making in tree plantations as a way to offset its emissions.[4] The Dutch agribusiness lender Rabobank is another source of carbon credits for the tech company. It too is acquiring land in Brazil for tree plantations, in this instance with a local agribusiness family with a track record of illegal deforestation and fraud.[5] But most of the carbon credits Rabobank sells to Microsoft are from its programme to plant trees on the lands of small coffee and cacao growers in Latin America, Africa and Asia. This programme, called Acorn, uses satellites and a Microsoft digital platform to measure the number and size of shade trees that small farmers plant on their farms and then calculate the carbon they’ve removed from the atmosphere. It then sells the carbon to Microsoft as “carbon credits” for about US$38 a piece, taking a 20% cut for itself and its local partner, and paying farmers what’s left of the proceeds.[6] A big problem with Rabobank’s scheme, identified in an investigation of its project with cacao farmers in Côte d’Ivoire, is that it is vastly overestimating the carbon removed — in this case by 600%![7] What’s more, the Côte d’Ivoire government says Rabobank is likely double dipping as its project overlaps with a World Bank-funded scheme that has already generated and sold carbon credits from trees planted on small cacao farms in the same area. All of this “nonsense”, as Gates calls it, has not stopped an increasing number of corporations, governments and billionaires — not to mention a new industry of climate consultants and carbon brokers — from promoting the idea that emissions from fossil fuels can and should be offset by planting trees or other crops that sequester carbon. Such projects have a chequered history that goes back to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, but they really only took off after the 2016 Paris Climate Agreement, when governments endorsed the notion of offsets and carbon markets as an effective means to get corporations to cut their emissions.[8] Today, most offset projects are in the so-called “voluntary market”, where private companies from the global North manage the certification and sale of carbon credits to corporations that want to show they are taking action to deal with climate change. The projects, largely in the global South, can be for anything from the distribution of clean cook stoves in Malawi to the preservation of rainforests in Indonesia. The premise is that the project either prevents emissions that would have occurred without it, or that it leads to the removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Cook stoves and rainforest preservation are examples of emissions avoidance. Planting trees, on the other hand, is the most popular form of removal. In a 2024 study, the World Rainforest Movement (WRM) says that the number of tree planting projects for carbon credits has tripled over the past three years.[9] WRM says the surge is partly driven by the large number of high-profile scandals in emissions avoidance schemes, known as “REDD+”.[10] Numerous projects to preserve forests have been withdrawn or suspended from carbon markets after investigations showed they were based on implausible stories about the threat of deforestation or that they caused human rights violations and other harms to local communities. As a result, WRM says corporations are turning their attention to tree planting as a source of “high-integrity” carbon credits. This is now spawning a mad rush to secure lands where trees can be planted. Activists and scientists have been warning for years that schemes to offset carbon emissions by planting trees or other crops would lead to a surge in land grabbing, especially in the global South.[11] These warnings are now proving true. GRAIN combed through the various registries of carbon offset projects to try and get a better sense of this new land grab and how it is unfolding. We identified 279 large-scale tree and crop planting projects for carbon credits that corporations have initiated since 2016 in the global South. They cover over 9.1 million hectares of land — an area roughly the size of Portugal. (See Box 1: What’s included and what’s not included in the land deal dataset) The deals (view the dataset here) add up to a massive new form of land grabbing that will only increase conflicts and pressures over land that are still simmering from the last global land grab spree that erupted in 2007-8 in the wake of global food and financial crises. They also signify that new sources of money are now flowing into the coffers of companies specialised in taking lands from communities in the South to enrich and serve corporations, mainly in the North. Box 1: What’s included and what’s not included in the land deal dataset What’s in? Our data covers projects from all the major voluntary offset project registries. These are: American Carbon Registry (ACR), Climate Action Reserve (CAR), Gold Standard (GS), Verra (VCS), BioCarbono (BC), Cercarbono (CV) and Plan Vivo (PV). It also includes cases on the website farmlandgrab.org that are not yet found in the registries. The projects in our dataset are limited to projects that: – involve the large-scale planting of crops and/or tree species on a combined area of land over 100 ha for the purpose of producing carbon credits; – are driven by companies from outside the communities; – were initiated since 2016 and up to 31 March 2024 (roughly post-Paris Agreement); and – are located in the global South. The projects involve either 1) the creation of large-scale plantations or 2) contract production with small farmers. But all the projects bind the use of the land to the terms of the project for 20 years or more. What’s not in? REDD+ projects, which aim to avoid deforestation, are not included. Some types of projects that produce carbon credits through tree planting or agriculture on large areas of land are not included either. These are: – projects to manage pasture lands, which affect the access to lands and traditional practices of pastoralists; – projects to restore or create mangroves, where large areas of coastline are taken over for the planting of mangrove trees; and, – projects which generate carbon credits by enrolling farmers to implement agricultural practices that are said to build up carbon in the soils, often called “carbon farming”. These projects are extremely important and can have equally severe impacts on communities, including land grabbing, but they are not covered here to keep the dataset manageable.[12] Our data also does not cover projects located in the global North, such as in New Zealand, Scotland and Australia, where national schemes that endorse tree planting for carbon offsets have led to a displacement in food production and undermined farmers’ access to land.[13] To date, 52 countries in the global South have been targeted by these projects. Half the projects are in just four countries: China, India, Brazil and Colombia, which are developing their own industries of carbon project developers. But projects in these countries account for less than a third of the total land area involved. The most affected region, in terms of land area, is Africa, with projects covering over 5.2 million hectares.[14] Many of the projects involve land deals to set up giant eucalyptus, acacia or bamboo plantations. Typically, these are pasture lands or savannahs that were used until now by local communities for grazing livestock or growing food. . . The money that investors plan to capture from these deals is immense. The projects we pulled from the Verra and Gold Standard registries alone will generate 2.5 billion carbon credits (1 credit = 1 tonne of CO2 removed) over their lifetime. With an average price of about US$10 per credit, that adds up to a potential bounty of US$25 billion.[15] While these projects are exclusively set up in rural areas with extremely low emissions per capita, it is quite the opposite when it comes to the companies orchestrating the projects. With the exception of what’s happening in India and China, most carbon projects are led by foreign companies in rich countries with atrocious emissions records — such as the Netherlands, the US, Singapore, Switzerland, the UK, France, Germany and the UAE.[16] There is a clear colonial dynamic at work, with companies and big NGOs from the North once again using the lands of communities in the global South for their own agendas and their own benefit. . GRAIN and UChicago Data Science Institute (click here for better resolution) . A good number of actors driving this new wave of land grabs are in fact repeat offenders from the global farmland grab that took off a decade and a half ago. This is especially the case in Africa. (See Box 3: Africa’s land grabbers are back in business) There are also several companies from the forestry sector with histories of land grabbing and conflicts with local communities. Much of the vast eucalyptus plantations of Brazilian paper giant Suzano, for example, which is involved in three large-scale carbon plantation projects, have been grabbed from Brazil’s indigenous and traditional peoples.[17] And a non-negligible number of project developers have records of illegal dealings and financial scandal. They include: The money being hustled by these carbon cowboys comes mainly from the world’s most polluting corporations, who are interested in buying carbon credits to greenwash their emissions. At the top of the list of credit buyers are fossil fuel companies (See Box 4: Tree planting for oil pumping). But there are also tech giants like Meta and Apple, food companies like Danone and Coca-Cola, and supermarket chains like Mercado Libre and Carrefour. Amazon and the philanthropic arms of its billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, are heavily involved, too. Bezos both buys credits and funds the NGOs and companies running the plantations, through initiatives like the AFR100 fund, which aims to plant trees on 100 million hectares in Africa.[23] The same goes for development banks, like FMO of the Netherlands, the US International Development Finance Corporation or the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation, which provide cheap loans, political risk insurance and even equity investments to many carbon plantation companies. Box 2: Carbon colonialism On 15 April 2022, a group of about 150 farmers gathered outside the operations of Belgian supermarket Colruyt. Standing behind wheel barrows of soil, the farmers accused the company of “stealing lands” by buying up hundreds of hectares of the country’s scarce farmland, ironically as part of a campaign to buy local. “Each piece of land that Colruyt buys is a piece of land taken away from Belgian family farms,” they said.[24] Far away, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the supermarket chain is also acquiring land, but for decidedly not “local” reasons. In 2021, Colruyt got a 25-year, 10,656 ha concession in Kwango province — about 50 times the size of its Belgian farmlands. It plans to establish tree plantations to offset its emissions on these lands, which are currently used by local people for food crops, and to hire security guards to protect the trees from villagers and their “slash and burn” agriculture.[25] In neighbouring Uganda, the Swedish hamburger chain Max is also buying credits from a carbon plantation project, but with a different approach. Rather than displacing local farmers, it gets them to plant trees on their own lands. Participating farmers sign a contract stating that they will plant and maintain trees, get seedlings and a little training, and submit to periodic checks. In return, they get payments for the carbon credits bought by Max to offset its hamburgers. But when a team of journalists from the Swedish media site Aftonbladet visited the farmers in early 2024 they found a horror show.[26] The farmers said they had planted the trees as they were told, not knowing that these trees were offsetting a corporation’s pollution. Things started off fine, but the trees are fast growing and quickly started taking over their fields, sucking up all the sunlight, nutrients and water. The US$100 a year in payments from carbon credits did not cover the loss of food and income from their crops. Eight years into the project, the Swedish media crew found farmers starving — and some were chopping down the trees despite threats of prison for breach of contract by the project proponent. “I used to be something called a model farmer,” says Samuel Byarugaba, one of the farmers. “People came to me to learn about farming and I was proud to show our farm. We had enough food to feed ourselves and could sell the surplus. Now it’s all disappeared.” Corporations from the financial sector are also starting to get involved — a worrying sign that much more money could be mobilised. Rabobank and BTG Pactual are leading examples of financial players establishing specialised funds to invest in carbon plantations on behalf of pension funds, billionaires, sovereign wealth funds, university endowments, development banks and other institutional investors. Their investment in carbon plantations dovetails with the landholdings that many of these actors have already amassed through timber and farm land investments.[27] The Renewable Resources Group, for instance, is a US private equity firm whose investors include Goldman Sachs and the Harvard University endowment. It specialises in “monetising” water by buying up land in parts of the world where it can get access to cheap irrigation to produce high value crops for export, like grapes and berries. It has already acquired over 100,000 ha of agricultural lands in parts of Mexico, the US, Chile and Argentina where there are water scarcity issues.[28] Recently it established a “nature-based solutions” division through which it acquired the German-based private equity fund 12Tree. Since 2017, 12Tree has acquired 20,000 ha in Latin America and Africa to establish “regenerative” farms where it plants trees and generates carbon credits.[29] One big difference between earlier land grabs for food production and today’s land grab for carbon offsets is that the carbon deals are “certified”. Verra and Gold Standard, two of the top certifiers, are paid large sums of money to ensure that offset projects are done in consultation with local communities, avoid displacing them and even provide them with some benefits. It’s the kind of system that agencies like the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Bank have long claimed would solve the ills of the global farmland grab. Yet, our dataset and the growing number of investigations by academics, media and civil society into projects certified by these companies put the lie to such claims.[30] How could anyone expect that a market premised on acquiring lands from rural and indigenous communities in the global South, for the benefit of corporations in the global North, could amount to anything other than a massive land grab? No benefit-sharing mechanism, often baked into these carbon deals, alters that outcome. Box 3: Africa’s land grabbers are back in business The rush for land that followed the food and financial crises of 2007-8 hit Africa hard. Hundreds of communities were displaced from their lands to make way for large-scale industrial farms. Yet, even though many of these farms failed badly, the communities are still struggling to get back their lands.[31] Some culprits in that land rush (and near cousins) are now trying to get lands for carbon plantations. Below are some examples. Gagan Gupta: As President of agribusiness giant Olam International, this Singaporean businessman oversaw the company’s 300,000 ha land deal in Gabon in 2011 to build Africa’s largest oil palm plantation. The operation has been mired in conflicts with communities ever since. Now Gupta is running a UAE-based tree plantation company, Sequoia Plantation, which is in the process of securing 200,000 ha in Togo, Gabon and the Republic of the Congo for large-scale tree plantations with carbon offset components, despite protests from affected communities.[32] Kevin Godlington: This UK businessman orchestrated several failed large-scale land deals in Sierra Leone. One was an oil palm plantation in the District of Port Loko that cleared forest and displaced people from their lands before it went bankrupt. Undeterred, Godlington is now going after the same lands with a new venture listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange that claims to have lease rights to 57,000 ha to plant trees for carbon credits, some of which have already been bought by British Petroleum. As with the first round of land deals, no matter how things pan out, Godlington has already pocketed millions of dollars from the scheme.[33] Carter Coleman: This UK businessman built the infamous Kilombero Plantation Limited rice farm on 5,818 ha of contested community lands in the heart of Tanzania’s Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor. Despite heavy backing from foreign development banks and investors, it went bankrupt in 2019. Coleman is now back with a new company called Udzungwa Corridor Limited that will generate carbon credits by planting “rare tropical hardwoods” on a 7,500 ha stretch of land leased from local farmers along the Kilombero Nature Reserve.[34] Andrea Tozzi: This Italian businessman, CEO of his family’s company Tozzi Green, acquired 11,000 ha of land in three communes in the Ihorombe region of Madagascar in 2012 and 2018 to grow the biofuel crop jatropha. That project failed, and the company switched to growing maize for animal feed and essential oil crops. All the while the communities have been fighting to get their lands back, which they say they need to graze their cattle and grow food for their families. Tozzi is now trying to save his project by replacing the maize with plantations of acacia and eucalyptus for carbon credits — which communities, especially those in Ambatolahy, are still firmly resisting. [35] Karl Kirchmayer: This Austrian businessman, who spent years buying up 147,000 ha of farmlands in Eastern Europe, now has an African land grab venture, ASC Impact. It is partnering with a Senior Advisor to the President of Uganda and a Dubai businessman close to the royal family to sell 60 million tons of carbon credits to UAE companies from mangrove and tree plantation projects, mainly in Africa. ASC Impact is currently negotiating for 27,000 ha in Ethiopia, 25,000 in Angola and 270,000 in the Republic of the Congo! Frank Timis: This Romanian-Swiss businessman is the founder and majority shareholder of African Agriculture Holdings Inc, a US company listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange, that took over 25,000 ha of lands from a failed Italian company that local communities in Senegal have been fighting to get back for over a decade. His company is also responsible for the largest land deal in our database — a ridiculous pair of 49-year leases covering 2.2 million ha in Niger, where the company will produce carbon credits by planting pine trees. And while nine million hectares is already too much, things could get much worse. The UN climate negotiations are moving towards establishing an international carbon trading mechanism that would allow heavy polluting country governments and their companies to offset national emissions through deals for carbon projects in other countries, mainly in the global South.[36] If and when this happens, the value of carbon credits could surge, generating even higher demand for land to plant trees. Pressure is also coming from efforts to establish markets for biodiversity offsets, which will trigger a feeding frenzy among investors eager to make a buck from the territories of small farmers, indigenous peoples and pastoralists.[37] The idea that planting trees or other means of generating carbon credits can compensate for fossil fuels emissions is a dangerous distraction, incompatible with the real cuts to emissions that are required to deal with the climate crisis.[38] Consider, for instance, that even if the dubious emission removal estimates of the 279 projects in our dataset were true, they would only amount to 55 million tonnes of CO2 per year– not nearly enough to even cover last year’s 90 million tonne increase in global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels.[39] Social movements and organisations need to be relentless in exposing these contradictions, harms and frauds. We also need to get more information to the communities on the ground. They are often confused by what the project proponents tell them and not exposed about what other communities have experienced. They are almost never informed about how the projects are designed to enable big corporations to keep polluting and how this pollution is connected to the terrible impacts they are suffering from climate change. The hype about the money to be made, under the misnomer of benefit sharing, can create divisions within communities and draw some families into signing contracts they may soon regret. As all these carbon projects are premised on formal land ownership, they can also undermine community systems of land management. There are already cases where communities have faced violence and intimidation for resisting carbon offset projects and this is only going to escalate. It is therefore becoming increasingly urgent to share information and experiences about the carbon grabs – locally, nationally, regionally and internationally — so we can put a stop to them. The double threat to communities – both from climate change itself and from these criminal solutions to it — should not be allowed to play out. Box 4: Tree planting for oil pumping In September 2023, the oil company Shell shocked carbon markets when it abruptly cancelled plans to plant trees on 12 million hectares of land by 2030 – an area three times the size of its home country, the Netherlands.[40] There wasn’t much to celebrate, however, as the company also scrapped plans to reduce oil production.[41]It’s not clear if Shell was backing out entirely from the carbon offset industry, either. Shell still owns a controlling stake in a Dutch biodiesel company seeking to generate carbon credits by planting pongamia on 120,000 ha in Paraguay. Shell’s European cohorts have not yet lost their enthusiasm for carbon plantations. Italy’s Eni has a biofuel venture pursuing carbon credits in Kenya contracting farmers to grow croton plants on an initial 40,000 ha. British Petroleum (BP) paid Canada’s Carbon Done Right US$2.5 million earlier this year for carbon credits from a 57,000 ha tree plantation project the company is pursuing in Sierra Leone. And the French oil company TotalEnergies has a massive 38,000 ha acacia plantation project to offset its emissions in the Republic of the Congo. Investigations into all three projects point to severe impacts on local farmers.[42] Two of Japan’s top energy firms are also deep into carbon offset plantations. Marubeni has a 31,000 ha pine and eucalyptus plantation project in Angola with an Argentinian businessman.[43] Mitsui, through its Australian subsidiary New Forests, is erecting tree plantations for carbon credits on leased farmlands in northern Tasmania and, through its African Forestry Impact Platform, it recently acquired Green Resources AS, “a Norwegian plantation forestry and carbon credit company notorious for its history of land grabbing, human rights violations, and environmental destruction across Uganda, Mozambique, and Tanzania”.[44] * Click the share button below to email/forward this article to your friends and colleagues.

Title: What fueled this week’s record-breaking stock rally | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: The stock market is racking up record highs again. Investors are wasting no time moving into riskier assets from bitcoin to tech stocks after last week’s long-awaited rate cut from the Federal Reserve. Last week, the S&P 500 and Dow surged to new highs after the Fed said it is cutting interest rates by half a point, marking a pivot from the aggressive hiking cycle that brought rates to a 23-year high. CNN’s Fear & Greed Index, which measures seven barometers of market sentiment, is at a “greed” reading. Strong economic data this week has kept the party going. The S&P 500 on Thursday marked its 42nd record high close in 2024, while the Dow marked its 32nd record high close of the year on Friday. All three major indexes notched a positive week. The Dow gained 0.6%, the S&P 500 added 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite climbed about 1%. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, showed that the prices consumers paid for goods and services rose 2.2% last month on an annual basis, down from 2.5% in July. The reading was below expectations from economists polled by FactSet, and is a step closer towards the Fed’s 2% inflation target. Related article A dual win for consumers: Inflation cooled last month, paving way for borrowing costs to come down more Fresh data this week has offered further encouragement that the economy is on solid footing. The third estimate for second-quarter gross domestic product showed that the US economy expanded at a solid 3% clip from the prior year. “What seems to be unfolding before our eyes is a soft landing scenario that only the most optimistic could dream of,” wrote Gregory Daco, chief economist of EY, in a Thursday note. A soft landing is a scenario in which inflation comes down without the economy entering a recession. Elsewhere, the average rate on a standard, 30-year fixed mortgage fell to its lowest level since September 2022 this week, according to Freddie Mac data, providing relief for Americans stung by the tough housing market. Applications to refinance a mortgage soared 20% last week from the prior week, according to Mortgage Bankers Association data. The housing market is known for being sensitive to the ebbs and flows of the economy. Investors are now looking to the September labor report due next Friday. Employers added an estimated 142,000 jobs last month, up from July’s dismal number, while the unemployment rate ticked lower, to 4.2%, offering hope that the labor market is weakening but still on solid footing. With the Fed’s focus now squarely on keeping the labor market healthy, Friday’s report will likely offer clues for the Fed’s next move at its November policy meeting. Related article Americans are fretting over the job market Meanwhile, tech shares continued to gain this week on rate cut optimism and strong earnings from Micron. Nvidia shares jumped 4.6%, Tesla shares rose 9.3% and Meta Platforms shares added 1.1%. In China, stocks ripped higher this week after the central bank introduced a package of measures aimed at stimulating its struggling economy, including lowering interest rates. Oil prices fell for the week. The national average price of gas is about $3.21, according to GasBuddy. The Financial Times reported Thursday, citing anonymous sources, that Saudi Arabia is planning to scrap its $100 a barrel price target for oil. Gold futures retreated from a fresh record high reached Thursday, the latest in a string of records it has set this year. Gold has notched repeated record highs this year, driven by central bank buying of the yellow metal and worries about the US economy’s health. Bitcoin popped this week. The price of the cryptocurrency was last trading at about $65,747 a coin. As stocks settle after the trading session, levels might change slightly.

Title: The Secret Frameworks (Mental Models) Behind the Success of 10 Famous Entrepreneurs
URL: https://www.jeffbullas.com/mental-models/
Time Published: 2024-09-27T15:14:36Z
Full Content:
jeffbullas.com Win At Business And Life In An AI World Topics: If we put all the data we have collected in the past year from our expanding digital universe into books, we would have created 80 quadrillion books. If we stacked them (assuming a thickness of 2.5 cm), it would reach the sun 13,333 times.Or 211 light years into space. But the irony is that with all that information, we are still struggling to find wisdom. Isaac Asimov said this about the mountains of data collected by technology:“The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.” The conundrum. More information and data does not lead to better decisions. So we need to pose questions that matter: One answer is applying “mental models.” A mental model is a simplified, conceptual framework that helps us understand and interpret the world, make decisions, and solve problems. It represents how certain things work, allowing us to predict outcomes based on past experiences, knowledge, or logic. One example of a mental model is applying the compounding effect. This can be used to accumulate wealth and knowledge over a lifetime. Example 1: Compounding effect of a long term approach to investing to build “wealth“—by investing in high-quality businesses or the stock market index that consistently grow earnings, reinvesting profits over decades to create exponential wealth. This was the mental model used by Warren Buffet to make his company the 8th most valuable business in the world at $982 billion. Example 2: Compounding effect of life term learning and “knowledge.” Learning something new every day adds to your knowledge and over a lifetime it can produce enormous benefits to life and business. This is one of Bill Gates key mental models and in an information world, knowledge is wealth. Microsoft is now valued at over $3 Trillion. Mental models help us cut through complexity and distill that into simplicity. They help us make sense of all the noise that overwhelms us and allow us to focus on the key principles that govern situations. And the proof of the “mental model” approach can be found in many successful people that have used that approach—these include Richard Branson, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. If you want to see what their mental models are you can jump to the bottom of this post. Mental models can be applied to every aspect of life. The biggest decisions in life often shape our personal happiness, relationships, and long-term fulfillment. These include choosing a life partner, who you hang out with and where you have your home and how you invest your money. On the “who you hang out with,” I have a simple piece of advice:“If you want to fly like an eagle don’t hang out with turkeys.” I have told my children this many times. I hope they are listening. Here are some key decisions that we all face in life and some mental models that can help guide your thinking around them: Mental models: Mental models: Charlie Munger lived to the age of 99 and died in 2023. He, with Warren Buffet built the Berkshire Hathaway company to a valuation of $982 Billion and is the 8th most valuable company in the world after starting in 1965. He published a book titled “Poor Charlie’s Almanac” that was a distillation of all the information he had gathered over his lifetime that was instrumental in building a trillion dollar business. In it he revealed one of his secrets about how he did that. He distilled that information into wisdom using over 90 mental models, some he revealed in that book and others are still to be unearthed. In looking at his life, his mental models and his success it would suggest a strong correlation between age and experience producing wisdom. But he is not alone and there are many famous people that have developed wisdom and mental models from their life experiences to find success. Many top entrepreneurs and famous individuals utilize mental models as key tools for decision-making, problem-solving, and life optimization. Here are a few prominent figures who are known for applying mental models and the specific frameworks they employ in business and life: Sheryl Sandberg is an influential business executive, philanthropist, and as of 2023, her net worth is estimated to be around $1.6 billion, primarily derived from her stock holdings and compensation from her time at Meta, as well as her investments in other ventures. She is best known for her role as the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Facebook (now Meta), where she helped grow the platform into one of the largest social media companies in the world. Sandberg is also the author of the bestselling book Lean In, which advocates for women’s empowerment and leadership in the workplace, and founded the Lean In Foundation to support gender equality initiatives. Here are 3 of her mental models and frameworks. The most powerful mental model here for me is the framework of “taking charge” and owning your future rather than one of victimhood. That is expanded on in her best selling book “Lean In.” Warren Buffet built the Berkshire Hathaway company to a valuation of $982 Billion that is now the 8th most valuable company in the world after starting in 1965. Invest as early as possible and let compounding make you rich over time. $10,000 invested in the USA sharemarket when you were 30 becomes $237,000 when you’re 60. Going deeper In a recent AFR publication there was a chart that revealed the power of compounding returns using an example of investing in stock markets. It compared the different stock markets total return if you invested $10,000 30 years ago. It displays the power of compounding and how a small change in return can produce a much bigger result from the power of compounding. This powerful visual comparison shows that $30,000 invested in the Australian Stock market 30 years ago vs the same $30,000 invested in the USA stock over the same period. Result Total value of $10,000 over 30 years with all dividends reinvested and no withdrawals. To put that in perspective a relatively small investment of $10,000 in the USA markets when you were 30 became $237,318 at the age of 60 but only worth $135,165 in Australia. That is a $100,000+ difference The other revelation was what a difference it made when there was only a 2% difference. Australia had a 9.1% return and the USA was 11.1%. Ray Dalio is a financial success as the founder of Bridgewater which is one of the worlds largest hedge funds. And his biggest mental model is “radical transparency” within his organization. It is a model that works for him and his business. It may not work for you. But it may. A good mental model will be what makes sense to you and your experience in life. It will be the intersection of your skills, life journey and curiosity. You need to own it. Make it yours. Sometimes I find road testing different ideas is a good first step. Here are some of Ray’s mental models to reflect on. Feedback loops make a lot of sense to me.They can be seen as using information and data to find what works and what doesn’t as quickly as possible. It can be very data driven and objective or more nuanced and subjective. Jeff saw a vision of an online bookstore in 1995. 30 years later he has grown Amazon into a trillion dollar company and with a personal wealth of $211 billion dollars is the second wealthiest person in the world. He plays the long game and one of his prioritized models is long-term thinking. The regret minimization model is something worth looking deeper at. This starts to become more obvious and apparent when you’re older. And many of us live with regret.It is a great question to keep asking yourself. Maybe try putting yourself a bit further into the future and take the time to reflect on your current situation and ask better questions. Charlie Munger was Warren Buffets sidekick at Berkshire Hathaway. The reality was that he was much more than that and it was a synergistic partnership that lasted 58 years. But they both had their own mental models and agreed on others. Charlie died in 2023 and had used 90 plus mental models to help him make wise decisions. The inversion mental model is counterintuitive as it makes you look at the consequences of the opposite of what you want to achieve. Instead of focusing on what would make a project successful, you think about what could cause it to fail, and then work to avoid those pitfalls. Example: Suppose you want to improve customer satisfaction in your business. Instead of asking, “What can we do to make our customers happier?”, you ask, “What are we doing that could be making our customers unhappy?” then take specific actions to eliminate these issues, thereby indirectly improving overall customer satisfaction. I don’t need to introduce Steve Jobs except to say that his birthday on February 24 was on the same date of the year as mine. So we are both Pisces. Let’s leave the comparison there. Finding or creating “Simplicity” in the middle of all the noise and complexity takes time and effort. So…simplicity takes hard work. Winston Churchill said it well. “I would have written you a shorter letter but I didn’t have the time.” To go back to comparisons between Steve and me. I love finding the simplicity in complexity. Let me say: Less is more. The founder of Facebook (now known as Meta) has maybe created the most information in the world by getting people to sign up to his social media platform and making it easy for the world to share their information without creating any of his own. That is “scaling economics” at its smartest. Key takeaway As competitors entered the market Mark quickly realized that he didn’t have to innovate all the time but buy or copy. Instagram and WhatsApp threatened to steal traffic, users and attention from Facebook so he bought them. And to show the middle finger to Elon Musk at Twitter (Now known as X) he copied Twitter and started “Threads”. In just a few months Threads had acquired 100 million users. Innovator’s dilemma solved. Elon is currently the world’s richest person. And Tesla and SpaceX are his biggest contributors to that wealth. And he didn’t get there without some clever thinking and using some powerful mental models that helped him. Long-term vision is one of his superpowers and one of his mental models. Going to colonize Mars is as long term as it gets! It’s not in my vision as I quite like the beach and I have heard that there are no beaches and sand there. But what is interesting is that this mental model is also one of the key mental models of Warren Buffet and Jeff Bezos. No more needs to be said. Bill along with Charlie Munger and Warren Buffet spends a lot of time reading. I am not talking about superficial reading (also known as doom scrolling) on Instagram, Facebook or TikTok. As the founder of Microsoft that he started in the 1980’s (that is now worth $3.22 trillion) he has certainly earned the right to give himself the permission to read, and gain knowledge. “Compounding” is not just something reserved for financial wealth. It also applies to knowledge wealth. Taking a long term approach to gaining knowledge and hopefully wisdom is one of Bill Gates approaches and frameworks for life. Take the time to keep feeding your mind with deep knowledge and the compound effect of that will surprise you. Richard Branson had trouble reading as he was dyslexic. But that didn’t stop him succeeding as he had the ability to choose the right people to hire and partner with. I surround myself with people that do the things I hate and I am bad at. That includes cleaners, accountants and tax advisers. So realizing that you are not good at something and choosing people to help you is leaning into the mental model of “People over process” Many of these models can be adapted to our big decisions in our personal life. They can also be applied to business and investing. The challenge is that there are many mental models and that alone will produce complexity and anxiety. Your next task is to create a mental model list and distill them into which ones are relevant for you and make a shorter list. And then start applying them and testing them. Ideas without action are just noise. Share this post: © Jeff Bullas. Privacy Policy

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / SEPTEMBER 27 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO ofRelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis.

Title: Newly Reduced Quest 3 Price and Quest 3S Pre-orders Now Available on Amazon

The newly discounted Meta Quest 3 (512GB) is now available on Amazon, along with pre-orders of the new Quest 3S (128GB) and (256GB), with that sweet, speedy Prime shipping. All now include the promised bundle that includes Batman: Arkham Shadow and a three month subscription to Meta Quest+. It wasn’t initially clear exactly when the newly reduced Quest 3 price would hit—would we have to wait until Quest 3S actually launches on October 15th? Turns out, nope! The newly discounted Quest 3 (512GB) is now available on Amazon for $500. Just yesterday the headset was listing at its original price of $650. It also now includes a bundled copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow (releasing October 22nd) and a three month subscription to Meta Quest+. The Quest 3 (128GB) model is being phased out, with its own price reduced to $430 while stock remains. At the time of writing, Amazon says it’s already out of stock. But it’s currently offering an even further discounted refurbished Quest 3 (128GB) for just $380. The refurbished unit does not appear to include the Batman Arkham Shadow and Meta Quest+ bundle. As for Meta’s new Quest 3S, both models can be pre-ordered on Amazon ahead of the October 15th release date, with the (128GB) model for $300, and the (256GB) model for $400. Both include a bundled copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow (releasing October 22nd) and a three month subscription to Meta Quest+. Important note: right now the Quest 3S (128GB) is showing delivery from Amazon right around release date, but the Quest 3S (256GB) isn’t expect to deliver until the end of November. It’s unclear if this is a fluke. We’ll be keeping our eye on the date, but in the meantime it looks like ordering the (256GB) headset direct from Meta may mean an earlier delivery. Other places to check for Quest 3S stock and favorable delivery dates include Best Buy, Newegg, Walmart, and Target. Not sure if you should get Quest 3 or Quest 3S? Compare the specs and get our take right here. This article may contain affiliate links. If you click an affiliate link and buy a product we may receive a small commission which helps support the publication. More information. Meta finally getting the website-wide coverage. Glad to see no scams, over promising and under delivering, kickstarter swindels, no humble bundle sales etc on front page. I checked the 128GB Quest 3 on their site and Amazon right after the live Connect conference ended and it was out of stock already. Sounds like they're holding units back so people get the 512GB model instead, but that's just my speculation. Either way, what a lineup. 3S isn't for me (after 3's pancake lenses, I can't go back to fresnel) but it will definitely help VR in the same way Quest 2 did. What a nothingburger of a show …. ILMI remains eerily silent. No HorizonOS update. Not even any new Home enviornments. *sigh* But these reduced prices should push VR ahead nicely during the Christmas shopping season. 8^ ) 512GB is nice, but I still have more then enough room free on my Pico 4 128GB (and I'm still using it as standalone as my wifi setup and PC are still too old to do proper wireless PCVR, still use my HTC Vive Pro/wireless module for that), so 512GB is still overkill for me at the moment, maybe with the next generation it might make sense for me to buy a headset with more GB's.

JPMorgan and Jefferies analysts said Meta's (META) AI and metaverse ambitions make it a top pick after the tech giant's Connect event keynote Wednesday, where Meta unveiled several new products and AI features. The analysts said the event showcased Meta's progress in monetizing AI and made them more bullish on the stock, with JPMorgan analysts writing Thursday that they believe Meta has "earned the right to spend big on AI," given its "early AI benefits in both engagement and monetization." Jefferies analysts added that Meta's "proven ability to successfully scale & monetize new products" added to their confidence in Meta's "new AI future." JPMorgan lifted its price objective for Meta's stock to $640 from $610, while Jefferies maintained its target of $600, representing about a 5.7% to 12.7% premium above Thursday's closing price of $567.84. Both targets were higher than the analyst consensus of $587.66 compiled by Visible Alpha, though all but one of the 31 analysts surveyed held a "buy" or equivalent rating for the stock. Meta shares finished slightly lower Thursday after hitting a record intraday high earlier in the session. They've gained about 60% since the start of the year.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg seems to have stuck the landing at Meta Connect

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg needed less than an hour to wow Wall Street. He took the stage at Meta Connect in a T-shirt dedicated to himself and delivered a keynote that Wall Street seems to be responding well to. In fact, his showing was a "massive flex" for Zuckerberg, according to Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. Zuckerberg introduced a new lineup of Meta Quest headsets, some impressive AI features coming to the company's smart glasses, and gave the public a glimpse of the highly anticipated Orion holographic glasses. He even managed to sneak in one of the many memes about his stylish new look. Meta's stock jumped more than 2%, though did even out in the day following his big announcements. Over the last year or so, Zuckerberg has shown that he's not the 20-something CEO who burst onto the scene with Facebook anymore. He's turned 40, stepped up his style, and has morphed into a Meta influencer on Instagram. His confidence appears to have paid off onstage Wednesday, Stratechery founder Ben Thompson remarked. He compared Zuck's spirited keynote to that of the late Apple cofounder Steve Jobs. "I thought Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivered one of the best tech keynotes in years," Thompson wrote. That's saying something, considering 2024 has been all about the buzzy events from Big Tech. Still, Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said on X that Meta's stock fading after the keynote is likely because Orion is "years away and overall there was not much new from the event." And Thompson, who described the holographic glasses as "spectacular," gave a similar caveat. "The glasses that I tried felt like a consumer-ready product, but they reportedly cost $10,000 each, and Meta has decided to hold off on shipping a consumer version until they can bring the price down," Thompson said in a Thursday blog post. Consumers may not line up for $10,000 glasses, but reactions to Meta's vision of the future suggest they're open to a new tech frontier. A frontier that might include fewer smartphones and more chunky glasses. Jump to

Title: Where Is Amazon's Stock Price Heading In 2025?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/where-is-amazon-amzn-stock-price-heading-in-2025/
Time Published: 2024-09-26T18:50:34Z

Copyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved Where is Amazon's (AMZN) stock price heading next year? Let's formulate a prediction by running through the key factors, including the company's current position, primary growth drivers, potential challenges and strategic initiatives in play. Amazon has leading market share in two industries, e-commerce retail and cloud computing, plus a third-place share in U.S. digital advertising. Here are the numbers, according to Statista: Amazon has been a strong growth story for investors since 2010. In that period, AMZN stock grew from a split-adjusted $6 to nearly $200. The climb has not been linear, however. Shareholders benefited from a big spike in late-2020, which largely held until 2022. Like several of its tech counterparts, AMZN shed value in that year, dipping enough to walk back two years of gains. After falling to nearly $80 in December 2022, AMZN stock made a rocky climb to eclipse $200 in July of this year. Investors have since pulled back from that peak and the stock now trades at just over $190. Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions. Become a Forbes member and unlock unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts. Likely sources of growth for Amazon going forward include AWS, which will benefit from the AI boom, e-commerce sales and the rollout of advertising on Prime Video. Amazon is working to establish AWS as the first platform of choice for AI computing. That initiative involves offering customers a range of hardware and software choices at different price points. To do that, Amazon developed its own AI training and inference chips, called Trainium and Inferentia, respectively. The first generation of the in-house chips has been well-received, and Amazon expects to release updated versions later this year. As well, the company continues to enhance its software stack for AI developers. That stack includes machine-learning platforms Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock plus the generative AI coding assistant Amazon Q, among other things. On the retail side, Amazon has been working to improve delivery speed, keep prices low and expand product selection. These initiatives are gaining traction, with more customers turning to Amazon for essential goods, such as deodorant and toilet paper. This category is important because customers buy these items repeatedly. Going forward, the company is focused on reducing costs across its fulfillment network through automation and AI. Lower fulfillment costs support the three customer-oriented outcomes—faster delivery, lower costs and broader selection—that can fuel sales growth. Amazon started showing ads on Prime Video content earlier this year. The change could be an ongoing source of advertising and subscription revenue growth. The company says its ad technology can link Prime Video ad spending to sales and other outcomes, which has historically been challenging for TV advertisers. The same measurement technology can also reveal opportunities to optimize ad content for better performance. Prime subscribers can upgrade to an ad-free experience for $2.99 monthly.

Risks to watch for Amazon include rising competition in retail and cloud computing, plus a pending antitrust lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Amazon was the first to offer free shipping with a subscription, but others have followed suit. The closest Prime competitor currently is Walmart+. This program includes free shipping and delivery from Walmart stores, plus discounts on gas, entertainment and fast food. The annual price of $98 undercuts Prime's yearly rate of $139. Target also launched a paid membership product this year, called Target Circle 360. Members primarily get free two-day shipping. There are additionally many other discount online retailers that compete with Amazon, either comprehensively or in specific categories. Examples include eBay, Temu and Flipkart plus Newegg for electronics and Shein for clothes. Amazon holds the top spot in cloud computing now, but Microsoft has been moving closer. The AI boom is a strong motivation to close the gap. Building out the best cloud offering for AI computing will require continued investments in infrastructure and innovation. All three of the top providers—Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet—have deep pockets, which sets the stage for an ongoing competitive battle. In September 2023, the Federal Trade Commission and 17 state attorneys general sued Amazon for illegal, anti-competitive actions in its e-commerce business. Amazon has publicly defended its practices as being in the customer's best interest. The case could ultimately force Amazon to change its business practices or restructure. Fortunately, any damaging outcomes are likely years away, which means the process is more of a concern today than the result. If the case drags on for years, it could become an expensive distraction for Amazon. According to Amazon's second quarter 2024 earnings call, strategic priorities for next year include: Analyst predictions for Amazon characterize it as one of the best stocks to buy right now. Across 41 covering analysts, 24 rate AMZN stock a strong buy. The remaining 17 are buy ratings. There are no hold, sell or strong sell ratings. The stock currently trades at about $193 per share. Analyst price targets range from $145 to $265, with a consensus of $220.59. The midpoint represents upside of about 14%. In terms of financial results, analysts expect nearly 13% revenue growth and 66% EPS growth this year. The outlook for 2025 is about 11% revenue growth and 23% EPS growth. Amazon stock has bounced back from a tough 2022, notching roughly 60% growth over the past two years. Investors have been largely positive on AMZN in 2024, except for a dip after a disappointing jobs report in early August. The S&P 500, Amazon's tech peers and many of the best ETFs followed similar trajectories. The current stock price is about 4% below AMZN's July high point of $201.20. Amazon has momentum in AWS and retail sales, which collectively provide much of its revenue and operating income. Assuming the Fed continues to lower interest rates and the U.S. economy responds well to those changes, AMZN stock could see a double-digit lift in 2025. Additionally, several of Amazon's valuation metrics are below their five-year averages, which provides an extra margin of safety. The company's P/E ratio, for example, is 46.27. That compares favorably to the five-year average P/E of 75.63. Amazon has a pesky lawsuit in play and potentially stiff competition for cloud computing and retail sales. Even so, the tech giant has business momentum that could drive double-digit appreciation over the next 12 months. Add in reasonable valuation ratios and it's easy to argue that now may be the time to add Amazon to your portfolio. Amazon's stock price in 2025 will be affected by its success in establishing AWS as the top platform choice for AI computing. Operational execution of the Project Kuiper satellite internet project may also sway investors to trade AMZN stock. Analysts generally see more upside in Amazon's stock price than Microsoft or Apple. Nvidia and Alphabet, however, are predicted to outpace Amazon over the next year. The Federal Trade Commission has filed an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon. A quick settlement is not likely, so the suit may consume resources and be a major distraction for the e-commerce retailer and cloud provider. AWS is a key profit driver for Amazon, now and in the future. Over the last 12 months, AWS contributed 16% of Amazon's net sales and 60% of the company's operating income. Amazon is a good buy for long-term investors. The stock is volatile in the short term, but the diversification of Amazon's business model and brand recognition within multiple sectors are positives.

On Thursday, Baird, a financial services firm, updated its outlook on Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:META), increasing the price target to $605 from the previous $530. The firm has maintained an Outperform rating on the stock. The adjustment comes after Baird's review of the company's advertising performance, which showed a positive trend, particularly in September when compared to August. The analyst from Baird expressed confidence in the near-term estimates for Meta Platforms, based on the Q3 advertising checks. The firm's decision to raise the 2025 growth target for Meta is attributed to steady macroeconomic trends and anticipated contributions from messaging, devices, and AI-driven platform enhancements. These factors are expected to bolster the company's growth trajectory. Despite projecting slightly lower operating margins than the consensus due to anticipated higher networking and depreciation costs associated with infrastructure development, Baird's revised price target is based on sector multiples that align with the industry. The firm believes this new target offers a substantial upside potential for Meta Platforms. Baird's analysis indicates that while the firm anticipates increased costs in building out Meta's infrastructure, the overall outlook remains positive. This is due to the company's robust advertising checks and the expected growth from new initiatives and enhancements to the platform. In other recent news, Meta Platforms Inc. has seen a price target increase to $640 from JPMorgan, emphasizing the company's advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). Meta's AI, with substantial user engagement, is projected to become the world's most-used AI assistant by 2024. The company's significant investment in AI and the Metaverse, despite substantial projected losses, is backed by its strong operating results and early benefits of AI in user engagement and monetization. Oppenheimer maintains an Outperform rating for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., despite Meta's unveiling of its lightweight AR glasses prototype, Orion, which has not posed a significant threat to Apple's rumored Apple Vision Pro. Meanwhile, Citi maintains a Buy rating for Meta, highlighting the company's potential in AI innovation. JMP Securities has also raised its price target for Meta, lauding the company's AI-powered Orion glasses as revolutionary. Meta is also actively engaging with the European Union regarding the upcoming enforcement of the AI Act, though it has chosen not to immediately join the European Union's AI Pact. In a move towards environmental responsibility, Meta has secured up to 3.9 million carbon offset credits, marking a significant step towards achieving net-zero emissions by 2030. As Baird sets a higher price target for Meta Platforms Inc., investors might find the real-time metrics from InvestingPro to be a valuable addition to the analysis. With a substantial market capitalization of $1.44 trillion, Meta's financial health and market position are critical to understanding its potential. The company's P/E ratio stands at a competitive 28.42, indicating a reasonable valuation relative to its earnings. Moreover, the adjusted P/E ratio for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 is slightly lower at 26.66, which could signal a favorable investment opportunity when paired with the company's near-term earnings growth. InvestingPro Tips highlight Meta's perfect Piotroski Score of 9, reflecting strong financial conditions, and the fact that the company holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, providing financial flexibility. These factors, combined with Meta's impressive gross profit margins of 81.49%, underscore the company's efficiency in generating income relative to its revenue. Additionally, Meta is trading at a high Price / Book multiple of 9.17, which investors may interpret as a sign of the company's robust assets and growth potential. For those interested in further insights, InvestingPro offers additional tips, providing a comprehensive outlook on Meta's financial health and market prospects. With the next earnings date slated for October 23, 2024, market participants will be keen to see if Meta's performance aligns with Baird's positive projections and whether the company can sustain its momentum in the competitive Interactive Media & Services industry.

Title: What’s up with… Deutsche Telekom & Meta, SpaceX, AT&T

Sep 26, 2024 In today’s industry news roundup: Giant German telco accuses Meta of “twisting the facts” in the duo’s ongoing peering payments row; SpaceX is courting Vietnam, where it wants its Starlink operation to become a major broadband service provider, with talk of a $1.5bn investment; AT&T has deployed plug-and-play IT stacks to support its MVNO operations; and more! Deutsche Telekom has hit back at Meta’s decision, announced on 25 September, to end its direct peering relationship with the giant German telco, a move that might degrade the quality of service that DT’s mobile customers might experience when using popular applications, such as Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook and Messenger. Meta accused DT of “putting the open internet at risk and undermining net neutrality principles” and of “using its market power to put its subscribers in Germany behind a de facto paywall, potentially restricting their access to internet services that do not pay Deutsche Telekom” by asking Meta to pay for feeding traffic onto the telco’s networks. Now the telco has responded, saying that Meta is “once again twisting the facts,” and noting that historically Meta has paid a peering fee but stopped its payments during the Coronavirus lockdowns and is failing to renegotiate peering terms. According to DT, by ending its direct connection to the German operator, Meta is “once again abusing its overwhelming bargaining power to discredit legitimate concerns of the European telecommunications industry and consumers in order to avoid fair payment. This is not just about a difference of opinion between two companies,” it added, “but about the question of whether the power of the strongest prevails on the internet or whether there is a fair balance between all participants. We hope that this debate will not be carried out on the backs of the citizens. Even a company like Meta is not above the law.” Let’s hope this ultimately gets settled amicably and that millions of German users don’t end up suffering a degraded service. Deutsche Telekom and Meta aren’t the only ones currently engaged in a war of words. AT&T and Broadcom, which now owns US telco VMware, are locked in a legal battle over the terms of VMware’s licence agreement, as reported earlier this month. AT&T claims that Broadcom, which shifted VMware to a subscription model from its traditional perpetual licence model, is failing to honour a contract agreed with VMware before the chip giant closed its $61bn acquisition of the cloud platform vendor. Now, according to Ars Technica, Broadcom has responded with claims that AT&T has no case as it knew VMware was heading towards a subscription model before it was acquired by Broadcom, adding that the telco is resorting to “sensationalism by accusing Broadcom of using ‘bullying tactics’ and ‘price gouging’. Such attacks are intended to generate press [coverage] and distract the court from a much simpler story.” This dispute will be closely watched by many telcos and other large VMware customers, which have found themselves having to deal with a less economic cost model in recent months. Elon Musk’s SpaceX plans to invest $1.5bn in Vietnam, the satellite company’s senior VP for global business and government affairs, Tim Hughes, told Vietnam’s State President Tô Lâm during a meeting in New York this week, state-backed Viet Nam News has reported. “The Vietnamese government is weighing the investment proposal” and is “asking SpaceX to closely coordinate with relevant Vietnamese agencies and partners to complete investment procedures,” the news agency noted. SpaceX’s low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite broadband service provider, Starlink, has been seeking clearance to provide services in Vietnam and it seems clear from the report that the Vietnamese government is open to having Starlink provide data connectivity in rural and remote areas and, in doing so, help the government respond to natural disasters more effectively. Starlink is currently in negotiations about how it can provide its services while meeting Vietnam’s foreign ownership rules: The country recently liberalised its digital infrastructure ownership regulations and that has resulted in growing interest and investments in the country as a hub for datacentres – see Vietnam now a magnet for datacentre developers. AT&T has become the first US operator to achieve ‘Running on ODA’ accreditation from industry body the TM Forum. Running on ODA status is awarded to network operators that have built software stacks that conform with the forum’s open digital architecture (ODA) and open APIs, which enable a more modular, plug-and-play approach to telecom IT operations. AT&T adopted an ODA approach for the back-office operations of its MVNx Ecosystems unit, enabling mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) that use AT&T’s mobile network to reach their customers “to offer their own branded mobile services without having to invest in the expensive infrastructure typically required to operate a mobile network. ODA is a critical foundation for delivering this service, providing a common framework on which AT&T’s customers can innovate and offer new experiences by integrating network capabilities into their products and services,” noted the TM Forum in this announcement. “I’m delighted that AT&T has further demonstrated its commitment to ODA and open API standards by gaining Running on ODA accreditation for its MVNx Ecosystems group,” noted Andy Tiller, EVP of member products and services at the TM Forum. “By embracing ODA, AT&T is making it easier and faster for its partners to build and launch new services, leveraging the power of AT&T’s network. This means more innovative offerings and greater choice for consumers,” added Tiller. For more on ODA see DT, Orange et al join the ‘running on ODA’ club. Not for the first time, large language model (LLM) developer OpenAI, best known for its Chat GPT generative AI (GenAI) application, has suffered a top management meltdown. The company nearly imploded late last year when CEO Sam Altman was sacked, appeared to be hired by OpenAI investor Microsoft, and was then reinstated as head honcho of OpenAI. Now, just as the company is in discussions for a fresh round of funding – reportedly $6.5bn at a valuation of $150bn – OpenAI’s influential CTO, Mira Murati, quit suddenly on Wednesday, announcing her departure via a post on X. Murati was not alone – VP of research Barret Zoph and chief research officer Bob McGrew also quit the company which, according to Reuters, might be shifting from ‘not-for-profit’ governance to a ‘for-profit’ model. The trio’s departure marks something of an ongoing brain drain at OpenAI: In August, co-founder John Schulman joined rival AI firm Anthropic, and another co-founder, Greg Brockman, announced he was taking a sabbatical until the end of 2024. Earlier in the year, another co-founder, chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, left the company. As you might expect, seasoned industry analyst Richard Windsor is not impressed with recent development at OpenAI: “How this [company] is worth $150bn is beyond me,” he noted in his latest Radio Free Mobile blog. Orange’s decision to delist from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and voluntarily deregister with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), announced on Wednesday, is simply a matter of reducing the telco’s administrative workload, a spokesperson for the telco told Reuters after the announcement resulted in a dip in the company’s share price on the Paris stock exchange. Orange noted in its official announcement about the decision that the move “is in line with the group’s aim to improve internal simplification and efficiency, while maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance and transparent financial reporting. Orange remains fully committed to an open and frequent dialogue with US investors. This decision is expected to have no impact on Orange’s clients and partners or its commercial presence in the US.” Ericsson and optical networking module developer Nubis Communications used this week’s ECOC trade show, held in Frankfurt, to propose the use of co-packaged optics in future radio access network (RAN) architectures. “Co-packaged optics can enable high capacity at low energy consumption in future RAN networks, but dedicated developments are needed,” noted Ericsson in this blog. “In a demo at ECOC 2024, Ericsson and Nubis showcased the ability to operate at high temperatures commonly found within radio units, compatibility with standard optical fibres, and implementation of automated eye-safety mechanisms. This can be very beneficial in the networks of the future, including 6G,” stated the vendor, pointing out that such technology is not currently used in RAN deployments as pluggable optics are currently meeting network operators’ needs. However, data traffic growth will put a strain on pluggables, the partners suggested. To find out more about the case for co-packaged optics in the RAN, check out this blog. – The staff, TelecomTV Sep 27, 2024 Sep 26, 2024 Sep 25, 2024 Sep 25, 2024 Sep 25, 2024 Sign up to receive TelecomTV's top news and videos, plus exclusive subscriber-only content direct to your inbox.

Title: A risk-averse sustainable perishable food supply chain considering production and delivery times with real-world application
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308332
Time Published: 2024-09-26T14:00:00Z

In recent years, a relatively novel paradigm known as sustainable development has been introduced in response to concerns regarding the adverse impact of industrial activities on the environment and society. Managers in the food sector have been attempting to incorporate the principle of sustainable development in their supply chains owing to the paramount importance of social and environmental considerations in creating a competitive advantage for food products. To this end, we propose a multi-objective linear mathematical model considering the three dimensions of sustainability, i.e. economic, environmental, and social, to design a sustainable food supply chain. Given today’s volatile business environment, we employ a robust optimization model by incorporating Conditional Value-at-Risk into the configuration of two-stage stochastic programming to tackle uncertainty and take up a risk-averse strategy in supply chain design. The model aims to identify the optimal production and delivery times of the products, investigate the effects of their perishability characteristic on inventory decisions, and assess the financial and environmental advantages of transportation decisions to improve the sustainability of logistics operations. A novel version of fuzzy goal programming approach is applied to solve the proposed model. Next, the applicability of the proposed model and its solution method is verified based on computational experiments on a real-world case study of a processed food company. Lastly, conflicts between the sustainability aspects are examined, and several sensitivity analyses on risk-aversion parameters are performed to provide managerial insights for industry executives seeking to optimize their network concerning sustainability issues and well-performance under worst-case scenarios.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. A supply chain (SC) is a set of processes and flows that take place within and between different network components, including all parties directly or indirectly involved in fulfilling customers’ demands. The food supply chain (FSC) is perceived as critical infrastructure as it ensures the wellbeing and food security of customers and yields profit for the firms involved [1]. According to projections, the global food demand is expected to rise by 50% by 2030 [2]. The food industry has experienced enormous challenges in recent decades. The COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, has caused a worldwide spike in food demand over the last four years. Consequently, optimal decisions and efficient SC management are needed to respond to the continuously growing food demand [3]. Researchers and practitioners often classify SC decisions according to the length of the planning horizon into three categories: strategic, tactical, and operational [4]. Supply chain network design (SCND) comprises a set of crucial strategic decisions that determine the number, location, and capacity of facilities as well as the flow between them [5]. Through its influence on tactical and operational decisions, SCND significantly affects product quality, service level, material flow, customer satisfaction, and return on investment [6]. Typically, SCND in the food industry involves a high level of complexity due to the unique characteristics of foodstuff, such as perishability [7, 8]. Unlike many types of commodities, the demand for food is directly affected by the age and freshness of the products. Hence, failure to provide customers with high-quality, fresh food products often leads to a decrease in demand and thereby a dramatic decline in profitability [9]. Therefore, the perishable nature of food products imposes additional costs on the SC and requires continuous monitoring and replenishment of inventory levels in facilities to keep the inventory fresh and consumable [10]. Sustainability is among the significant issues to consider in the network design of FSCs. A SC is considered sustainable when the SC management policies and innovations of the organization are aligned with the principles of sustainable development. Achieving sustainable development requires balance between economic growth, environmental protection, and social welfare [11]. Sustainable Development Goals are a set of interconnected objectives proposed by the United Nations that call for emphasis on developing sustainable FSCs and effecting fundamental changes to improve the current food systems by 2030 [12]. The World Health Organization reports that FSCs release a significant amount of pollutants which are responsible for an estimated 20 to 30 percent of all environmental impacts [13]. Also, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), over one-third of all food produced annually is wasted. So, food waste is the biggest threat to global food security, and reducing food waste is essential to achieving global food security and sustainable development [14]. On the other hand, risk management in the field of SCND has drawn increasing interest among scholars and industry practitioners [15]. There is a high degree of interdependence between network nodes in any type of SC. Therefore, the risks generated in one node often spread quickly to others and negatively impact their operational and sustainability performance [16]. The occurrence of risks is widely believed to reduce the profitability and efficiency of the SC. In the case of FSCs, risks may also accelerate the products’ deterioration rate, adversely affecting the environment and the firm’s reputation [17]. In this regard, effective risk management is essential to ensure sustainable operations [18]. SC risk refers to potential losses in terms of the objectives resulting from uncertainties in the features of the SC that can arise when a triggering event occurs [19]. In general, two types of risks can be associated with SCND problems: disruption risks and operational risks [20]. Disruption risks, including natural disasters (e.g. floods, earthquakes, and storms), human-made crises (e.g. wars and terrorist attacks), and technological malfunctions (e.g. equipment failure), can significantly undermine the performance of SCs. Operational risks, on the other hand, arise due to uncertainties in parameters such as supply, demand, transportation costs, etc. in dynamic business environments. To be precise, this type of risk is caused by the deviation of stochastic parameters from their expected values, leads to potential financial losses, and hampers the company’s efforts to meet its objectives [21, 22]. The risk-averse approach was developed to cope with uncertain parameters and guide managers when making decisions under uncertain conditions [23]. When addressing FSC problems, it is important to consider the above-mentioned concerns simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is among the first attempts to investigate a comprehensive risk-averse sustainable FSC design problem. In this regard, we model the risk aversion approach using the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), a well-known risk measure to tackle random outcomes, volatility, and the inherent uncertainties of SCs. The proposed multi-period multi-objective programming model considers the perishability of food products based on the production and delivery times of the products and their shelf-life. Also, by addressing three objective functions, the economic, environmental, and social pillars of sustainable development are taken into consideration. We use preemptive fuzzy goal programming (PFGP), a novel multi-objective method, to solve the model. Lastly, we test the applicability of the mathematical model through computational experiments conducted on a numerical example and provide a number of managerial insights into some of the model’s critical parameters. The primary contributions, and novelty of this research can be summarized as follows: The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the literature review of the subject. Section 3 describes the problem and its mathematical formulation. Section 4 presents the solution approach of the proposed model. Section 4 is devoted to the real-world case study, computational results and sensitivity analyses on some crucial parameters. Section 5 discuses some managerial insights and practical implications. Eventually, Section 6 provides conclusions and suggestions for future research. In this section, we review the relevant prior research from three different perspectives: (1) food supply chain network design (FSCND) problems, (2) sustainable SCND problems, and (3) risk-averse SCND problems involving risk measures and uncertainty. For the works reviewed in each subsection, we provide a brief summary and then mention the contributions of our study in that regard. Finally, at the end of this section, the details of the relevant prior research and the proposed study are summarized in Table 1 to clarify research gaps. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t001 Due to the growing importance of food, there has been an increasing number of studies on the subject of FSCND in recent years. Mohammed and Wang [24] proposed a multi-objective model to design and plan a meat SC. The researchers used three different methods to solve the multi-objective model and, in the end, opted to use the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to obtain the optimal solution from the Pareto frontier. Mohammed et al. [25] expanded the aforementioned approach by presenting a multi-objective model that used stochastic programming to deal with uncertainty. The authors employed the monitoring system known as Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) to satisfy the objectives of their model. Mohammed and Wang [26] presented another mathematical model to improve the distribution system of their earlier meat SC model. Aras and Bilge [27] presented a mixed-integer linear programming model to design a FSC in Turkey. The authors utilized the minimax regret approach to deal with uncertain demand. Mohebalizadehgashti et al. [28] formulated a meat SC with the objective of minimizing the total cost and CO2 emission, as well as maximizing the capacity utilization rate of the facilities in the network. Patidar and Agrawal [29] introduced a mixed-integer non-linear programming formulation to optimize the total cost of an agricultural SC. The results indicated that the expenses incurred by farm-to-market transportation were responsible for 85% of the total SC cost. To mitigate this defect, they proposed that the farmers be classified into clusters such that their crops would be aggregated in cluster centers and transported to the market from there. Gholami-Zanjani et al. [30] developed a two-stage scenario-based model with uncertain demand and disruptions caused by an epidemic. The researchers incorporated a number of resilience strategies into the core model to design a resilient FSC. Arabsheybani and Arshadi Khasmeh [31] proposed a robust bi-objective model to design a resilient FSC with the objectives being to maximize the total profit and total resilience score. Relying on four criteria to enhance the resilience of the SC (robustness, agility, leanness, and flexibility). Gholami-Zanjani et al. [13] developed a new framework to configure a resilient green meat SC. The authors implemented two resilience strategies to hedge the network against disruptions and solved the model by applying the sample average approximation and lexicographic weighted Tchebycheff methods. The concept of sustainability has gained popularity in the last few years since it demonstrates that a SC’s competitive advantages cannot only be achieved through optimizing its economic aspects [32]. Sustainability is more emphasized in some industries, such as the food industry, due to the specific characteristics of their products. In this subsection, we survey some of the studies on sustainable SCND problems. Allaoui et al. [2] came up with a hybrid two-stage methodology to optimize a sustainable SC in which sustainable suppliers are selected using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Yakavenka et al. [33] presented a distribution network design problem for perishable food products considering the three dimensions of sustainability. The proposed model’s objectives were to minimize the total cost, total emission of transportation modes, and transportation times. Mohammadi et al. [34] developed a sustainable multi-objective model for a processed food company. The decisions made by proposed model included facility location, aggregating the flow of materials between facilities, and selecting the type of product delivery (either directly from plants or indirectly from distribution centers). Jouzdani and Govindan [35] introduced a non-linear mathematical model to design a sustainable perishable FSC. In this study, the perishability of the products followed the Weibull distribution and was affected by the use of vehicle refrigerator. Goodarzian et al. [36] formulated a bi-objective mixed-integer non-linear programming model to design a citrus fruit supply chain network. The contribution of this paper is the development of a mathematical model for designing a three-echelon network that takes into account coefficient water, CO2 emissions, and time window concurrently. Kalantari and Hosseininezhad [12] developed a sustainable model considering four risk factors: delays, fluctuation of exchange rates, quality of raw materials and production. The authors used the cross-entropy method to solve the model for large instances using the optimization software GAMS. Momenitabar et al. [37] introduced a sustainable closed-loop supply chain network that minimizes total and environmental costs, including energy consumption and pollution emissions, and maximizes employment opportunities. To reduce the environmental impacts, the circular economy concept has been addressed in this study. Momenitabar et al. [38] developed a mathematical model for designing a sustainable bioethanol supply chain network. In order to determine the best method to predict the actual amount of demand, they compared three popular machine-learning methods. In addition, the authors considered two meta-heuristic algorithms to find pareto optimum solutions for the large-scale problem. Goodarzian et al. [39] investigated a novel multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model to establish a sustainable citrus closed-loop supply chain network. The authors included the circularity strategy and the triple bottom lines of sustainability into their model. Mohammadi et al. [40] presented a mixed-integer non-linear programming model to design a sustainable FSC for perishable products. To show the validity of proposed model, they conducted several sensitivity analyses on crucial parameters and applied the model in a food company. Lastly, Momenitabar et al. [41] integrated machine-learning algorithms with quantitative optimization modeling to design a sustainable bioethanol supply chain. In this work, three machine-learning approaches have been applied to forecast the bioethanol demand as model inputs. A few studies have considered risk-aversion in SCND and their mathematical models, some of which are presented in this subsection. Noyan [42] used two-stage stochastic programming (TSSP) to design a disaster management SC under disruption and operational risks. In order to address the variability of non-deterministic parameters, the author incorporated the CVaR measure into the stochastic programming framework. Ahmadi-Javid and Seddighi [43] developed a location-routing optimization model under disruption risks to design a SC consisting of manufacturers and distributors in which a single type of commodity is distributed to several consumers. The problem was formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming model under three risk measurement policies: optimistic, cautious, and pessimistic. The authors utilized the expectation, CVaR, and worst-case risk measures to calculate the risk under each policy. Soleimani and Govindan [44] used a risk-averse TSSP method to plan and design a reverse SC in which the CVaR was used to evaluate the risk associated with the uncertainty in prices and demand for returned products. Govindan and Fattahi [45] proposed a multi-period optimization model under demand uncertainty with the goal of minimizing the total SC cost. The problem was formulated by incorporating TSSP and the CVaR into the model to address risk-aversion. Rahimi and Ghezavati [46] developed a mixed-integer linear programming model to design and plan a sustainable reverse logistics network under uncertainty. The authors applied a risk-averse TSSP approach, utilized the CVaR to cope with the deviation of demand and investment rate from their expected values, and solved a numerical example to obtain potential managerial insights. Rahimi et al. [47] investigated risk-averse SCND by proposing a mixed-integer non-linear programming model to configure a sustainable SC in which the CVaR risk measure was assimilated into the model. This paper contributes mainly by offering various discount policies for selling products to customers. Lotfi et al. [48] developed a model to design an antifragile, sustainable, and agile network that integrates these concepts taking into account several factors such as resilience, risk, robustness, and environmental issues. The authors incorporated the Entropic Value at Risk (EVaR) measure into the stochastic programming framework to address risk-aversion. The cost function of this model encompasses the expected value, maximum, and EVaR. Lotfi et al. [49] proposed a novel hybrid method of robust optimization which employs a stochastic approach to address uncertainty and risk management. The objective function of the model given involves maximizing the coefficients of mean and minimum profits under multiple scenarios, while considering an energy-aware constraint. Lotfi et al. [50] introduced a novel viable SC in which robust stochastic optimization is combined with CVaR as risk criteria to ensure an optimal approach. The objective function of their model minimizes the expected value, maximum, and CVaR of cost. Lotfi et al. [51] presented a new data-driven robust optimization in viable supply chain network design by utilizing Open Innovation (OI) and Blockchain Technology (BCT). The authors employed a robust stochastic optimization technique and assimilated the CVaR measure into the model to effectively tackle uncertainty as well as risks. As our review of the literature reveals, several studies have investigated sustainable FSCND, but no comprehensive study has been conducted on risk-averse SCND while developing a sustainable FSC at the same time. To address this gap, we present a sustainable risk-averse FSC by incorporating the CVaR into our model to develop a robust network in an uncertain environment. Moreover, a few papers have considered the specific characteristics of food products, such as perishability, in their proposed FSCs (e.g. [13, 30, 34]). Therefore, we also incorporate perishability and its implications into our model by considering the shelf-life of foodstuff to prevent the decay of finished products along the SC. We discovered that making inventory and transportation decisions based on integration of production and delivery times may bridge a significant gap in the literature on FSCND. Furthermore, in the majority of the research papers on sustainability, the only instance of social impact addressed by the authors appeared to be job creation, and other factors such as safety had been largely neglected. Our research methodology outlining the steps undertaken is summarized by the flowchart presented as Fig 1, acting as a guide for the research process. In light of the gap analysis presented in this subsection, and based on Table 1, the present study may contribute to the literature in the following ways: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g001 In this study, we develop a risk-averse sustainable FSC considering the perishability of the food products. The proposed SC is multi-echelon, multi-period, and multi-product, and consists of raw material suppliers, manufacturers, distribution centers (DCs), and retailers with uncertain demand. The process of material flow begins by purchasing raw materials from the suppliers. Next, the products are manufactured in the factories and shipped to the retailers through the DCs by transportation modes. Fig 2 graphically illustrates the structure of the proposed FSC. To design the aforementioned network, a two-stage multi-objective programming model is presented. In this model, the three dimensions of sustainability are introduced in the form of three objective functions. In the first objective, the economic dimension of sustainability is addressed by minimizing the total costs of the network composed of the first stage costs, second stage costs, and CVaR costs. The environmental dimension of sustainability is the second objective function which minimizes the total environmental effects of the network. Total environmental effects of the SCN are comprised of carbon released by establishing facilities, production, handling processes and transportation. Lastly, social dimension of sustainability is considered in the third objective which represents the social aspect of the SC and aims at maximizing the total social effects of the network, which includes of created job opportunities and worker’s lost days multiplied to their given weight.

In this type of framework, decisions are made over two sequential stages. In the first stage, decision-makers should make scenario-independent decisions that typically determine the number, location, and capacity of facilities. Scenario-independent decisions are made before the realization of uncertain parameters (e.g. demand, supply, transportation costs, etc.) and generate the first-stage (a.k.a. design stage) costs. In the second stage, scenario-dependent decisions (e.g. material flow, inventory level, production rate, etc.) are made regarding the second stage (a.k.a. planning stage) costs after the values of uncertain parameters have been realized [52]. Eq (1) gives the first objective function, i.e. economic sustainability, which aims to minimize total cost of the SC, consisting of first-stage, second-stage, and CVaR costs. The components of Eq (1) are formulated as follows: (2) (3) (4) Eq (2) obtains the fixed costs of establishing manufacturers and DCs. Eq (3) calculates the second-stage costs, consisting of the costs of purchasing raw materials, production, distribution, inventory holding in manufacturers and DCs, transportation, and lost demand in retailers, with respect to the set of scenarios. The last component of Eq (1) relates to the costs of the CVaR, which is defined as Eq (4) [22]. Eq (5) states the second objective which represents environmental sustainability and minimizes the total environmental impacts of the proposed SC, comprising the carbon emitted in the processes of establishing the facilities, production, handling, and transportation of the products. The terms of Eq (5) are presented as follows: (6) (7) (8) (9) Eq (6) computes the amount of carbon emitted in the process of establishing the manufacturers and DCs. Eqs (7) and (8) compute the environmental impacts of production and handling processes in the manufacturers and DCs, respectively. Eq (9) determines the amount of carbon emitted from the transportation of products. The first term of Eq (9) states the environmental impacts of transporting raw materials from suppliers to manufacturers, while the second term represents the environmental impacts of transporting the finished products from manufacturers to DCs. The last term of Eq (9) calculates the environmental impacts of transporting the products from DCs to retailers. Eq (10) concerns social sustainability and aims to maximize the total social impacts of the proposed SC which consists of the number of job opportunities created and workers’ lost days multiplied by their weight. The components of Eq (10) are defined as follows: (11) (12) The first component of Eq (10) states the number of jobs created by establishing manufacturers and DCs, presented as Eq (11). The second component, calculated by Eq (12), pertains to the number of lost days caused by work-related damages during the process of establishing manufacturers and DCs. Eqs (13) and (14) ensure that each manufacturer and DC can be established only at one capacity level. Eq (15) indicates the amount of raw material purchased from suppliers. Due to the fact that food products are inherently perishable, inventory management and transportation decisions between network nodes require applying more constraints compared to other products. Therefore, in this paper, by considering the shelf life, production and delivery times of products individually, we intend to prevent the perishability of products along the network. In fact, the level of products inventory and the amount of products flow between network nodes are associated with the optimal production and delivery times as well as shelf life of the products. To address this issue, Eqs (16) to (29) have been defined in the proposed model. Eqs (16) to (18) calculate the inventory level of products according to their shelf-life for each manufacturer at different periods. Eqs (16) and (17) show the level of on-hand inventory at time periods shorter than the shelf-life of the product. However it is worth mentioning that in the first period, no inventory is added from the previous period. Therefore, the inventory levels of the products in each manufacturer for t = 1 < slp and 1 < t < slp are calculated separately using Eqs (16) and (17), respectively. Eq (18) computes the inventory level at time periods longer than the shelf-life of the product. Eqs (19) and (20) compute the flow of each product from a manufacturer to a DC considering its production period. As mentioned in Eqs (16) to (18), the product flows between the relevant nodes are formulated differently for t < slp and t ≥ slp. Eqs (21) and (22) present the inventory balance of products in each manufacturer based on their production period. Similar to Eqs (16) to (18), the inventory levels of products in the DCs for different intervals of t are calculated by Eqs (23) to (25). Eqs (26) and (27) define the flow of each product from a DC to a retailer based on its production time. Eqs (28) and (29) determine the inventory levels of DCs based on their delivery periods. Eq (28) indicates when the delivery period is equal to the time period, the inventory level of DCs is equal to the quantity of products delivered from manufacturers to DCs subtracted by the flow of products to retailers. Eq (29) states that when t − e < slp, the current inventory level is equal to the inventory level of the previous period subtracted by the flow of products to the retailers. Eq (30) determines the quantity of products shipped to retailers as well as the quantity of shortage. Eq (31) defines the raw material procurement capacity of suppliers. Eq (32) presents the production capacity of each manufacturer at each time period. Eqs (34) and (35) express the maximum throughput capacity of each manufacturer and DC, respectively. Eqs (35) to (37) show the capacity constraint of the transportation modes. Eqs (38) to (40) state the decision variables whose values should be zero. Eq (41) calculates the deviational value that exceeds the value-at-risk. Finally, Eqs (42) and (43) express the types of the decision variables. In the process of solving real-world problems, there is often more than one objective function, each offering a specific solution if optimized separately. Such circumstances require that a trade-off be established among the objective functions and multi-objective optimization approaches were originally conceived precisely to solve such problems. One of the most commonly-used optimization approaches, introduced by Charnes et al. [53], is known as goal programming. In this approach, decision-makers define an expectation level for each objective function as its goal and try to minimize the deviation from these expectation levels [54]. Ostensibly, decision-makers should accurately determine the expectation level of each objective; however, in reality, the uncertainty of the available information makes it nearly impossible to assign perfectly accurate levels to the objectives. Fuzzy sets theory, introduced by Zadeh [55], is regarded as an effective approach to decision-making under uncertainty. Arikan and Güngör [56] then combined fuzzy set theory and goal programming to create the fuzzy goal programming (FGP) approach. Recently, a novel extension of FGP, known as preemptive fuzzy goal programming (PFGP), was proposed by. The model was developed with different priorities and had the advantage of largely eliminating the limitations of the original approach. One such limitation was that decision-makers were required to set a precise lower bound for the satisfaction degree of the objectives. Moreover, it was often the case that in order to achieve the minimum satisfaction degree for one of the objectives, a better total satisfaction degree for all objectives had to be eliminated. The new model identified and mitigated this issue, accepting solutions that have a higher satisfaction degree while taking into account the priority of the objectives in question. In this approach, the goals are prioritized and the satisfaction degree of the first priority should be greater than the others. By adding certain equations to constraints that illustrate the importance of each goal, this priority structure is taken into account. PFGP is applicable to multi-objective problems that involve uncertainty and objectives with different importance degrees [57]. In the present study, we adopt the PFGP method as it eliminates the requirement that a fixed value be determined for both the objective function and the satisfaction degree. It also takes uncertainty into account when determining the goal of each objective. Using this method, decision-makers can easily adjust the priority of the objective functions and observe the results of the optimal solution [58]. The notations of PFGP are as follows (Table 3): https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t003 Using the notations presented above, the mathematical model based on PFGP can be expressed as follows: (44) s.t. Eq (44) expresses the goal of the PFGP approach which is maximizing the total satisfaction degree. In Eq (45), hc(X) represents the constraints of the main model. Eqs (46) and (47) determine the satisfaction degrees of the goals for minimization objectives, where ∀i = (1, 2,…, ii) is the set of minimization objectives. Eqs (48) and (49) calculate the satisfaction degrees of the goals for maximization objectives, where ∀i = (ii + 1,…, i) is the set of maximization objectives. Eq (50) relates to the priority of the goals, stating that the most important objective should achieve a satisfaction degree greater than or equal to the other objectives. Finally, Eq (51) defines the type of the decision variables of the PFGP model. In this section, we introduce the case study used in this research and the input data of its parameters. The problem is then solved using PFGP, and the analysis results are presented at the end. Due to the constantly evolving lifestyles of consumers, the processed food industry plays a significant role in providing the population’s needs by producing and distributing a variety of products, also appearing to be on a growing trajectory. In this study, we investigate a processed food company as a real-life case study to measure the effectiveness of our model. The manufacturing plant is located in Tehran province, Iran, and the products are sold on domestic and international markets. The manufacturer procures its required raw materials, mainly chicken and beef, from multiple suppliers. In the proposed model, we consider only two types of finished products: hamburger 80% beef, and sausage 70% chicken. Because of their perishability, the products are transported by refrigerated trucks. The network size of the case study detailed in Table 4. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t004 In this study, we focus on three three modes of transportation: light truck, medium truck, and heavy truck. The data used in the present research on the capacities of transportation modes and the quantities of CO2 emissions have been retrieved from Mohammed et al. [25] and Nayeri et al. [59] (see Table 5). Three levels of capacity: low, medium, and high, with different costs, carbon emissions, and job opportunities have been considered for establishing facilities in potential locations. Tables 6 and 7 show the values of the parameters related to each manufacturer and DC with different capacity levels. Also, we examine three prominent demand scenarios for each retailer in our case study: the most pessimistic, the most probable, and the most optimistic. Numerous studies in the literature on SCND problems have repeatedly implemented the same three demand levels to generate their scenarios and have subsequently attested to the reliability and efficiency of the method (e.g. [22, 60, 61]). According to the historical data obtained from the case study as well as the experts interviewed for the purposes of this paper, the occurrence probability of scenarios are estimated at 0.25, 0.5, and 0.25, respectively. Tables 8 to 11 detail the costs of the model, including the fixed cost of establishing facilities, operational cost, raw material purchasing cost, and holding cost of finished products. Since the finished products discussed in this study have different raw material consumption rates, weights, shelf-lives, and production processes, the production capacity and costs associated with each type of product vary, as well (see Table 12). In addition, Table 13 provides the data on the corresponding values of each retailer’s demand under each scenario. The environmental parameters are presented in Tables 14 to 16. We have gathered the data on environmental parameters from several sources, including the food carbon footprint calculator, an online platform provided by MyEmissions.green, and also from academic articles (e.g. [62]). The values of the social parameters can be found in Tables 17 and 18. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t005 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t006 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t007 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t008 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t009 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t010 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t011 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t012 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t013 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t014 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t015 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t016 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t017 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t018 The proposed mathematical model is solved by the optimization software GAMS using the case study parameters. Furthermore, λ1 > λ2 > λ3 is the fuzzy satisfaction degree reflecting the importance degrees of the objective functions according to the experts’ opinions. Table 19 details the output generated from solving the model. In addition, the numerical results of some analyses performed on the model are presented in the following subsections. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t019 The majority of stochastic programming models addressing food supply chain (FSC) under uncertainty are usually designed to be risk-neutral. In this paper, a risk-averse two-stage stochastic programming is aiming to trade off the expected total cost and risk cost, based on a predetermined level of responsive risk aversion employing CvaR as a coherent risk measure. The purpose of this subsection is to compare the main risk-averse problem (considering CvaR) and risk-neutral problem (without considering CvaR). The comparison of the economic objective function of the proposed model between risk-averse and risk-neutral problems is illustrated in Fig 3. As can be seen, the value of economic objective function in risk-averse problem is 8.65% more than risk-neutral one. Since it overcomes the variability of the uncertain parameters, provides more robust solutions compared to a risk-neutral problem in presence of uncertainty, and assist decision makers when faced decisions with uncertain outcomes. It is worth noting that decision-makers can achieve higher levels of risk aversion by increasing the value of network costs, which will cause the model to behave more conservatively and generate better solutions in worst-case scenarios. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g003 In this subsection, we intend to examine the service level of the SC in terms of lost demands. In the long run, unmet demands can result in customer dissatisfaction which, in turn, could negatively affect the firm’s reputation. Consequently, we can conclude that the more the level of service provided by the SC, the less lost demand will occur. In simple terms, lost demand is a consequence of increasing the total cost with the purpose of establishing balance between economic, social, and environmental sustainability. Table 20 details our analysis of the total value and percentage of lost demands for finished products under each scenario. The finished products in each scenario have varying amounts of unfulfilled demands in which the abovementioned reason is mainly responsible for them. Another noteworthy point inferred from the table is that when the demand for the finished products rises by 50% in the in probable scenario, the quantities of lost demand for the two products increase by 32.1% and 35.7%, respectively. It may thus be concluded that insufficient production capacity is the most likely culprit for the resulting unmet demand. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t020 This section is dedicated to sensitivity analyses on the sustainability dimensions. For this purpose, we solve the proposed model in three different types: economic, green, and sustainable, and then proceed to discuss the results. In the economic type, only the economic objective function is addressed in the model; in the green type, both the economic and environmental objective functions are addressed simultaneously; and in the sustainable type, the problem is solved by considering the economic, environmental, and social objective functions, i.e. all three dimensions of sustainability. According to Table 21 and Fig 4, solving the problem in the economic type leads to the economic and environmental objective functions to take their best and worst values, respectively. However, focusing solely the economic dimension obtains the best value for the economic objective function. In the green type, by adding an environmental dimension to the problem, the opposite of the results of the economic type is obtained. That is, the economic and environmental objective functions take their worst and best values within the specified cases, respectively. Based on this observation, we may conclude that the green type increases the value of the economic objective in order to ensure a better value for the environmental objective. In the sustainable type, in order to establish a balance between the three dimensions of sustainability, economic and environmental objectives both gain values that lie between the values they were assigned in the economic and environmental types. Moreover, Table 19 indicates that the sustainable type results in a 9% increase in the total cost, as well as a 28.3% decrease in the environmental impacts, and a 53.6% increase in the social impacts compared to the economic type. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g004 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t021 In the PFGP approach, the influential factor is the priority of objective functions, which is defined by their fuzzy satisfaction degrees (λi). Therefore, we solve the model in six cases to assess the impact of changes in the objective functions’ priority on the problem. Table 20 shows the results of solving the model in the presented cases. Based on Table 20 and Fig 5, the conflicts between the economic and environmental goals are evident. In case 1, when the economic objective function takes the highest priority, it is assigned the best value, while the environmental objective function is assigned the worst. In Case 2, in which the priority of the second objective function is higher than the other two, the environmental impact is given the best value, with the economic objective function getting the worst. In case 3, where both the environmental and economic objectives are equally important, the value of both objective functions is squarely between their worst and best values. Table 22 and Fig 6 illustrate the conflict between the economic and social objective functions. In case 4, when the economic objective has the highest priority, it is assigned the best possible value. Conversely, the social objective function receives the worst value among all the cases. Based on case 5, when the social objective function becomes the top priority, it gets the best value, while the economic objective function has the worst value. Finally, in Case 6, in which the social and economic objectives share the top priority, the value of both objective functions is between their lowest and highest. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g005 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g006 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t022 In this section, we assess the risk-aversion parameter in order to clarify how it may affect the objective functions of the proposed model and the obtained solutions. Consider an experiment with four different β values where the value of θ = 0.5 remains fixed to better comprehend how β impacts the model. Table 23 and Fig 7 show that as β grows larger, the value of the economic objective function increases, as well. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g007 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.t023 Since CVaR measures the mean value of the worst (1 − β) % of the total expected cost, when the value of β increases, the risk aversion behavior of the proposed model improves. Hence, the model behaves more conservatively and the CVaR concentrates on the greater realization of total cost. Total costs are comprised of the first-stage costs, CVaR costs, and second-stage costs. It is also important to note that, the first- stage costs and consequently the number of established facilities do not change in response to varying risk parameters since they are not a function of CVaR. In other words, CVaR costs affect the second-stage costs. In general, we may draw the conclusion that a high risk-aversion strategy would result in higher levels of the second-stage costs and the total costs. To better comprehend this mechanism, we need to examine how β influences the environmental and social objective functions. As previously mentioned, by raising the value of β and giving the model a risk-averse attitude, the value of the economic objective function increases and the model should become more conservative, resulting in an upward trend in the value of the environmental impact and a downward trend in social impacts. This conflict can be clearly observed in Table 23 and Fig 8. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g008 To examine the impact of changes in demand on the value of the objective functions, we solve the model in five demand modes: -30%, -15%, 0%, +15%, and +30%). The results of the sensitivity analyses are shown in Fig 9. As expected, rising demand values increase the total SC costs. This may be a consequence of establishing new high-capacity facilities, increased raw material procurement and production of finished products, as well as transportation between the network nodes to satisfy the demand. Furthermore, as more high-capacity facilities are activated and transportation between facilities is raised, which leads to the use of higher capacity transportation modes, the adverse environmental impacts of the network increase. In addition, as the demand grows, the model tends to create more jobs by establishing more facilities and activating higher capacity levels to meet the retailers’ demand. In case of a significant increase in demand, the proposed model tries to keep the total SC costs at a minimum by not establishing new facilities. This is because the costs of opening new facilities to fully meet the demand outweigh the costs incurred by lost demands. Therefore, the model prefers to avoid establishing new facilities, activates lower capacity levels, and only partially satisfies the demand. This results in a less steep upward trend in total cost and social impact. As Fig 9 indicates, the reaction of the economic, environmental, and social objective functions in the proposed model to changes in demand under different modes complies with the above-mentioned explanations, indicating the proper logic of the model. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g009 Taking into account the current situation of the case study, which consists of one medium-capacity manufacturer and two high-capacity DCs, the values of the economic, environmental, and social objective functions are 1999168 × 107, 79453400, and 529.2, respectively. In accordance with the opinions of the case study experts, the potential locations for construction of new facilities were selected based on the company’s revision plans regarding its supply chain to gain a larger market share. The results of solving the proposed model for the economic, environmental, and social objective functions are 1952306 × 107, 75179800, and 491.4, respectively. Fig 10 compares the proposed and current conditions of the case study and displays the values of the model’s objective functions. As can be observed, compared to the current situation, the model proposed in this research causes a 2.3% drop in costs, a 5.4% drop in adverse environmental impacts, and a 7.1% drop in social impacts. This is achieved by constructing a medium-capacity manufacturers along with one medium-capacity and two low-capacity DCs. Thus, it can be said that the proposed model, whose candidate locations for the company’s future plans were selected by the experts, improves the current situation in terms of costs and environmental impacts. In addition, considering the high priority of the total SC costs, the downward trend of the social objective function in favor of the economic objective function seems logical. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0308332.g010 In this study, we developed a sustainable risk-averse model to design a SC for processed food products under uncertain conditions. To this end, a multi-period multi-objective model was presented to make decisions on facility location, optimal sourcing, transportation mode selection, capacity planning, and inventory management. The resulting model addresses three dimensions of sustainability as economic, environmental, and social objective functions, thereby minimizing the total cost and carbon emissions and maximizing the number of job opportunities created and safety of the FSC. The main contribution of this research to the literature may lie in our decision to incorporate a risk measure into the design of a sustainable FSC; an innovation that has never been attempted by previous researchers. Furthermore, we applied a scenario-based TSSP approach to cope with the uncertainty of demand for finished products and utilized a novel PFGP multi-objective method to solve the mathematical model. Also, we compared our proposed model with a situation in which the CvaR risk measure was not taken into account. Finally, results show that the value of cost function in risk-averse problem is 8.65% more than risk-neutral one. Because it behaves more conservatively and offers more resilient solutions in the presence of uncertainty compared to a risk-neutral problem. Practitioners and academics can achieve significant outcomes by solving real-world case studies aligned with distinctive industry characteristics. Selecting the processed food industry in Iran and optimizing FSC, which contributes to all dimensions of sustainability, can be beneficial for food industry executives. Several useful managerial insights can be drawn from the analysis of the numerical results, including the following: This research advances the field of FSC by addressing perishability in inventory decisions based on the production and delivery times of the products. A scenario-based TSSP approach that incorporates CvaR as a risk criteria into the objective function is employed to ensure a robust network in an uncertain environment. Finally, investigating a real case study in processed food industry, several strategic decisions including facility location, supplier selection, capacity planning, and transportation mode selection are made in the proposed FSCN. Based on sensitivity analyses on crucial parameters, findings of our research are as follows: The limitations of the research are obtaining optimal solutions on a large scale and within an acceptable timeframe. To address this issue, we recommend applying exact and evolutionary algorithms in combination with novel heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms, such as those put forward by [63–65]. Finally, the authors would like to recommend the following as potentially promising subjects for further investigation. It is possible to experiment with different quality levels for raw materials and suppliers can place various purchase discounts based on the quality and quantity of the raw materials required by manufacturers. Additionally, exploring global SC issues and factors may be a highly relevant research route, as most leading SCs in various sectors operate globally today. Furthermore, incorporating other risk criteria, such as Entropic VaR (EVaR) and Robust CvaR (RCVaR) may provide significant benefits for conservative decision-makers as future research, aiming to enhance the robustness of the model’s performance and enable it to effectively handle fluctuations [66]. Utilizing alternative methods, like stochastic, fuzzy, and robust optimization techniques that incorporate data-driven uncertain parameters can offer risk-averse decision-makers a more accurate representation of the situation, enabling them to make optimum decisions while reducing risks [64, 66, 67].

Wall Street is looking at a higher open Thursday, led by surging tech stocks after memory chipmaker Micron delivered a better-than-expected quarter and upside guide. Micron shares jumped 18%. China stocks rallied again — this time on signs the Chinese government is prepared to add fiscal stimulus to this week's central bank monetary stimulus. The commentary out of China supported global markets. 2. Micron said high bandwidth memory sold out for calendar year 2024 and 2025. Personal computers set to have a better second half of 2025 as artificial intelligence PCs gain momentum. Micron's smartphone unit growth expected to continue in 2025. Jim Cramer said on X: "If you bought Micron off of our suggestion from our [Mad Money] Gameplan last Friday I would not sell it. That was some forecast for every business in 2025. It also affirms AMD and NVDA outlooks." Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices are Club stocks. 3. Starbucks was upgraded to an outperform buy rating at Bernstein. Even after the stock's 27% move since Brian Niccol was named CEO, the analysts think the valuation of the Club stock "does not fully appreciate the earnings power that Starbucks could unlock." Starbucks also was getting a bump on the fiscal stimulus commitment from the Chinese government. 4. GE Healthcare was downgraded to sell at UBS on concerns about rising competition from Chinese competitors. The analysts' pessimism seems overblown. The company has a strong relationship in China and has been manufacturing there for 30 years. Health-care stimulus packages in China have been slow to roll out, and that's weighed on the Club-owned maker of MRI machines. Here's our screen on China exposure for all of our 32 portfolio stocks. 5. Bank of America raised its Meta Platforms to $630 per share from $563, representing 10% upside to Wednesday's close. JPMorgan took its PT on Meta to $640. The fresh bullish commentary followed the wearable showcase at the company's Connect 2024 product and developer conference. CEO Mark Zuckerberg brought out prototype AR glasses that received rave reviews, including a stamp of approval from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. 6. Southwest Airlines upped its third quarter forecast and announced a $2.5 billion share repurchase program and other changes at its investor day on Thursday. The carrier is making the moves as it battles activist investor group Elliott Management. 7. Truist started First Solar and power play GE Vernova with buy ratings. For the Club, our solar and renewable play is Nextracker, whose technology makes sure solar panels are always facing the sun. We also own Eaton as a way to benefit from the growing complexity of energy infrastructure in the age of AI. 8. Jefferies Financial dropped on a quarterly profit and revenue miss. The results provided an early look into investment banking and capital markets activity before the big banks, including Club names Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley, report in a couple of weeks. Jefferies said IB was strong and capital markets were only down a bit compared to tough comps. 9. JPMorgan raised its DraftKings price target to $54 per share from $48 and kept its overweight buy rating. The analysts said positive comments at online betting and iGaming platform Flutter Entertainment's Capital Markets Day is good news for DraftKings. Flutter is FanDuel's parent company. 10. Hershey was downgraded to an underperform sell by Jefferies research analysts on chocolate snacking concerns. The analysts said that "everyday chocolate is being bought less frequently, especially by low-income consumers," because prices are so high. — Sign up for Jim Cramer's Top 10 Morning Thoughts on the Market email newsletter for free (See here for a full list of the stocks at Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

September 26, 2024 08:30 ET | Source: Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC September 26, 2024 Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC (“Biodexa” or the “Company”) Interim results for the six months ended June 30, 2024 Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC (Nasdaq: BDRX), an acquisition-focused clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of innovative products for the treatment of diseases with unmet medical needs, today announces its unaudited interim results for the six months ended June 30, 2024 which will also be made available on the Company’s website at www.biodexapharma.com OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS The Company announced the following in the six months ended June 30, 2024: Post period end: FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Post period end: Commenting, Stephen Stamp, CEO and CFO, said “It was a busy first half for Biodexa. Licensing in eRapa, a Phase 3 ready asset with access to $17 million of non-dilutive grant funding, is an enormous step forward. The second half will be about executing on our lead programs. We already have approval from Health Canada for the IIT Phase 2a study of tolimidone in Type 1 diabetes and we are working diligently to set up a global Phase 3 registrational study of eRapa in FAP so we can begin recruiting early next year.” For more information, please contact: Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC Stephen Stamp, CEO, CFO Tel: +44 (0)29 2048 0180 www.biodexapharma.com About Biodexa Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC (listed on NASDAQ: BDRX) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of innovative products for the treatment of diseases with unmet medical needs. The Company’s lead development programs include eRapa, under development for Familial Adenomatous Polyposis and Non-Muscle Invasive Blader Cancer; tolimidone, under development for the treatment of type 1 diabetes; and MTX110, which is being studied in aggressive rare/orphan brain cancer indications. eRapa is a proprietary oral formulation of rapamycin, also known as sirolimus. Rapamycin is an mTOR (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin) inhibitor. mTOR has been shown to have a significant role in the signalling pathway that regulates cellular metabolism, growth and proliferation and is activated during tumorgenesis. Tolimidone is an orally delivered, potent and selective activator of Lyn kinase. Lyn is a member of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases, which is mainly expressed in hematopoietic cells, in neural tissues, liver, and adipose tissue. Tolimidone demonstrates glycemic control via insulin sensitization in animal models of diabetes and has the potential to become a first in class blood glucose modulating agent. MTX110 is a solubilised formulation of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, panobinostat. This proprietary formulation enables delivery of the product via convection-enhanced delivery (CED) at chemotherapeutic doses directly to the site of the tumor, by-passing the blood-brain barrier and potentially avoiding systemic toxicity. Biodexa is supported by three proprietary drug delivery technologies focused on improving the bio-delivery and bio-distribution of medicines. Biodexa’s headquarters and R&D facility is in Cardiff, UK. For more information visit www.biodexapharma.com.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW Our primary focus in the first half of 2024 was on assimilating tolimidone, licensed in December 2023, into our portfolio and searching for additional clinical-stage assets to diversify and advance our pipeline which ultimately led to the licensing of eRapa in May 2024. eRapa License In line with our strategy to build a sustainable therapeutics company in rare/orphan diseases, we continue to search for opportunities to broaden and diversify our development pipeline. On April 25, 2024, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement (“LCA”) with Rapamycin Holdings, Inc. (d/b/a Emtora Biosciences), relating to the license of eRapa, an oral formulation of rapamycin (also known as sirolimus) for use in all diseases, states or conditions in humans. Under the LCA, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable right to develop, manufacture, commercialize, or otherwise exploit products containing rapamycin. Pursuant to the terms of the LCA, the Company and Emtora established a joint development committee to monitor and progress the development of eRapa. Emtora has conducted a Phase 1 study of eRapa in prostate cancer, a Phase 2 study in FAP and has an ongoing Phase 2 study in Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer. Preparations are under way for a registrational Phase 3 study of eRapa in FAP. In consideration for the license, we made an upfront payment of 378,163 ADSs (equal to five percent of our then outstanding Ordinary Shares, calculated on a fully-diluted basis). In addition, we are also responsible for up to an aggregate $31.5 million in sales milestones within the first six months of commercial sale of a first-approved indication of eRapa in certain markets with decreasing milestones for subsequent approvals for additional indications. There is also a one-time $10.0 million milestone payable upon cumulative net sales of $1.0 billion. Further, we are also obligated to pay Emtora single digit tiered royalties on net sales of eRapa, in addition to honouring Emtora’s legacy royalty obligations and paying Emtora fees related to income derived from sublicensing and partnering of eRapa. In addition, a promissory note previously issued by Emtora in favour of the Company in the amount of $0.25 million was forgiven. We also made an additional $0.5 million payment which was used for a match to an advance from the CPRIT. Emtora had secured a grant of $17.0 million from CPRIT to support the Phase 3 study of eRapa in FAP. The grant requires a 1 for 2 match and Biodexa was expected to fund the match of up to $7.5 million, being 50% of the remaining CPRIT grant, which was completed in September 2024. Grant funding is available once the match payment has been certified and CPRIT has approved eligible trial expenses. In certain instances, CPRIT may advance payments before eligible trial expenses have been incurred. Upon a change of control of the Company, we will issue Emtora a warrant exercisable for 1,604,328 ADSs. The LCA also provides us with the exclusive option to acquire all of the capital stock of Emtora on commercially reasonable terms in the 90 days after acceptance of the filing of an NDA by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). R&D update Following the in-licensing of eRapa, our development pipeline has not only advanced in terms of clinical stage but expanded to six programmes overall, four of which are orphan indications: eRapa eRapa is a proprietary oral formulation of rapamycin, also known as sirolimus. Rapamycin is an mTOR (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin) inhibitor. mTOR has been shown to have a significant role in the signalling pathway that regulates cellular metabolism, growth and proliferation and is activated during tumorgenesis1. Rapamycin is approved in the US for organ rejection in renal transplantation as Rapamune®(Pfizer). Through the use of nanotechnology and pH sensitive polymers, eRapa is designed to address the poor bioavailability, variable pharmacokinetics and toxicity generally associated with the currently available forms of rapamycin. eRapa is protected by a number of issued patents which extend through 2035, with other pending applications potentially providing further protection beyond 2035. Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (“FAP”) FAP is an orphan indication characterized by a proliferation of polyps in the colon and/or rectum, usually occurring in mid-teens. There is no approved therapeutic option for treating FAP patients, for whom active surveillance and surgical resection of the colon and/or rectum remain the standard of care. If untreated, FAP typically leads to cancer of the colon and/or rectum. There is a significant hereditary component to FAP with a reported incidence of one in 5,000 to 10,000 in the US1 and one in 11,300 to 37,600 in Europe2. eRapa has received Orphan Designation in the US with plans to seek such designation in Europe. Importantly, mTOR has been shown to be over-expressed in FAP polyps – thereby underscoring the rationale for using a potent and safe mTOR inhibitor like eRapa to treat FAP. An open-label Phase 2 study (NCT04230499) was conducted by Emtora in seven U.S. centres of excellence in 30 adult patients. Patients were sequentially enrolled into three dosing cohorts of 10 patients each for a 12-month treatment period: 0.5mg every other day (Cohort 1), 0.5mg daily every other week (Cohort 2), and 0.5mg daily (Cohort 3). Upper and lower endoscopic surveillance occurred at baseline and after six months. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability of eRapa and percentage change from baseline in polyp burden, as measured by the aggregate of all polyp diameters. In May 2024, results of the Phase 2 study at six months were presented at the prestigious 2024 Digestive Disease Week annual meeting in Washington D.C. by Carol Burke, MD, the Principal Investigator. In summary, at six months, eRapa appeared safe and well-tolerated with a significant 24% reduction in the total polyp burden at six months compared with baseline (p=0.04) and an overall 83% non-progression rate. In June 2024, results of the Phase 2 study at 12 months were presented at the bi-annual InSIGHT meeting in Barcelona by Dr Burke. Overall, 21 of 28 (75%) patients were deemed to be non-progressors at 12 months with a median reduction in polyp burden of 17%. In Cohort 2, the likely dosage regimen for Phase 3, eight of nine (89)% of patients were deemed non-progressors at 12 months with a median reduction in polyp burden of 29%. Over the course of 12 months, there were four related Grade 3 or higher and one related Serious Adverse Event reported during the trial and 95% compliance rate at 12 months. One patient was removed from the trial due to non-compliance. The Phase 3 registrational study is planned to be a double-blind placebo-controlled design recruiting approximately 150 high risk patients diagnosed with germline or phenotypic FAP. The primary clinical endpoint is expected to be the first progression free survival event which will comprise composite endpoints including major surgery. A ‘Type C’ meeting with the FDA is planned for 4Q24 to finalise the protocol and related matters. A $17 million grant from CPRIT will support this study. Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (“NMIBC”) NMIBC refers to tumors found in the tissue that lines the inner surface of the bladder. The most common treatment is transurethral resection of the bladder tumor followed by intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (“BCG”) with chemotherapy depending upon assessment of risk of recurrence. NMIBC is the fourth most common cancer in men with an incidence of 10.1 per 100,000 and 2.5 per 100,000 in women3. Our ongoing multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study in NMIBC is expected to enrol up to 166 patients with primary endpoints of safety/tolerability and relapse free survival after 12 months of treatment. The Phase 2 study, which is supported by a $3.0 million non-dilutive grant from the National Cancer Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, is expected to read out in mid-2025. MTD228 – Tolimidone Tolimidone was originally discovered by Pfizer and was developed through Phase 2 for the treatment of gastric ulcers. Pfizer undertook a broad pre-clinical program to characterize the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, metabolism and toxicology of tolimidone. Pfizer discontinued development of the drug due to lack of efficacy for that indication in a Phase II clinical trial. Tolimidone is a selective activator of the enzyme Lyn kinase which increases phosphorylation of insulin substrate-1, thereby amplifying the signalling cascade initiated by the binding of insulin to its receptor. Type 1 Diabetes (“T1D”) Tolimidone’s potential utility in T1D has been demonstrated by several ground-breaking preclinical studies conducted by the University of Alberta, where Lyn kinase was identified as a key factor for beta cell survival and proliferation in in vitro and in vivo models. Most importantly, tolimidone was able to induce proliferation in beta cells isolated from human cadavers. From a mechanism of action perspective, tolimidone has been shown to both prevent beta cell degradation and to stimulate beta cell proliferation. In a meta analysis of 1,202 articles and 193 studies, the incidence of T1D was shown to be 15 per 100,000 with a prevalence of 9.5 per 10,000 of the population4. As a first step in the continued clinical development of tolimidone, a Phase 2a Investigator Initiated Trial (IIT) at the University of Alberta Diabetes Institute is designed to establish the minimum effective dose of tolimidone in patients with T1D. The study, which was approved by Health Canada in July 2024 is expected to recruit 12 patients initially across three dose groups. The study will measure C-peptide levels (a marker for insulin) and HbA1c (a marker for blood glucose) after three months compared with baseline and the number of hyperglycemic events. MTX110 MTX110 is a solubilised formulation of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, panobinostat. This proprietary formulation enables delivery of the product via convection-enhanced delivery (CED) at chemotherapeutic doses directly to the site of the brain tumor, by-passing the blood-brain barrier and potentially avoiding systemic toxicity. All three types of brain cancer being studied are orphan. Recurrent Glioblastoma (“rGBM”) Our Phase 1 MAGIC-G1 study (NCT05324501) of MTX110 in rGBM completed the dose escalation part of the study with the recruitment of the fourth patient in Cohort A. In February 2024 we announced Patient #1, who had received sub-optimal infusions of 60µM of MTX110 had survived for12 months from the start of treatment (OS=12). GBM universally recurs and once it does median overall survival according to a retrospective analysis of 299 patients reported in the Journal of Neuro-Oncology is 6.5 months. Post period end, we provided an update on the status of cohort A in the MAGIC-G1 study: patients #1 and #2 have deceased with overall survival (OS) since start of treatment of 12 months and 13 months, respectively. Patients #3 and #4 remain alive with progression free survival (PFS) since the start of treatment of 6 and 9 months, respectively and OS thus far of 12 and 11 months respectively. GBM virtually always recurs with median Progression Free Survival of 1.5–6.0 months and median Overall Survival of 2.0–9.0 months5. Diffuse Midline Glioma (“DMG”) In February 2024 we announced headline data from a Phase 1 IIT study conducted by Columbia University in newly diagnosed patients with DMG. As this was the first ever study of repeated infusions to the pons via an implanted CED catheter, the primary objective of the study was safety and tolerability and, accordingly, the number of infusions was limited to two, each of 48 hours, 7 days apart in nine patients. One patient suffered a severe adverse event assessed by the investigators as not related to the study drug. Although not powered to reliably demonstrate efficacy, median overall survival (OS) of patients in the study was 16.5 months compared with median survival rate in a cohort of 316 cases of 10.0 months (Jansen et al, 2015. Neuro-Oncology 17(1):160-166). Study investigators subsequently presented the results of the trial at the 21st International Symposium on Pediatric Neuro-Oncology (ISPNO 2024) in Philadelphia. Medulloblastoma An IIT Phase I study of MTX110 in medulloblastoma remains ongoing at the University of Texas. Financing As a pre-revenue biotech company, securing adequate finance to fund operations to an out-licensing and/or partnering event is a constant focus. On the back of the eRapa in-licensing and the subsequent announcement of positive 6-month and 12-month data of eRapa in FAP, we accomplished two financings; the first in May 2024 and the second post period end in July 2024. May 2024 Warrant Exercises On May 22, 2024, we raised $6.05 million of gross proceeds from the exercise of previously issued warrants following an agreement between the Company and several accredited investors to exercise existing Series E warrants and Series F warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 4,358,322 ADSs. The warrant holders agreed to exercise the Series E and/or Series F warrants at an exercise price of $1.50 (reduced from $2.20) per ADS. In consideration for the immediate exercise of the Series E and/or Series F warrants for cash, we issued one replacement warrant for each Series E warrant exercised in the form of a Series G warrant, and one replacement warrant for each Series F warrant exercised in the form of a Series H warrant. The Series G and Series H warrants are exercisable for five years and one year, respectively, at $2.50 each. July 2024 Registered Direct Offering and Private Placement On July 22, 2024, we utilised our capacity under our Registration Statement on Form F-3 to raise $5.0 million in gross proceeds in a Registered Direct Offering with certain institutional investors for the sale of an aggregate of 5,050,808 ADSs and 278,975 pre-funded warrants at a price of $0.94 per ADS. In a concurrent Private Placement, we issued and sold to the Investors (i) Series J warrants exercisable for 5,329,783 ADSs, and (ii) Series K Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 5,329,783 ADSs. The Series J and Series K warrants are exercisable for five years and one year, respectively, at $1.00 per ADS each. 1. https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/familial-adenomatous-polyposis/ 2. https://www.orpha.net/en/disease/detail/733#:~:text=FAP%20has%20a%20birth%20incidence,colorectal%20cancer%20(CRC)%20cases. 3.

Birzu et al. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7794906 1H24 FINANCIAL REVIEW The unaudited results for the six months ended June 30, 2024 are discussed below: Key performance indicators (KPIs): Biodexa’s KPIs focus on the key areas of operating results, R&D spend and cash management. These measures provide information on the core R&D operations. Additional financial and non-financial KPIs may be adopted in due course. Revenues Total revenue for the six months to June 30, 2024 was £Nil compared to £0.30 million in the first six months of 2023. The R&D collaboration with Janssen, which represented the entire revenue in 1H23, concluded in September 2023. Research and Development R&D costs in 1H24 reduced by £0.06 million, or 3%, to £2.19 million compared with £2.25 million in 1H23. The percentage of R&D costs as a percentage of total operating costs increased to 52% in the period from 50%. The reduction in R&D costs in 1H24 reflects a reduction in spend of £0.54 million on the MAGIC-G1 study in rGBM, the termination of legacy drug delivery projects and lower personnel costs offset by the addition of MTD228 (tolimidone) and MTX230 (eRapa) for a combined expenditure of £0.65 million in 1H24. Administrative Costs Administrative costs in 1H24 decreased by £0.26 million, or 11% to £2.03 million from £2.29 million in 1H23. The decrease in administrative costs in 1H24 is a result of a positive reversal in foreign exchange of £0.23 million and a reduction in professional fees of £0.14 million offset by increases in share-based payment charge of £0.12 million and sundry other costs. Finance Income and Expense Finance income in 1H24 and 1H23 included gains in respect of an equity settled derivative financial liability of £0.75 million (1H23: £0.39 million). The gains arose as a result of the fall in the Biodexa share price. In addition, the Company earned interest on cash deposits. Finance expense in the period related to lease liabilities and discounted interest on deferred consideration. Cash Flows Cash outflows from operating activities in 1H24 were £4.81 million compared to £3.88 million in 1H23, driven by a net loss of £3.31 million (1H23: £3.57 million) and after negative working capital of £0.87 million (1H23: positive £0.21 million) and other negative non-cash items totalling £0.63 million (1H23: negative £0.52 million). Net cash used in investing activities in 1H24 of £0.75 million in 1H24 resulted from the purchase of eRapa licence for total consideration of £3.07 million including cash consideration of £0.85 million (1H23: £Nil) offset by £0.10 million of interest received (1H23: £0.02 million). Net cash generated in financing activities in 1H24 was £4.65 million (1H23: inflow £6.25 million), which was driven by receipts from share issuances, including warrants, net of costs of £4.74 million offset by payments on lease liabilities of £0.09 million. Overall, cash decreased by £0.92 million in 1H24 compared to an increase of £2.39 million in 1H23. This resulted in a cash balance at June 30, 2024 of £5.06 million compared with £5.23 million at June 30, 2023 and £5.97 million at December 31, 2023. Going concern Biodexa has experienced net losses and significant cash outflows from cash used in operating activities over the past years as it develops its portfolio. For the six months to June 30, 2024, the Group incurred a consolidated loss from operations of £3.31 million (1H23: £3.57 million) and negative cash flows from operating activities of £4.81 million (1H23: £3.88 million). As of June 30, 2024, the Group had accumulated deficit of £147.88 million. The Group’s future viability is dependent on its ability to raise cash from financing activities to finance its development plans until commercialisation, generate cash from operating activities and to successfully obtain regulatory approval to allow marketing of its development products. The Group’s failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on its financial condition and ability to pursue its business strategies. The Group's consolidated interim financial information has been presented on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As at June 30, 2024, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of £5.06 million. The Directors forecast that the Group currently has enough cash to fund its planned operations into the first quarter of 2025. If the Company does not secure additional funding before the first quarter of 2025, it will no longer be a going concern and would likely be placed in Administration. The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts and considered the cash flow requirement for the Group for the next three years including the period 12 months from the date of approval of this interim financial information. These forecasts show that further financing will be required before the first quarter of 2025 assuming, inter alia, that certain development programs and other operating activities continue as currently planned. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or additional equity securities, it could result in dilution to our existing shareholders, increased fixed payment obligations and these securities may have rights senior to those of our ordinary shares (including the ADSs) and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects. On August 27, 2024, the Company received notification from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC advising that the Company was not in compliance with the minimum bid requirement set forth in NASDAQ’s rules for continued listing of its securities. The Company has requested a Hearing Panel which has paused any suspension or delisting action pending the hearing. If the Company's ADSs are delisted, it could be more difficult to buy or sell the Company's ADSs or to obtain accurate quotations, and the price of the Company's ADSs could suffer a material decline. Delisting may impair the Company's ability to raise capital. In the Directors’ opinion, the environment for financing of small and micro-cap biotech companies continues to be challenging. While this may present acquisition and/or merger opportunities with other companies with limited or no access to financing, as noted above, any attendant financings by Biodexa are likely to be dilutive. The Directors continue to evaluate financing options, including those connected to acquisitions and/or mergers, potentially available to the Group. Any alternatives considered are contingent upon the agreement of counterparties and accordingly, there can be no assurance that any of alternative courses of action to finance the Group would be successful. This requirement for additional financing in the short term represents a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt upon the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. Should it become evident in the future that there are no realistic financing options available to the Group which are actionable before its cash resources run out then the Group will no longer be a going concern. In such circumstances, we would no longer be able to prepare financial statements under paragraph 25 of IAS 1. Instead, the financial statements would be prepared on a liquidation basis and assets would be stated at net realizable value and all liabilities would be accelerated to current liabilities. The Directors believe there are adequate options and time available to secure additional financing for the Group and after considering the uncertainties, the Directors consider it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements. Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of clinical trials. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. If we lack sufficient capital to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Going Concern – material uncertainty Biodexa has experienced net losses and significant cash outflows from cash used in operating activities over the past years as it develops its portfolio.

The LCA entered into with Emtora meets the definition of a Joint Arrangement under IFRS 11, specifically related to the FAP program. A jointly controlled escrow account was established on completion of the LCA. All FAP program transactions are processed through the escrow account, including the Company’s deposits of matching funds, as set out in the agreement, the receipt of grant funding from CPRIT and the payment of eligible R&D expenses. Although the CPRIT grant and R&D supplier contracts are with Emtora, the joint arrangement nature of the LCA results in Emtora being deemed to be acting as the Company’s agent. Accordingly, the Company recognises 100% of the grant and 100% of the R&D expenditure. The CPRIT grant recognised is on a 1 for 2 match. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policy, the grant, as it is the re-imbursement of directly related costs, is credited to R&D costs in the same period in The Statements of Comprehensive Income. The escrow account is recognised within prepayments, CPRIT grant received in advance is recognised within deferred revenue and any grant not yet received is recognised in accrued income. In 1H24 the company recognised R&D costs of £0.2 million on the FAP project, this was made up of expenditure of £0.5 million netted against CPRIT grant of £0.3 million. The balances as at June 30, 2024 were as follows in relation to the FAP project: Prepayments £1.2 million Deferred revenue £0.1 million The gain on the equity settled derivative financial liability in 1H24 and 1H23 arose as a result of the fall in the Biodexa share price. Income tax is recognised or provided at amounts expected to be recovered or to be paid using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the Group Statement of Financial Position date. Research and development tax credits are recognised on an accruals basis and are included as an income tax credit under current assets. The research and development tax credit recognised is based on management’s estimate of the expected tax claim for the period and is recorded within taxation under the Small and Medium-sized Enterprise Scheme. Basic loss per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net loss for the period from continuing operations, attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent company, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. As the Group made a loss for the period the diluted loss per share is equal to the basic loss per share. The Company has considered the guidance set out in IAS 33 in calculating the denominator in connection with the issuance of Pre-Funded, Abeyance Shares, Series A, Series B and Series C warrants as disclosed in note 8. Management have recognised the warrants from the date of grant rather than the date of issue of the corresponding Ordinary Shares when calculating the denominator. The Group has made a loss in the current and previous periods presented, and therefore the options and warrants are anti-dilutive. As a result, diluted earnings per share is presented on the same basis as basic earnings per share. The individual intangible assets which are material to the financial statements are as follows: *asset is not yet in use and has not started amortising On April 25, 2024 the Company entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement (LCA) with Rapamycin Holdings, Inc. (d/b/a Emtora Biosciences), relating to the license of eRapa. In consideration for the License, the Company made an upfront payment of 378,163 ADSs (equal to five percent of our then outstanding Ordinary Shares, calculated on a fully-diluted basis). In addition, a promissory note previously issued by Emtora in favor of the Company in the amount of $0.25 million was forgiven and certain historical liabilities relating to their on-going FAP and NMIBC programs were settled. The Company is also obligated to make quarterly payments to Emtora of $0.25 million less 75% of any research sales by Emtora until the handover trigger event occurs. The obligation meets the definition of a financial liability in accordance with IAS32 and is measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS9. Management have estimated the expected liability to be $3.1 million and the present value as $2.5 million. In addition, the Company is also responsible for up to $31.5 million in sales milestones within the first six months of commercial sale of a first-approved indication of eRapa in certain markets, with decreasing milestones for subsequent approvals for additional indications. There is also a one-time $10.0 million milestone payable upon cumulative net sales of $1.0 billion. Further, the Company is also obligated to pay Emtora single digit tiered royalties on net sales of eRapa, in addition to honouring Emtora’s legacy royalty obligations and paying Emtora fees related to income derived from sublicensing and partnering of eRapa. The LCA also provides the Company with the exclusive option to acquire all of the capital stock of Emtora on commercially reasonable terms in the 90 days after acceptance of the filing of an NDA by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). If the Company does not exercise the option, it would be required to make additional quarterly payments, as disclosed in note 7, until the first commercial sale of the product. The Company is obligated to make quarterly payments to Emtora of $0.25 million less 75% of any research sales by Emtora until the handover trigger event occurs. The obligation meets the definition of a financial liability in accordance with IAS32 and is measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS9. Management have estimated the expected liability to be $3.1 million and the present value as $2.5 million. This financial liability is measured on Level 3, the fair value is derived using a discounted cash flow approach. The discount rate applied to the obligation was 11.64% (2023: n/a). A 1% increase or decrease in the discount rate would decrease or increase the liability by approximately £0.03 million (2023: n/a) and £0.03 million (2023: n/a), respectively. An increase in the liability would result in a loss in the revaluation of financial instruments, while a decrease would result in a gain. There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 in the period. Equity settled derivative financial liability is a liability that is not to be settled for cash. No warrants recognised as equity settled derivatives were exercised in 2023. The Company issues warrants exercisable into ADSs of the Company as part of registered direct offerings and private placements in the US. The number of ADSs to be issued when exercised is fixed, however the exercise price is denominated in US Dollars being different to the functional currency of the Company. Therefore, the warrants are classified as equity settled derivative financial liabilities recognised at fair value through the profit and loss account (‘FVTPL’). The financial liability is valued using the Black-Scholes model. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on re-measurement recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability and is included in the ‘finance income’ or ‘finance expense’ lines item in the income statement. A key input in the valuation of the instrument is the Company share price. Details of the warrants are as follows: May 2024 warrants In May 2024 the Company issued 2,359,012 Series G ADS Warrants and 3,695,218 Series H ADS Warrants as part of the Warrant Inducement Transaction. The exercise price per ADS is $2.50. December 2023 warrants In December 2023 the Company issued 3,000,063 Series E ADS Warrants and 3,000,063 Series F ADS Warrants as part of the Registered Offering in the US. The exercise price per ADS is $2.20. May 2023 warrants In June 2023 the Company issued 276,689 Series D ADS Warrants as part of a registered direct offering and private placement in the US after securing shareholder approval. The exercise price per ADS was $16.00. May 2020 warrants In May 2020 the Company issued 838 ADS warrants as part of a registered direct offering in the US. October 2019 warrants In October 2019 the Company issued 392 ADS warrants as part of a registered direct offering in the US. Warrant re-price On May 22, 2024 the Company entered into agreements with several accredited investors to exercise existing Series E warrants and Series F warrants, issued in December 2023, to purchase up to an aggregate of 4,358,322 ADSs. The warrant holders agreed to exercise the Series E and/or Series F warrants at an exercise price of $1.50 (reduced from $2.20) per ADS. Warrants and Dara share options The Group also assumed fully vested warrants and share options on the acquisition of DARA Biosciences, Inc. (which took place in 2015). The number of ordinary shares to be issued when exercised is fixed, however the exercise prices are denominated in US Dollars. The warrants are classified equity settled derivative financial liabilities and accounted for in the same way as those detailed above. The financial liability is valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The exercise price of the outstanding options is $1,903.40. The following table details the outstanding warrants and options over ADSs and ordinary shares recognised as equity settled derivative financial liabilities as at June 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and also the movement in the year: Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly; and Level 3: techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data. The fair value of the Group’s derivative financial liability is measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The following table gives information about how the fair value of this financial liability is determined. Changing the unobservable risk-free rate input to the valuation model by 10% higher while all other variables were held constant, would not impact the carrying amount of shares (2023: nil). There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 in the period. The financial liability measured at fair value on Level 3 fair value measurement represents consideration relating to warrants issued in May 2024, December 2023, June 2023, May 2020 and October 2019 as part of Private Placements, Registered Direct offerings and the Warrant Inducement Transaction. During the period the Company issued the following warrants over ADSs, and these were recognised in the warrant reserve until exercise: The Series A, Series B and Series C warrants are exercisable on an ‘alternative cashless basis’ effectively allowing the holders to exercise for nil consideration. Ordinary and deferred shares were recorded as equity. The Directors consider there to be no related party transactions during the periods reported other than Directors Remuneration. The Company entered into an Arrangement Agreement with Bioasis on December 13, 2022 as amended on December 18, 2022. Under the agreement the Company agreed to acquire the entire issued share capital of Bioasis for consideration of, in aggregate, approximately C$7.4 million (c£4.4 million). The agreement was subject to shareholder approval. On January 23, 2023 at the General Meeting to approve the Arrangement Agreement none of the special resolutions were passed and, accordingly, the acquisition of Bioasis did not proceed. Under the agreement the Company agreed to reimburse Bioasis US$225,000 for expenses relating to the transaction should the Company’s shareholders not approve the transaction. On March 3, 2023 the Company advised Bioasis that it would offset this liability against the $500,000 loan it advanced to them during December 2022 and January 2023. As at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the Company had a contingent liability of $225,000 in relation to this potential liability. On July 22, 2024, the Company utilised its capacity under its Registration Statement on Form F-3 to raise $5.0 million in gross proceeds in a Registered Direct Offering with certain institutional investors for the sale of an aggregate of 5,050,808 ADSs and 278,975 pre-funded warrants at a price of $0.94 per ADS. In a concurrent Private Placement, the Company issued and sold to the Investors (i) Series J warrants exercisable for 5,329,783 Depositary Shares, and (ii) Series K Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 5,329,783 Depositary Shares. The Series J and Series K warrants are exercisable for five years and one year, respectively, at $1.00 per ADS each. On August 27,2024, the Company , received a Staff Determination letter (the “Letter”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company of the Staff’s determination to delist the Company’s securities from The Nasdaq Capital Market because the Company’s securities have had a closing bid price below $1.00 for 30 consecutive business days, which triggers a notice of delisting pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Rule”). Normally, a company would be afforded a 180-calendar day period to demonstrate compliance with the Rule. However, pursuant to Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iv), the Company is not eligible for any compliance period specified in Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) because the Company effected reverse stock splits over the prior two-year period with a cumulative ratio of 250 shares or more to one. Accordingly, and as described in the Letter, unless the Company timely requested a hearing before a Hearings Panel (the “Panel”), the Company’s securities would be subject to suspension/delisting. Accordingly, the Company requested a hearing before the Panel. The hearing request will automatically stay any suspension or delisting action pending the hearing and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the Panel following the hearing. On September 19, 2024, the Company announced a ratio change on its ADSs from one (1) ADS representing four hundred (400) ordinary shares, to the new ratio of one (1) ADS representing ten thousand (10,000) ordinary shares (the "Ratio Change"). The effective date of the Ratio Change is expected to be October 4,2024. vv Attachment

Title: Elon Musk is $100 billion richer than in April thanks to Tesla's stock surge — and worth more than McDonald's or Pepsi

Elon Musk is riding high again after a rough start to the year. The Tesla CEO's net worth crashed from $229 billion at the start of January to $164 billion by late April, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The $65 billion decline was fueled by Tesla stock tanking more than 40% in that period. However, shares of the EV maker have surged by over 80% from their April low, driving a more than $100 billion increase in Musk's wealth to $270 billion at Wednesday's close. That includes an almost $50 billion rise since August 7, when Musk's fortune stood at an estimated $223 billion. The epic comeback means Musk went from being the world's biggest wealth loser for the year in April, to the fourth-greatest gainer with a $41 billion increase. Only Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, and Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison have grown their net worth more. Musk also remains easily the richest person on the planet with a $270 billion fortune — worth more than corporate titans like Salesforce ($262 billion), PepsiCo ($233 billion), or McDonald's ($216 billion). Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, worth $215 billion, and Zuckerberg, worth $202 billion, still trail him by a distance. Yet it's worth noting that Musk has been much richer in the past. In November 2021, he was worth an astounding $340 billion. Tesla stock is down nearly 40% from there, leaving Musk about $70 billion poorer than at his peak. Musk's wealth rebound this year reflects renewed optimism about not just Tesla but the wider stock market and US economy. The Federal Reserve recently made its first cut to interest rates after hiking them from nearly zero to north of 5% in under 16 months, pushing stocks to record highs and easing inflation and recession fears. The Tesla chief warned last year that soaring prices, steeper rates, and a looming downturn were bad news for his company. Consumers had less disposable income to spend on a car, buying one had become more costly and difficult due to higher borrowing costs and stricter lending, and people may have been holding off buying a new car until the economy improved, he said. In April, Musk announced sweeping layoffs, Tesla published disappointing first-quarter delivery numbers, and investors fretted about price cuts squeezing profit margins and Chinese rivals like BYD taking market share from Tesla. Those myriad concerns tanked the stock, but signs of easing economic pressures have underpinned a recovery in recent weeks. It's worth noting that Musk's vast fortune also reflects his roughly 42% ownership of SpaceX, the rocket company valued at $210 billion in June, and his stakes in X, Neuralink, xAI, and The Boring Company.

Keating, the congress member representing Massachusetts's 9th congressional district, recently made several transactions from his Individual Retirement Account (IRA), as per the latest congressional trade report. Among the most notable transactions, Keating sold a portion of his holdings in Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Inc. Common Stock (NYSE:CAT) and NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) N.V. - Common Stock (NASDAQ:NXPI). Both transactions were valued between $1,001 and $15,000. In addition to the above, Keating also partially sold his holdings in several corporate securities, including those from Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) & Co, Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Elevance Health Inc, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co, Lowe's Companies Inc (NYSE:LOW), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc, T-Mobile USA Inc, Union Pacific Corp (NYSE:UNP), and Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ). Each of these transactions was valued between $1,001 and $15,000. Interestingly, two transactions stood out with a higher value. Keating partially sold his holdings in a Comcast Corp note, valued between $15,001 and $50,000. Furthermore, he sold his United States Treasury Series C-2032 note, also valued between $15,001 and $50,000. All transactions were conducted on September 11, 2024, and were reported on September 23, 2024. These trades, as per the report, were made from Keating's IRA, an investment vehicle commonly used by individuals to earmark funds for retirement savings. As investors keep a keen eye on the financial activities of influential figures like congress members, these transactions by Keating provide useful insights. However, as always, it's essential for investors to conduct their own research and consider various factors before making investment decisions. As William R. Keating adjusts his investment portfolio, it's worth noting the recent performance and outlook of Caterpillar, Inc. (NYSE:CAT), one of the stocks he has sold. According to InvestingPro data, Caterpillar has a robust market capitalization of $183.7 billion and has been demonstrating financial resilience. The company's P/E ratio stands at 17.2, reflecting a valuation that is attractive relative to near-term earnings growth, an observation that aligns with an InvestingPro Tip highlighting the company's low P/E ratio in the context of its earnings growth. Investors tracking dividend reliability will find Caterpillar's dividend history compelling, as the company has not only maintained dividend payments for an impressive 54 consecutive years but has also raised its dividend for 10 consecutive years. This consistency in rewarding shareholders is a testament to the company's financial stability and commitment to returning value to its investors, a point that is underscored by two separate InvestingPro Tips. For those looking at stock performance, Caterpillar has delivered a strong return over the last three months, with a price total return of 16.0%. This robust short-term performance is part of a longer trend, as the company has also enjoyed a high return over the last decade. Caterpillar's operational strength is further reflected in its gross profit margin of 32.72% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, indicating a healthy ability to manage costs and sustain profitability. For investors interested in a deeper dive into Caterpillar's financials and performance metrics, InvestingPro offers additional tips and insights.

Title: Watch These Meta Platforms Price Levels as Stock Sets Record High

Meta Platforms (META) shares will likely remain in focus for the remainder of the week after the tech titan’s stock set a record high on Wednesday and the company kicked off its annual Connect conference. The company unveiled a lower-cost Quest 3S headset, Orion augmented reality glasses, new artificial intelligence (AI) features, and other tech gadgets at the highly anticipated event. The Facebook and Instagram parent has also turned to celebrities, announcing deals with actors Awkwafina, John Cena, and Judi Dench, among others, that will allow the company to use their voices in a new AI assistant. Since the start of the year, Meta’s stock has gained around 60% through Wednesday’s close as the social media company's latest quarterly results indicate that significant investments in AI infrastructure and product innovations have started to translate into higher advertising revenue and earnings. Meta shares gained 0.9% on Wednesday to finish at $568.31, after surging to an all-time high of $576.88 during the session. Below, we take a closer look at the technicals on Meta’s chart and identify important price levels to watch out for. Meta shares broke out from a five-month ascending triangle on above-average volume earlier this month, with the stock price continuing to track higher into its Connect 2024 conference. The stock’s breakout coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) moving into overbought territory to confirm bullish price momentum but also caution of short-term stretched conditions. To forecast potential price targets above the stock’s all-time high (ATH), investors can use the measuring principle and a more subjective bars pattern. Let’s look at each in further detail. To project a price target using the measuring principle, we calculate the distance of the ascending triangle near its widest point and add that amount to the pattern’s top trendline. For instance, we add $165 to $535, which forecasts an upside target in the stock at $700. Speculating an upside target using a bars pattern works by using a prior trending move to forecast a potential future move, assuming price action tends to rhyme. In this case, we extract the stock’s trend higher from December to March and reposition it from this month’s low, which projects a price target of around $790. We selected this prior move because it commenced from an earlier ascending triangle’s lower trendline on Meta’s chart, similar to the stock’s price action from the most recent ascending triangle. Given the RSI indicator points to overbought conditions in the stock, investors should also keep a close eye on the $535 level, an area on the chart where prior resistance could become future support near the ascending triangle's upper trendline. Market participants who prefer to trade pullbacks rather than chase breakouts could look for buying opportunities near this area.

Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) Chief Product Officer, Christopher K. Cox, has recently sold a portion of his holdings in the company. The transaction, which took place on September 23, involved the sale of 10,000 shares of Class A common stock at a price of $569.93 per share, amounting to a total of over $5.6 million. This sale was conducted under a prearranged 10b5-1 trading plan, which allows company insiders to sell shares at a predetermined time to avoid accusations of trading on nonpublic information. The shares sold by Cox were held by the Christopher K. Cox Revocable Trust, for which he is the trustee. Following the sale, Cox's trust still retains a significant stake in the company, with 328,662 shares of Meta Platforms' Class A common stock remaining. Additionally, Cox is associated with the Cox-Vadakan Irrevocable Remainder Trust, which holds 55,046 shares. Investors often monitor insider sales as they may provide insights into executives' views on the company's current valuation and future prospects. However, it is important to note that such transactions do not necessarily indicate a lack of confidence in the company; they may be part of personal financial planning or diversification strategies. Meta Platforms, Inc., formerly known as Facebook Inc ., is a leader in the technology sector, specifically within the computer programming and data processing industry. The company has made significant strides in recent years to expand its offerings beyond social media, delving into areas such as virtual reality and augmented reality. The sale by Cox was officially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 25, with Erin Guldiken signing as attorney-in-fact for Christopher K. Cox. As insiders' transactions are publicly disclosed, investors have the opportunity to stay informed about the financial moves of Meta Platforms' top executives. In other recent news, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). has been actively showcasing its advancements in augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The company's annual Connect conference highlighted the development of its first AR glasses, and an update to its AI chatbot feature that now allows users to select a voice of their choice. Despite technical challenges, Meta continues to invest heavily in AI and AR technologies, with projected capital expenses for 2024 estimated to be between $37 billion to $40 billion. Simultaneously, Meta has decided to hold off on joining the European Union's AI Pact, focusing instead on complying with the upcoming EU's Artificial Intelligence Act. The Act, set to be implemented by August 2, 2026, will require companies to provide detailed accounts of the data used to train their AI models. In the financial realm, both Roth Capital and BofA Securities have provided positive outlooks on Meta's shares. Roth Capital highlighted a steady increase in the company's cost per thousand impressions, a key indicator of robust advertising demand. BofA Securities maintained its Buy rating for Meta, anticipating the launch of advanced AI chat options and new AI capabilities for WhatsApp and Messenger. In its push towards environmental responsibility, Meta has secured up to 3.9 million carbon offset credits in a deal with BTG Pactual’s forestry arm, marking the company's most significant carbon removal procurement from a single project to date. This is part of Meta's strategy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030. Lastly, Meta along with other tech giants is engaged with the European Union regarding the upcoming enforcement of the AI Act. The companies are participating in the drafting of the codes of practice for the new legislation, expected to be finalized by late next year. These are the recent developments involving Meta Platforms Inc. Amidst the news of Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) Chief Product Officer, Christopher K. Cox, selling a portion of his holdings, current and potential investors may find it beneficial to consider additional metrics and tips from InvestingPro.

InvestingPro Tips suggest that Meta Platforms holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, providing the company with financial flexibility and resilience. Moreover, the company's P/E ratio is 28.42, which, when adjusted for near-term earnings growth, becomes even more attractive at 26.66.

Title: Meta Unveils Budget-Friendly Quest 3S Headset for the VR Curious

Mark Zuckerberg is trying once again to bring VR to the masses, this time through a new Quest 3S headset that arrives next month starting at $299. The device promises to offer the same high-quality VR experience found in last year’s pricier Quest 3, for $200 less. “We’ve been working on bringing the Quest 3 family to a lot more people,” Zuckerberg said at the Meta Connect conference on Wednesday. The resulting Quest 3S looks similar, but Meta is indicating it reduced the product’s cost by changing the lens inside the headset. The new headset uses a “fresnel lens” with a lower resolution of 1,832 by 1,920 or 773 pixels per inch. The Quest 3, on the other hand, features “pancake lenses,” which can offer a higher resolution at 2,064 by 2,208 or 1218ppi. In addition, the 3S has a lower field of view at 96 degrees versus 110 degrees, according to the company’s comparison page. The other noticeable change is the exterior cameras, which are positioned differently, although both VR headsets offer full color passthrough, enabling you to view your real-world surroundings while wearing the device. The passthrough is the key to both the Quest 3 and 3S offering a "mixed reality" experience, meaning you can overlay virtual icons and windows on real-world sights. This will eventually include running the Windows OS remotely though the headset, according to Zuckerberg. On the plus side, the 3S can run a little longer, at 2.5 hours per battery charge, despite having a slightly smaller battery. Both headsets also use the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen2 processor and contain 8GB of RAM, which is perhaps why Zuckerberg said the 3S offers the same “defining features” as the Quest 3, including hand-tracking. The company is marketing the Quest 3S for people new to mixed reality experiences, or “who might have been waiting for a low-cost upgrade.” Preorders for Quest 3S start today with the company charging $299 for the 128GB model and $399 for the 256GB model. The product is then slated to start shipping on Oct. 15. Stay tuned for our review. Meta is also cutting the price of the 512GB Quest 3 from $649.99 to $499. The 128GB version of the Quest 3, which also goes for $499, is out of stock.

Title: Google paid $2.7B to rehire AI genius who left after company refused to release his bot: report
URL: https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/business/google-paid-2-7b-to-rehire-ai-genius-who-left-for-startup/
Time Published: 2024-09-25T18:29:46Z
Full Content:
Google paid $2.7 billion to rehire an artificial intelligence genius who left the tech giant in a huff three years ago to found his own startup, according to a report. Noam Shazeer, a 48-year-old software engineer who was first hired by Google as one of its first few hundred employees back in 2000, left the company in 2021 after it refused his request to release a chat bot that he had developed with a colleague, Daniel De Freitas. Shazeer and De Freitas went on to found Character.AI, which grew to become one of the hottest AI startups in Silicon Valley that would eventually reach a $1 billion valuation last year. Last month, Google and Character.AI announced that Shazeer, De Freitas and certain members of Character.AI’s research team would be joining Google’s AI unit DeepMind. At the time of the deal, Character.AI said that it had more than 20 million monthly active users. Google paid Character.AI $2.7 billion to license its technology as well as to get Shazeer and his team to agree to work for the company, according to The Wall Street Journal. The licensing deal, which is short of a full-fledged acquisition, is a unique arrangement that allows Google to immediately access Character.AI’s intellectual property without having to wait for the regulatory approvals and bureaucratic sign-offs that would have been required if the company was bought outright. Shazeer’s return to Google is widely viewed among company employees as the primary reason behind the acquisition of Character.AI, the Journal reported. Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google, was reportedly impressed with Shazeer — so much so that he was convinced he would be able to build an AI model that could operate with human-level intelligence, according to the Journal. “If there’s anybody I can think of in the world who’s likely to do it, it’s going to be him,” Schmidt was quoted as saying of Shazeer during a talk at Stanford University in 2015. In 2017, Shazeer and another Google colleague, De Freitas, teamed up to create Meena, a chat bot that could engage humans on a range of issues. According to the Journal, Shazeer was so confident of Meena’s utility that he predicted it would one day replace Google’s search engine. But Google executives thought it was too risky to release Meena due to concerns about safety and fairness, the Journal reported. Google tapped Shazeer, who netted hundreds of millions of dollars in the transaction, to be one of three people who will lead the company’s efforts to build the next version of Gemini, Google’s next-generation AI model that was built to compete with rivals such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Earlier this year, Google temporarily suspended Gemini’s image-generating feature after it produced inaccurate “woke” depictions such as minority founding father and diverse popes. Subscribe to our daily Business Report newsletter! Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. Last month, Google lifted the suspension and allowed users to create images using prompts after fixing the bugs. The steep price that Google paid to bring Shazeer and De Freitas back into the fold is indicative of the expensive race among Silicon Valley tech giants to hire the best talent during the AI era — particularly in the wake of OpenAI’s rollout of ChatGPT. The talent wars have heated up to the point where Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google co-founder Sergey Brin personally wrote notes to recruits urging them to come aboard. Brin is reportedly the key figure in helping to persuade Shazeer to return to Google, according to the Journal. Companies like OpenAI pay prized recruits compensation packages ranging from $5 million to $10 million — mostly in the form of stock. Meta has developed a reputation for being somewhat stingy, offering pay packages of between $1 million and $2 million, according to data unearthed by the tech-centric news site The Information.

Title: Meta will stop selling the Quest 2 and Quest Pro by the end of the year

Meta just revealed the budget-friendly Quest 3S VR headset at its annual Connect keynote event, but it also made a sad announcement about some of its previous headsets. The company will stop selling both the Quest 2 and the Quest Pro by the end of the year. “With Quest 3S on the shelf, we’re officially winding down sales of Quest 2 and Pro. We’ll be selling our remaining headsets through the end of the year or until they’re gone, whichever comes first,” the company wrote in a blog post that also announced the pending launch of the Quest 3S. The company will be selling Quest 2 and Pro accessories for “a bit longer” after the stock of headsets runs out. This includes the carrying case, the Touch Pro controllers and bundles like the Quest 2 Active Pack. Meta recently lowered the price of the Quest 2 to $200, and it’s still a decent headset for beginners. The Quest 3S is better in every way, but it starts at $300, while the standard Quest 3 costs $500. It’s the end of an era for the Quest 2. This was a hugely successful headset, as it launched during the dog days of COVID-19. For many, it became a crucial item to survive endless isolation, along with stuff like Zoom and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. It’s the end of an error (see what I did there?) for the Quest Pro. This headset never caught on, likely because it was originally priced at $1,500 before being quickly lowered to $1,000. It still costs a grand from Meta, but can typically be found for around $900 via Amazon and other retailers. As they say, out with the old and in with the new. The Quest 3S is, essentially, the new Quest 2. It starts at $300, boasts the same CPU as the original Quest 3 and handles full-color passthrough.

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. The Meta Quest 3S is Meta's new budget-friendly standalone VR headset, and you can preorder now ahead of its October 15 release. By Steven Petite on September 26, 2024 at 3:57PM PDT Meta Quest 3S (128GB) + Batman: Arkham Shadow Bundle $300 Meta Quest 3S (256GB) + Batman: Arkham Shadow Bundle $400 Meta Quest 3 (512GB) + Batman: Arkham Shadow Bundle $500 The newly announced Meta Quest 3S has a pretty awesome launch bundle that makes the already budget-friendly headset more enticing. From now until April 30, 2025, while supplies last, the Quest 3S will come bundled with Batman: Arkham Shadow, a Quest 3-exclusive action game that pits the Caped Crusader against the Rat King. The Meta Quest 3S launch bundle is available in both storage configurations: 128GB for $300 and 256GB for $400. Preorders are live now at multiple major retailers, including Amazon and Walmart, ahead of the headset's October 15 release date. Announced during Meta Connect 2024, the Quest 3S has the same chipset as the standard Quest 3, the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2, and the same amount of RAM (8GB). Just like with the Quest 3, you'll get a pair of Touch Pro controllers that support gesture controls to navigate menus. Battery life, according to Meta, is slightly better with the Quest 3S, with an average playtime between charges of two-and-a-half hours instead of two hours with the regular Quest 3. Where it cuts costs is with the lenses. The Quest 3S is fitted with the 1832 x 1920 fresnel lenses found in the Meta Quest 2, whereas the pricier Meta Quest 3 has 2064 x 2208 pancake lenses for improved resolution and clarity. In addition to the lower-resolution lenses, the Quest 3S drops the depth sensor and has a narrower field of vision. Meta also significantly reduced the price of the regular 512GB Quest 3, which is eligible for the same bundle offer, and discontinued the 128GB Quest 3 (now on clearance for $430). Meta Quest 3 VR headset options: Check out the new Meta Quest 3S bundles below: The base model 128GB Meta Quest 3S costs $300, the same price as the now-discontinued Meta Quest 2. Not only are you getting a more advanced piece of tech for the same price, Meta is throwing in one of the most exciting upcoming Meta Quest 3 and 3S exclusives, Batman: Arkham Shadow. The new Batman game releases October 22, one week after the Quest 3S arrives. The limited-time Meta Quest 3S bundle also comes with three months of Meta Quest+, a subscription program that normally costs $8 per month. With Quest+, you get two free games each month (valued up to $50). Even if you cancel your subscription, you get to keep those freebies. If you're new to the Meta Quest ecosystem, you're essentially getting seven free games with the purchase of the Quest 3S. Since the Quest 3S launches in October, you'll get two free games each month through the end of the year. Amazon also has a bundle that includes the Elite Strap, one of the most popular first-party accessories for Meta Quest headsets. The Elite Strap replaces the default band and is designed to provide better weight distribution to minimize pressure on your face. The strap is fitted with a dial that allows you to make quick adjustments. You can preorder the Meta Quest 3S bundle with the Elite Strap for $365.73 at Amazon. If Amazon drops the price bundle prior to launch, you'll pay the lowest price offered when your preorder is shipped. If you're unsure about the Elite Strap, you can buy it separately later on. At the moment, buying the headset and Elite Strap separately costs the same price as the bundle at Amazon. The 256GB Meta Quest 3S is available to preorder for $400 at Amazon. Like the 128GB version, you'll get Batman: Arkham Shadow and three months of Meta+. Amazon has the Quest 3S 256GB bundle with the Elite Strap included for $465.73. If you want to play Batman: Arkham Shadow but would rather opt for the more powerful Meta Quest 3, the same bundle is available to purchase now at Amazon. The Meta Quest 3 Batman: Arkham Shadow bundle costs $500, which sounds like quite the deal considering the price of the 512GB Quest 3 up until now. Meta revealed the bundle alongside a price drop for the Quest 3. The 512GB model previously cost $650 and will now go for $500. The 128GB model is being discontinued, but remaining stock will be sold for $430 (was $500). As a result of its discontinuation, the 128GB Quest 3 will not be available in the new Batman bundle, but you can buy the headset now for $429 at Walmart.

Title: I tried out Meta's Orion computer glasses. I'd buy them in a heartbeat — if they were actually for sale.

Peter Kafka, Chief Correspondent covering media and technology Here is what you need to know about Orion, the new computer-on-your-face nerd glasses Mark Zuckerberg showed off today: Each pair of glasses reportedly costs Meta $10,000 to make, and the company says it needs time to get them to a price that makes them plausible — think something in the $1,000-ish range, like a laptop or high-end phone. (That $10,000 number comes from The Verge's Alex Heath. Meta declined to comment on the number). If all goes well, it could take a few years for that to happen. 2. I've tried them, and they are very cool! They don't make you look cool — you look like someone wearing tech on your face — but the ideas and engineering behind them are really fascinating. If you're one of the people who complains that Silicon Valley hasn't made anything except soul-sucking social networks and monetization machines for years, here's a compelling counter. More important: Unlike other face-computing tech I've tried over the years — Google's Glass, Apple's Vision Pro, Meta's own line of Quest goggles — this is one I can actually imagine buying, and using, in real life. My brief experience with Orion comes with major caveats. The biggest is that it's not actually ready for mass production. But if this pans out, it will deliver what lots of people in tech, and outside tech, say they want: a wearable computer jammed into a pair of glasses. What would you do with a wearable computer? For starters, lots of things you can do with a phone: Take and make phone calls and video calls. Send and receive texts. Take photos and videos. Watch videos. Play time-wasting games. Play around with AI. And because Orion sits on your face like glasses — bulky glasses that use silicon carbide instead of glass — you can do all those things while looking at, and interacting with, everything and everyone around you. This is "augmented reality" — digital images laid over the real world. As opposed to "virtual reality" — where you are totally enveloped by a digital landscape. There are obvious downsides to this. If you think it's frustrating to talk to someone who keeps looking at their phone to check a text or a viral video, imagine what it will be like to hold a conversation with someone who's staring at you and staring at something else at the very same time.* But there are very intriguing upsides, too. Most obviously: Picture yourself with a task — like changing a tire, making marinara, or solving a math problem — and the ability to simultaneously look at the thing you want to do and instructions on how to do it. Orion uses eye tracking, which means you select digital items just by looking at them. And you manipulate them — turn an app on or off, respond to a text message, swipe through videos on Reels — by making subtle flicks and clicks with your fingers. Those gestures get registered by a snug-but-not-bulky wristband** that registers your muscles' movements using electromyography*** and transmits them wirelessly to your glasses. Orion also comes the closest I've seen to a face computer you could take for a stroll. Unlike other devices I've seen, it doesn't need to be plugged into a bulky power source or tethered to a phone. Instead, it connects wirelessly to a TV-remote-sized power/computing device you can slip into your pocket that connects to the internet via WiFi or cell signals. Meta says its battery will last for two to three hours of continual use. And here, I'm going to stop talking about Orion's specs. Because it seems pretty silly to get very deep into a thing that's still in development and may never actually materialize for mass production. It's also important to stress that my brief demo time was in a Meta building, surrounded by Meta employees who guided me through a Meta-scripted walk-through. I have no idea how, or if, this thing works in the real world. Neither do Meta executives, really. They say they're about to start "dogfooding" the device with lots of employees to get a better sense of how it performs while continuing to figure out how to make it lighter and cheaper. Which brings us to two questions about Zuckerberg's reveal this week. First: Why is Meta showing off something no one's going to be able to buy — at best — for years? This reminds me of pre-iPhone reveals, where it was common for tech companies to show you stuff they might make one day, but very often didn't. When I ask Meta executives that question, they murmur about wanting their fellow employees to see the work they're doing, and to be encouraged by the progress they're making. But surely there are other ways to pump up morale — like having a record-high stock price, which happens to have happened this week. My theory relates to that stock price: that Zuckerberg, who has gotten grief over the years for plowing billions into his metaverse dreams, wants to show the world — and specifically investors — that all those dollars weren't wasted. And that he's getting very close to a consumer device people might buy in very large numbers. Which brings us to my second question: Why does Meta, whose online ad business is one of the world's greatest money-printing machines, want to make hardware anyway? That one is easier to answer. Most practically: As great as that money-printing machine is, it can't work without phones made by Apple and Google — companies that force Meta to play by their rules and restrictions. If Orion, or any other device Meta makes, becomes the future of computing, then Zuckerberg can operate his business on his devices. But if you're into vibes-based answers: Orion's debut is part of the Mark Zuckerberg 3.0 era. One where he says he's done apologizing (even though he's still apologizing) and done with politics (even though politics is not done with him). One where he's trying new looks (including his own designs). So if he wants to take a victory lap with very cool new tech — even if the tech isn't quite ready for prime time? He's going to do that, too. *The entire time I played with Orion, I kept thinking about teenagers I see walking around with a single AirPod in their ear at all times. The idea, supposedly, is that they can keep listening to whatever they want while begrudgingly listening to you, too. I find that half-in, half-out way of interacting with the world incredibly frustrating. But I'm old. Your mileage may vary. **For whatever reason, some Meta people call this a "neural wristband," which makes it seem like it's somehow reading your brain. Thankfully, it is not. ***(I had never heard of this term before this week, either.) Jump to

Title: Meta Will Discontinue Quest 2 & Quest Pro By The End Of The Year

Quest 2 and Quest Pro will no longer be available when stock runs out or at the end of the year, whichever comes first. Meta made the announcement today at Meta Connect 2024. It comes as the company officially revealed and opened preorders for Quest 3S, starting at $300, and announced that it's also discontinuing the 128GB Quest 3 after cutting the price of the 512GB Quest 3 model to $500. When Quest 2, Quest Pro, and the 128GB Quest 3 are gone, Meta's headset lineup will be simplified to: Quest 2 launched in 2020 with a remarkable proposition: a twice as powerful chipset and higher resolution than the original Oculus Quest at a $100 lower price. Sure it also lost the OLED and precise lens separation adjustment of its predecessor, but this didn't seem to matter much as the improved graphics and $300 price point propelled Quest 2 to a level of success no other VR headset has reached before or since. Quest 2 outsold all its predecessors combined within 6 months of being on sale. Meta has now shipped an estimated 20-30 million Quest 2 units through its four years on the market, similar to the number of Xbox Series X/S consoles sold so far. The first major standalone VR games to not support Quest 2 are launching soon, but many other VR apps will likely support Quest 2 for many years to come, and Quest 2's lenses and display will live on in Quest 3S. Building on the success of Quest 2, two years later Meta hoped it could introduce a high-end Quest to serve enthusiasts and businesses. Quest Pro launched in 2022 at $1500. It featured Meta's first pancake lenses, QD-LCD displays with Mini-LED local dimming, eye tracking, face tracking, a battery in the rear of the strap, and ringless self-tracking Touch Pro controllers. In many ways Quest Pro was a pioneering headset. But in others it was lacking. By the time Quest Pro launched, leaks of a Quest 3 arriving a year later with a twice as powerful chipset at half the price had already emerged, severely dampening the headset's value proposition. Further, Quest Pro's underwhelming resolution, grainy passthrough, lack of automatic room sensing for mixed reality, and Meta’s cartoonish avatars not being detailed enough to do the face tracking sensors justice led to mixed-at-best reviews. Just four months after Quest Pro launched Meta cut its price from $1500 to $1000. This kind of price cut so soon after launch was unprecedented, and strongly suggests the headset vastly missed its launch sales targets. By around a year after launch Meta was giving away Quest Pro headsets to Roblox creators, when giving them a Quest 2 would have been perfectly fine. And earlier this year Meta removed the whiteboard, which was designed around the pressure-sensitive stylus tips of Quest Pro's controllers, from Horizon Workrooms. Multiple developers have told UploadVR they see only a tiny fraction of their user base on Quest Pro. As such, almost no Quest game developers took the time to add support for its eye-tracked foveated rendering. When Quest Pro is off the market, Meta will no longer be selling any headsets with eye tracking or face tracking. It's possible one of its Horizon OS partners, such as ASUS or Lenovo, will release a headset with these features some time next year. Get a weekly summary of the most important VR and AR news.

Title: Meta Just Cut The 512GB Quest 3 To $500 And Will Discontinue The 128GB Model

Time Published: 2024-09-25T17:25:00Z

The 128GB storage model of Quest 3 is being discontinued, and the 512GB model has been cut to its $500 price. Quest 3 launched a year ago with two models, 128GB storage for $500 or 512GB for $650. When stock of the 128GB model depletes, the 512GB option will be the sole Quest 3 model. Until that happens, the 128GB model is available at a discounted price of $430. This announcement comes as Meta just officially revealed and opened preorders for Quest 3S, a cheaper headset that has the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset and color passthrough mixed reality capabilities as Quest 3, but uses the old fresnel lenses and single panel from Quest 2. Meta also announced that it's discontinuing Quest 2 and Quest Pro by the end of the year or when stock runs out, whichever comes first. When Quest 2, Quest Pro, and the 128GB Quest 3 are gone, Meta's headset lineup will be simplified to: As well as simplifying Meta's lineup, this move could push many potential Quest 3S 256GB buyers up to Quest 3, since for $100 more they can get a slimmer headset with double the storage, pancake lenses, higher resolution, and precise IPD adjustment.

Title: Meta Quest 3S vs. Quest 3: More similar than you'd expect

Time Published: 2024-09-25T17:21:25Z

No offers found You'll be shocked how alike the Meta Quest 3S is to the costlier Quest 3, though some budget-friendly Quest 2 traits return. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Affordable upgrade Meta has made VR more accessible to consumers again by bringing next-gen gaming and mixed reality apps to the same price point that made the Quest 2 so popular. Its lenses and display are unchanged from the previous generation, but it's more powerful and versatile than ever. Full upgrade The Meta Quest 3 has the same game library and graphical power as the Quest 3S but makes those games more visually appealing with more pixels and a wider view. Plus you get all the storage space you could want. Whether that's enough to pay the extra $200 is up to you. The Meta Quest 3S is here as a low-priced alternative to the Quest 3. If you compare the Meta Quest 3S vs. Quest 3 closely, you'll note a ton of similarities. Although it looks like a Quest 2 with new cameras, it shares more in common with the newer headset, from performance to accessories. If you're a Quest 2 owner, you might have been put off by the Quest 3's higher price and held off on upgrading. Now, the Quest 3S has the same price and many of the same upgrades; however, Meta has also discounted the Quest 3 512GB from $649 to $499 — the original price for the 128GB Quest 3 — and now's a good time to choose the mainline headset, too. Based on our year testing out the Quest 3 and our Quest 3S hands-on demo at Connect, we'll break down every main similarity and difference between the Meta Quest 3S and Quest 3! The Meta Quest 3S is essentially a hybrid between the Quest 2 visuals and Quest 3 hardware. Before breaking down the specific downgrades, we'll explain every way that the Quest 3S will modernize things for Quest 2 users. New CPU & extra RAM: Both the Quest 3 and 3S share the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip and 8GB of RAM. Meta says this combination delivers twice-as-fast GPU performance for faster loading times. Even though the Quest 2 and 3 share most of the same games, the Quest 3 version will often have an exclusive patch with graphical enhancements like higher refresh rates, reduced fog, better lighting and shadows, more enemies or environmental objects on screen at once, better colors, and improved textures. Quest 3 exclusives: Most developers try to target both the Quest 2 and Quest 3, but some upcoming AAA games will be Quest 3 exclusives because they're too graphically demanding for the Quest 2's headset. So far, we know of Batman: Arkham Shadow, Alien: Rogue Incursion, and the recently-released Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded. Aside from those, many other upcoming Quest games are Quest 3-exclusive because they need full-color passthrough with high mixed-reality resolution to work well. Full-color passthrough: Despite the different camera configuration, the Meta Quest 3S has the same 4MP RGB camera with 18 pixels per degree (PPD) passthrough resolution, letting you see your living room in full color, if not at quite the same resolution as full virtual reality. Mixed-reality games were gimmicky and unpolished when the Quest 3 first launched, but these games have improved significantly in 2024; on the hardware end, Meta fixed mixed-reality warping and made MR apps use 80% less GPU processing in software updates over the summer. With the Quest 3S, you're getting a better MR experience right from the start. Controllers: The Meta Quest 3S uses Touch Plus controllers, the same controller generation as the Quest 3. These controllers remove the bulky tracking ring, relying on LEDs around the controller body for inside-out tracking. They also add improved haptics. Weight: Even though the Meta Quest 3S is thicker than the Quest 3, it weighs 1g less (514 vs. 515g), making the fit experience pretty darn comparable. Accessories: We were surprised to learn that most of the best Quest 3 accessories should carry over to the Quest 3S. According to Meta, its first-party carrying case, Elite Strap, Elite Strap with Battery, Touch Plus Active Straps, Compact Charging Dock, and Link cable will work with the Quest 3S, too. We assume that our favorite third-party Elite Straps will work as well; we'll test this as soon as we have our Quest 3S review unit. The obvious aesthetic difference with the front cameras aside, both the Meta Quest 3S and Quest 3 look very similar to one another, with the white plastic frame, sensors along the edge, and Meta label in front. One small design difference is that Meta removed the Quest 3's 3.5mm headphone jack from the left arm and moved its right-side USB-C charging port to the left. That gives you fewer headphone options than before; your best bet is wireless earbuds with a USB-C dongle that allows for charging passthrough, so you can still use a battery pack. The Meta Quest 3 was the first to use pancake lenses, with a flattened, reflective design that takes up less horizontal space but also requires more brightness. Most other VR headsets use thicker Fresnel lenses that make them front-heavy and have a noticeable "sweet spot" at the center. Our Quest 3 reviewer specifically praised the pancake lenses for eliminating that sweet spot for better visual clarity. One of the Quest 3S' cost cutbacks is using a Fresnel lens. Meta managed to make the Quest 3S 19.3mm thinner than the Quest 2, but it's still 11.6mm thicker than the Quest 3, shifting the weight forward. Just as many people upgraded the Quest 2 with an Elite Strap for better support and security during fast-paced VR games, you'll probably want the same for the Quest 3S. Visually, the Quest 3 and Quest 3S both use LCDs, but the Quest 3 (2,064 x 2,208) gives you 30% higher resolution than the Quest 3S (1,832 x 1,920, or the same as the Quest 2 display). That, combined with the Fresnel sweet spot, will make the visual experience familiar to Quest 2 owners and detract a bit from the next-gen graphics. Also, the Meta Quest 3S shares the Quest 2's shorter and narrower field of view (FoV) compared to the Quest 3. Unfortunately, the Meta Quest 3S brought back the Quest 2's interpupillary distance (IPD) system to save money. You can slide the lenses to three preset distances — 58mm, 63mm, or 68mm — instead of the IPD wheel and 1mm gaps from 53mm to 75mm you get on the Quest 3. During our hands-on, we found you could slide the Quest 3S lenses in-between those three IPD presets (about 60mm or 65mm), in case your personal IPD doesn't match one of those three presets; it's just trickier and less exact than on the Quest 3. Because the Quest 3S made these lens and design changes, Quest 3 facial interfaces won't work with the Quest 3S; Meta will sell a unique "Quest 3S Breathable Facial Interface" if you want a comfort upgrade for VR workouts. Meta started out selling the Quest 3 in 128GB and 512GB versions, but it's phasing out the 128GB model and making 512GB the default. The Quest 3S will ship in 128GB and 256GB sizes, matching the Quest 2 before it went out of stock. Most casual VR gamers will happily make do with 128GB of space; your average VR game takes up 5GB or less, though some of the major titles are 10GB or more. Both headsets use camera sensors to track your controllers or hands and map your surroundings so you don't hurt yourself, as well as a 4MP RGB camera for full-color passthrough. The only camera difference is that Meta gave the Quest 3 a physical depth sensor to determine how close or far away things are, while the Quest 3S uses software to detect it (as the Quest 2 did). Both the Quest 3 and 3S burn through battery quickly because of the Snapdragon XR2 and 8GB of RAM. But even though the Quest 3S (4,324mAh capacity) has a smaller battery than the Quest 3 (5,060 mAh), Meta estimates that the Quest 3S lasts about 18 minutes longer per charge (2.5 hours versus 2.2 hours). We assume that the Quest 3's higher resolution and brighter pancake lenses require more power, making the Quest 3S more efficient. We've asked Meta for confirmation on this. If you own the Quest 2 and want a new VR headset, then you're probably already happy with the level of immersion the Quest 3S will offer with the same resolution and lens. The Quest 3 resolution and storage boost would certainly be nice to have, but maybe not nice enough to justify spending another $200. Because it has the same CPU and memory, the Quest 3S will handle all the same VR and MR games equally well, receive support for the same amount of time, and do slightly better for battery life. It may feel more front-heavy, but an Elite Strap will fix that; frankly, we think the Quest 3 needs an Elite Strap for long-term comfort too, so you'll have to spend the extra money either way. Even though we'll still rank the Meta Quest 3 as the best VR headset today, the Quest 3S will be good enough for everyone who skipped the pricier headset. Affordable upgrade Choose the Meta Quest 3S if you want the power, game library, and mixed-reality passthrough of the Quest 3 for a lower price. Don't choose it if you dislike the Quest 2's visual experience and want something truly next-gen. Full upgrade Choose the Meta Quest 3 for the most storage, a pixel-packed display, wider field of view, and better hand tracking via the depth sensor. Skip it if you're on a budget and can make do without every possible feature.

Goodbye Quest 2, Quest Pro, and 128GB Quest 3 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta has launched the Meta Quest 3S (you can check out our hands on Meta Quest 3S review for our thoughts on it) and introduced us to a new affordable member of the Quest family, and also killed off three others. It’s time to officially say goodbye to the Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro, and the 128GB model of the Meta Quest 3. The Meta Quest 2 has been sold out everywhere since July, so this announcement isn’t a surprise – it already happened. It’s sad, but with the 3S here, there’s no reason to pick up a Quest 2, frankly. It was fantastic, and I loved it, but it’s time for the next generation of XR hardware. The Meta Quest Pro has been hanging on, but its demise shouldn’t be a shocker. It’s never a good sign when a product drops one-third of its price in just six months on sale, and since the Quest 3 launch – a way cheaper headset that even performs better in a few key areas – the Quest Pro has very much faded into the background. Meta says these devices will still be on sale until the end of the year or until its remaining stock runs dry – whichever comes first. So if you want one for your collection, act fast, but if I were you, I’d pay attention to a different Quest that’s being killed off. My favorite of the trio: the Meta Quest 3 128GB. As leakers reported the day before Meta Connect, the Quest 3 128GB model is also being discontinued. The 512GB Meta Quest 3 will remain on sale, however, at a reduced price of $499.99 / £469.99 / AU$1,049.99. From now until the stock runs out, the 128GB Meta Quest 3 will be on sale for $429.99 / £409.99 / AU$799.99, and it looks like this could be the best headset to buy right now as it has all the upgrades of the full-Quest 3 while still being fairly affordable. Plus, given that VR games and apps aren’t big files 128GB is more than enough – especially as it’s so easy to delete and later redownload titles if you run out of storage. The only downside of this deal is you’ll miss out on the Batman: Arkham Shadow purchase bonus included with the Meta Quest 3S models and 512GB Meta Quest 3. This is a slight incentive to opt for the 512GB model instead, but even if you buy it separately the Meta Quest 3 128GB model is still a solid deal.

Title: Meta discontinues Quest 2 and Quest Pro | TechCrunch

Comment Hidden among the Meta Connect 2024 hardware announcements comes word that the social media giant is sunsetting two key members of its Quest VR headset line. With the budget Quest 3S now up for preorder, Meta will no longer sell the Quest 2 and Quest Pro once back stock is deleted. The end of the Quest 2 isn’t surprising. The headset is long in the tooth, celebrating its fourth birthday in October. Meta kept the legacy device on sale as a way to offer a cheaper alternative to the Quest 3. The new Quest 3S, however, now occupies its place in the lineup with its $300 starting price. It also shares some key characteristics with the new 3S model, including display resolution. The Quest Pro, on the other hand, debuted in 2022 as Meta’s bid to offer up its mixed reality for enterprise. The truth is, however, that last year’s Quest 3 made the Pro model largely redundant, and did so at a lower price point. Here’s what Meta has to say on the matter: “[Y]ou know what they say about new beginnings. With Quest 3S on the shelf, we’re officially winding down sales of Quest 2 and Pro. We’ll be selling our remaining headsets through the end of the year or until they’re gone, whichever comes first. If you’d like a carrying case, the Touch Pro controllers, the Quest 2 Active Pack, or any of the other accessories for Quest 2 and Pro, we plan to continue selling those for a bit longer.” Notably, Meta is also ending security patch updates for the original Quest headset in September.

Say goodbye to the 128GB version of Quest 3, as the company is slated to only offer the 512GB version moving forward, and at a new, more attractive price. With the entrance of Quest 3S, and the discontinuation of Quest 2 and Quest Pro, Meta’s lineup is shifting a bit to make way for its new entry level XR headset, Quest 3S. Released in late 2023 for $650, the 512GB version of Quest 3 is still the company’s best-in-class headset. But now Quest 3 (512GB) is is dropping to just $500. Meanwhile, Quest 3 (128GB), which was originally $500, is being phased out. Meta is pricing Quest 3 (128GB) at $430 until supply is gone. Although the Quest 3 (128GB) price cut isn’t massive, it’s certainly not something to sneeze at if you absolutely need a great XR headset today and don’t want to go down a half-step with Quest 3S, which is being offered starting at $300 for the 128GB version and $400 for the 256GB version. Quest 3S is slated to launch on October 15th, offering the same resolution and Fresnel optics as Quest 2, but with the same Qualcomm Snapdragon XR gen 2 chipset as of Quest 3.

I think 10/15/2024, when the 3s is released. Prices already lowered in UK. Funny, I'm over here still rocking a 64GB Quest 2 and they didn't even list it LOL. I may have to grab that 128GB Quest 3S though. Looks nice. If it will run the new Batman game coming out, I'm all on board…. same, still rocking Q2 thats been extensive abuse from a toddler for years, still functions great

Title: Quest 2 and Quest Pro are Being Discontinued, Encouraging Wider Adoption of Mixed Reality

Out with the old, in with the new. Meta announced that the cheap and cheerful Quest 2 and the company’s pricey mixed reality pioneer Quest Pro are officially getting the boot, marking Meta’s next big push to bring mixed reality to the masses. There aren’t any official figures going around, but it’s safe to say Quest 2 was Meta’s most popular VR headset to date, coming just one year after the launch of the original Quest, which was released in May 2019. Still, even nearly three years after release, Quest 2 was so popular last Holiday season it handily outsold Quest 3 on Amazon. While it’s impossible to say whether Quest 3S will live up to Quest 2’s legacy, at an aggressive $300 price point for the entry-level 128GB model, it has a pretty good chance of again attracting plenty of eyeballs when it launches October 15th. So much can’t be said for Quest Pro, which always felt more like an expensive mixed reality dev kit than a consumer device, launching in 2022 for an eye-watering $1,500. Granted, Meta relented somewhat, bringing it down to $1,000 nearly a year after launch, likely owing to its overly exclusionary price point and lack of compelling MR content—something Meta hopes to deliver on starting with Quest 3S. That said, we’re unlikely to recommend Quest Pro over Quest 3 or Quest 3S due to the upcoming slate of Quest 3-exclusive content that notably doesn’t support Quest Pro. And with that, Meta is now officially winding down sales of Quest 2 and Quest Pro. Remaining stock will be sold through the end of the year or until they’re gone, whichever comes first, Meta says. Accessories for both are still going to be on offer, such as carrying cases, Touch Pro controllers, Quest 2 Active Pack, or any of the other accessories for Quest 2 and Pro, with Meta noting it will to continue selling those “for a bit longer” after Quest 2 and QUest Pro headset supplies dry up. So, out with the old, in the with the new. Check out our hands-on with Quest 3S to get the full details on just why Meta thinks you might want its next XR headset.

Title: The Biggest Supreme Court Cases to Watch This Term
URL: https://time.com/7024317/supreme-court-term-cases-2024/
Time Published: 2024-09-25T15:42:28Z

The U.S. Supreme Court returns to the bench on Oct. 7 to start a new term that includes cases on transgender rights, guns, pornography, flavored vapes, and more. In the coming months, the court will hear a case that will examine the constitutionality of state bans on medical treatments for transgender minors. It will hear two others that could radically reshape regulations on ghost guns and redefine corporate accountability in the tech industry. And it may confront urgent election-related litigation after Nov. 5 that tests the limits of the Electoral Count Act, depending on the aftermath of the presidential election. The new term begins as the Supreme Court is grappling with significant internal challenges and public scrutiny, as concerns about undisclosed gifts to certain Justices and ideologically divided decisions on some of the nation’s most divisive issues has raised questions about transparency and impartiality within the institution. A July 2024 survey from the Pew Research Center found that 47% of Americans express a favorable opinion of the court following a consequential term, in which it granted presidents broad criminal immunity for some actions in office, preserved access to an abortion pill, and upheld a law that prevents those under a restraining order for domestic violence from possessing guns. Here are some of the key cases coming up this term. Perhaps the highest-profile case already on the docket, United States v. Skrmetti could have significant implications for transgender rights across the country. The case focuses on a Tennessee law that prohibits certain medical treatments for transgender minors, including puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and gender-transition surgeries. The case marks the first time the Justices will weigh in on the constitutionality of statewide bans of this nature, which have proliferated in approximately two dozen Republican-led states in recent years. The Tennessee law, known as SB1, has already stirred considerable controversy, with the Biden Administration and various advocacy groups arguing that it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar has contended that the law discriminates against transgender individuals by allowing these medical interventions for other medical conditions while categorically banning them for gender dysphoria. Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti defends the law as a necessary measure to protect minors from potentially irreversible treatments that may be based on "uncertain" benefits. The Supreme Court’s decision to hear the case comes at a time of increasing legal fragmentation regarding transgender healthcare, with different federal courts issuing conflicting rulings. Legal analysts suggest that the Supreme Court’s ruling could establish a landmark precedent not only on transgender medical care but also on broader issues of civil rights, including access to public facilities and participation in sports. In Garland v. VanDerStok, the Justices will hear a case that challenges the Biden Administration’s regulation of ghost guns—untraceable firearms that can be assembled from kits and lack serial numbers. The case represents a critical moment in the ongoing debate over gun control, as the regulation was designed to combat the increasing prevalence of these weapons in crime scenes across the country. The rule, implemented in 2022 by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), expands the definition of a firearm under the Gun Control Act of 1968. It mandates that unfinished parts, such as gun frames and receivers, must be serialized and licensed, ensuring that they can be traced. The regulation also requires background checks for the sale of these components. However, it has faced pushback from gun owners and manufacturers, who argue that it overreaches the authority granted to the ATF and violates the original intent of federal firearm laws. A federal appeals court upheld a lower court’s decision to strike down the regulation. U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor contended that the definition of a firearm does not encompass kits and parts, arguing that such interpretations should be the purview of Congress, not the judiciary. The ruling raised alarms among some law enforcement and advocacy groups, which fear that a Supreme Court decision against the regulation could lead to an influx of ghost guns, complicating efforts to address gun violence. The Supreme Court is set to determine the legality of a Texas law mandating age verification for users of pornographic websites. The case, Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton, could have significant implications for First Amendment rights, as the state law, enacted in June 2023, aims to restrict minors from accessing sexually explicit content by requiring users to provide personal information for age verification. Proponents of the law, including Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, argue that it is necessary to protect minors from exposure to harmful material. They assert that requiring age verification ensures that only adults can access pornography, thus addressing a pressing public safety concern. However, critics, including the Free Speech Coalition, contend that the law infringes upon the constitutional rights of adults, creating a chilling effect on access to protected speech. They argue that the measure is overbroad and fails to account for the privacy risks associated with submitting personal information online. Read More: How an Ordained Rabbi Ended Up Owning the World’s Most Famous Porn Company A federal district judge initially blocked the law, citing concerns that it imposes unnecessary restrictions on adult access to constitutionally protected material. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals later permitted the law to take effect, ruling that the age verification requirement is rationally related to the state's legitimate interest in preventing minors from accessing pornography. However, dissenting opinions within the panel highlighted the law's potential to limit access to protected speech for adults, raising questions about its constitutionality. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear FDA v. Wages and White Lion Investments, a case that will evaluate the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) decision to deny marketing authorization for flavored e-cigarettes produced by Triton Distribution. The case comes amid ongoing concerns about the popularity of vaping among young people and the agency's efforts to regulate products that might appeal to minors. At the heart of the dispute is the FDA's rejection of applications for sweet-flavored e-liquids, including varieties such as "Jimmy The Juice Man Peachy Strawberry" and "Killer Kustard Blueberry." The agency contends that these products pose a "serious, well-documented risk" of enticing young users, contributing to alarming rates of e-cigarette use among adolescents. In 2020, nearly 20% of high school students reported using e-cigarettes, with flavored options being the overwhelming choice, the FDA said in court documents. They have argued that companies failed to demonstrate that the benefits of their products for adult smokers outweighed the risks of underage consumption. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals previously sided with Triton, declaring that the FDA had acted in an "arbitrary and capricious" manner by imposing new requirements for studies on smoking cessation that had not been communicated prior to the companies’ applications. The implications of the case could extend beyond flavored e-cigarettes. The court's decision may clarify the FDA's authority under the Tobacco Control Act of 2009, which mandates that new tobacco products be proven “appropriate for the protection of the public health.” The Justices will hear Meta’s appeal in a high-stakes class action lawsuit related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which has drawn significant scrutiny over the misuse of user data. The high court will review a decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that allowed the lawsuit, spearheaded by Amalgamated Bank on behalf of shareholders, to proceed. Investors allege that Meta misled them about the risks associated with Facebook user data being improperly accessed by Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that worked for Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. The lawsuit claims that inadequate disclosures led to substantial drops in Meta’s stock price in 2018, following revelations that the personal information of approximately 87 million Facebook users had been exploited without consent. The litigation, initiated in 2018, accuses Meta and its executives of violating the Securities Exchange Act by making false statements regarding data security risks that had already materialized. In its defense, Meta argues that the 9th Circuit's ruling sets a troubling precedent that could require public companies to disclose historical incidents that do not pose current risks. Meta has already faced penalties, including a $5 billion fine and a $725 million settlement related to user privacy violations. In NVIDIA v. E. Ohman J, the Supreme Court will consider a case that challenges the Ninth Circuit’s interpretation of fraudulent intent in shareholder class action lawsuits. The core of the dispute revolves around allegations that Nvidia misrepresented its dependence on the volatile cryptocurrency mining market, leading to significant financial losses for investors. Shareholders claim that the company’s CEO made misleading statements about demand for its products, failing to disclose crucial information that could indicate a risk of mismanagement. At the heart of the case is the legal standard for establishing "scienter," or the intent to deceive, which requires plaintiffs to present specific facts demonstrating that a defendant acted with knowledge or reckless disregard. Nvidia, whose computer chips the world relies on to make AI systems, argues that the Ninth Circuit improperly accepted vague allegations from unnamed former employees and speculative analyses from hired experts, rather than concrete evidence of fraudulent intent. The company contends that such reliance on speculation undermines the stringent requirements set forth in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. A ruling in favor of Nvidia could reinforce higher standards for investor claims and potentially reduce the number of frivolous lawsuits, while a decision that supports the Ninth Circuit's stance might embolden shareholders to pursue more claims based on less concrete evidence, experts say.

Title: Things are looking up for the economy. So why are consumers still unhappy?

Good morning! I've been known to make a bet or two in my day, which is why I'm wondering the odds you could get betting you'd have four kids with the same birthday. In today's big story, the economy is heading in the right direction, but consumers aren't buying it. What's on deck: But first, the vibes are all off. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates, the stock market reached all-time highs, and the risk of a recession is gone. Things seem to be going really well for the economy, right? Wrong. Consumers aren't feeling bullish about the economy these days. In fact, they're quite pessimistic. US consumer confidence suffered its biggest drop in three years this month, according to data from the Conference Board. We've been here before. For much of 2022 and 2023, Americans were in a "vibecession" where their perception of the economy was much worse than the data indicated. Last time around, pesky inflation was keeping things like groceries and housing costs high, even as the rest of the economy showed improvement. This time, the labor market's the culprit, writes Business Insider's Juliana Kaplan. But it's not mass layoffs most people are worried about. Having a job isn't the issue — the unemployment rate is just 4.2% — as much as finding the next gig. It's no wonder that consumers aged 35 to 54 suffered the biggest drop in confidence, according to the Conference Board. This group, which is in its prime earning years, is facing a job market that's keeping them stuck in place. The labor market isn't a lost cause, though. The Fed has acknowledged its top priority is keeping an eye on job growth and unemployment. We'll get a sense of which direction things are headed on October 4 when we get September's payroll data. Morgan Stanley's chief US equity strategist, Mike Wilson, recently outlined the best- and worst-case scenarios for the numbers in regard to the stock market. If unemployment dips below 4.1% and non-farm payroll can surpass 150,000, consider it game on for a big fourth quarter for stocks. But if unemployment climbs to 4.3% and non-farm payroll drops below 100,000, buckle up for a bumpy ride. The stock market isn't representative of the entire economy, as we've already covered. But continued success there could give companies more confidence to start hiring again. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.
