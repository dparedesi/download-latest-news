Title: Tesla Hits $1 Trillion Market Cap—Musk Becomes $300 Billion Man After Trump Win

Friends Read Free Shares of Tesla Motors rallied 9 percent to end the trading week, pushing the company’s value to $1 trillion for the first time since April 2022. The electric vehicle (EV) maker’s stock reached $325 on the Nasdaq Composite Index during the Nov. 8 trading session. Before Election Day, Tesla maintained a market cap of about $807 billion, and shares were up just 1 percent for the year. The company rejoins the growing club of trillion-dollar companies, including Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia. Tesla first ventured past the $1 trillion threshold in October 2021. Due to the stock’s significant gains, Elon Musk’s net worth surged to $300 billion for the first time in more than two years. Tesla’s stock rocketed by 33 percent this week, adding approximately $200 billion in value as investors cheered President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House. Since billionaire Elon Musk was a critical ally for Trump during the 2024 campaign, traders are betting that a second term for the Republican could benefit the automaker. Musk’s pro-Trump America PAC received approximately $118 million from the billionaire. Musk appeared alongside the president-elect at several rallies in the final days of the presidential election, hosted a tour across the key battleground state of Pennsylvania, and was also at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate on election night. Trump has provided mixed views on electric automobiles. “I’m for electric cars. I have to be because Elon endorsed me very strongly,” Trump told a crowd of supporters in August at a rally in Atlanta. Trump later revealed he may consider ending a $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases. In March, Trump stated that the U.S. automotive industry could suffer a “bloodbath” partly because of the current administration’s green energy policies. President Joe Biden’s landmark legislation maintains a plethora of EV incentives to accelerate the transition from gas-powered automobiles to new energy vehicles. Still, Tesla could benefit under a Trump administration and provide the company with a competitive advantage, says Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. “Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry, and this dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment, coupled with likely higher China tariffs that would continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players,” Ives said in a note. Seth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar Research, says any changes to EV subsidies could affect domestic sales of electric cars. The stock has trended upward in the second half following a lackluster first half. Shares soared last month after the company’s upbeat third-quarter earnings report. Tesla topped Wall Street forecasts in the third quarter and registered better-than-expected profits. In the earnings call, Musk also revealed that his “best guess” is that vehicle growth will reach 20 to 30 percent in 2025 amid “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.” Musk noted that he would help speed up the federal approval process for autonomous vehicles. “But just like some things in the U.S. are state-by-state regulated like, for example, insurance, like incredibly to do it state by state for 50 states. And, I think we should have this national approval process for autonomy.” Bank of America raised its target to “Buy” and forecasts a 17 percent upside to $350 from the previous estimate of $265. The first half of 2024, says Goldstein, was “likely the bottom” for the company. “In our view, the results signal that the first half of 2024 was likely the bottom for Tesla’s automotive gross profits, as we expect fourth-quarter results will also exceed 20%,” Goldstein said in an Oct. 24 note.

Title: Donald Trump won the election. What happens to Trump Media now?

When Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT+15.04%) debuted on the Nasdaq (NDAQ+0.70%) in late March, Donald Trump had long since announced plans to launch his third bid for the White House. His election win now begs the question: What will happen to the company that counts the now president-elect as its biggest shareholder? Trump helped found Trump Media in 2021 with the launch his own social media platform, Truth Social, after being banned from X (META-0.41%) (formerly Twitter) in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. X owner and staunch Trump ally Elon Musk reinstated Trump’s X account in November 2022, one month after buying the platform. Trump Media went public on March 26 under the ticker DJT, after completing its merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC) (DWAC), a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. Now that Trump will be returning to the White House in January, his more than 100 million shares are a focal point. In a post on Truth Social Friday, Trump said that rumors allegedly coming from “market manipulators or short sellers” suggesting that he’s considering selling his stake in the company are “fake, untrue, and probably illegal.” “Truth is an important part of our historic win, and I deeply believe in it,” he said. Although he stands to gain from a sale, it would be difficult to carry out without tanking the value of the stock. Earlier this year, Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes repeatedly called on Congress to investigate manipulation and illegal short-selling of DJT stock. From an ethics standpoint, it’s a little muddy. While Trump, who is the primary shareholder of Trump Media with a 57.6% stake in the company, can legally hold onto his shares while in office, there is a conflict of interest. As president, Trump has direct oversight of government agencies that oversee the company, including the Federal Communications Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. “It’s a clear conflict of interest for the president of the United States to perform those executive functions while owning a substantial stake in a media company, whether it’s social media or any other,” Richard Painter, a former chief White House ethics lawyer, told Straight Arrow News. In practice, however, vice president of research at Morningstar (MORN+1.54%) John Rekenthaler said in an interview that he doesn’t think it will be an issue. “I don’t think with his presidency that voters or federal, national legislators will pursue that,” he said. The symbiotic relationship between Trump and Trump Media raises red flags for investors. The company itself has acknowledged in regulatory filings that its success depends in part on Trump’s popularity and reputation. In the six weeks leading up to Election Day, “pre-election euphoria” drove the stock nearly 200% higher as Trump’s odds of winning increased. Even before the election, DJT was what Rekenthaler calls an “affinity stock,” trading on emotions and fanaticism for the president elect rather than on actual business performance. The company reported yet another quarterly loss in its third-quarter earnings on Tuesday — also Election Day. In the three months ended Sept. 30, Trump Media lost $19.2 million, with revenue falling 5.6% to just $1.01 million from a year earlier. Given his outsized stake in the company, DJT stock performance also drives much of Trump’s own wealth. As of Friday, the company had a market capitalization of $6.53 billion. At a price per share of around $32, Trump’s net worth stemming from his holdings in the company is in the ballpark of almost $4 billion. Shares have been especially volatile around the election, with the stock closing down nearly 23% Thursday before popping back up 18% in Friday afternoon trading. Rekenthaler said that it’s possible the pre-election rally was an election trade, rather than a long-term investment. That might explain some of the volatility in recent days, particularly the losses on the day after Trump’s election victory. “There is the adage that you sell on the good news,” Rekenthaler said. “Maybe some people sold on the good news after the election.” When it comes to what the stock will do once Trump returns to the Oval Office, it’s anybody’s guess, according to Rekenthaler. “No idea,” he said. “To the extent that I had an idea, that idea disappeared the day after the election.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Tesla just hit a $1 trillion market cap as Trump's win powers a stock surge

Tesla’s (TSLA+8.11%) market capitalization hit $1 trillion Friday morning, as Donald Trump’s election win has helped the EV maker’s stock surge this week. The company’s share price rose more than 6% to about $313 during intraday trading on Friday. It marks the first time Tesla stock has risen above $300 per share since September 2022. The EV giant is now the ninth largest company in the world by market cap. Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s alliance with Trump appears to be paying off, potentially giving Tesla a significant advantage under the new administration — including some influence on the regulation of driverless vehicles, while at the same time putting its competitors at a disadvantage. This includes possible influence over regulations covering self-driving vehicles. Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, highlighted that Tesla stock surged 44% over the past 12 trading days, far outpacing the Nasdaq’s 4% gain during the same period. “This is more than just a meme stock,” Munster wrote in a post Friday on X, the social media company owned by Musk. “The accelerating delivery growth next year (flat-ish in 2024 and up +20% in 2025) and the long-term opportunity around autonomy will power the fundamentals that should lead to further price appreciation.” In a post earlier this week, Munster wrote that Tesla’s surge in recent days is broadly “based on emotion, that emotion is Elon made a big bet and was right. This gives investors confidence that his next big bet has a greater potential to succeed. His next big bet is autonomy.” Musk has become a close ally of Trump’s over the past several months, even spending election night with him at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Earlier this year, Musk founded and donated at least $80 million to a super PAC that supported Trump’s campaign. And Musk, who also leads several other firms including SpaceX, is now poised to have some level of role or influence in the upcoming Trump administration. Musk has agreed to lead what he and Trump call a Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a commission that would conduct a “complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government” and recommend reforms. Musk has said he would cut “at least” $2 trillion from federal spending, which is likely a difficult task given that the federal government has spent $6.75 trillion in fiscal year 2024. As part of that job, Musk said he would advocate for a national approach to regulating driverless vehicles — a key market for Tesla — and cut overregulation, which he has repeatedly criticized as holding his companies back. SpaceX, Neuralink, X (META-0.41%), and Tesla are collectively the subject of at least 20 recent investigations or reviews. But whatever his exact role might be in the administration remains unclear. Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, who is helping lead Trump’s transition team, said before Election Day that Musk would work “adjacent” to the government and be “writing software” to help the government cut back spending. That would likely allow Musk to continue leading his companies without divesting, as he would have to do if he took an official role. While Trump’s victory is good for Tesla, it’s expected to be less friendly to other automakers with EV plans. He’s expected to freeze provisions of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which provided $7,500 tax credits for American-made EVs. Musk has supported ending the tax credit, believing it would help Tesla sales while slamming rivals. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Tesla returned to the $1 trillion club Friday, after its stock surged in the days following Donald Trump's presidential election victory. Shares in the electric automaker have soared approximately 23% since Wednesday — a sharp turnaround from a year in which its stock price had otherwise been moving sideways. The new valuation also increases Tesla CEO Elon Musk's net worth to some $300 billion, according to Forbes — increasing his net worth as the world's richest person by more than $30 billion. Musk campaigned aggressively for Trump, who has signaled he intends to appoint the Tesla chief to a role tasked with increasing government "efficiency" that would cut programs deemed wasteful. Through his rocket company SpaceX, Musk has been the beneficiary of billions in government contracts over the past decade. While Tesla has fewer direct contracts, it has been embroiled in multiple federal investigations and regulatory actions that could be dialed back once Trump takes office. Tesla's 13-figure valuation puts it among the ranks of Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Google-parent Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook-parent Meta. Tesla previously hit $1 trillion in 2021. Demand for Tesla's electric vehicles has shown some signs of weakness in recent quarters, but Musk has said he is staking the automaker's future not on environmentally conscious drivers but rather on a future fleet of autonomous vehicles. On that front, the company now faces competition from Alphabet-owned Waymo, which has already been steadily rolling out "robotaxi" services in several markets.

Globally, over 81 million people use e-cigarettes, and the majority of them are young adults. Using e-cigarettes causes different types of adverse health effects both in adults and elderly people. Over time, using e-cigarettes has detrimental consequences on lung function, brain development and numerous other illnesses. This study employed a mixed-methods conducted between June and September 2023, comprising two phases: Geographical Information System (GIS) mapping of available e-cigarette point-of-sale (POS) locations and conducting 15 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with e-cigarette retailers, along with 5 key informant interviews (KIIs) involving tobacco control activists and policy experts. ArcGIS was employed for spatial analysis, creating distribution and type maps, and buffer and multi-buffer ring analyses were conducted to assess proximity to hospitals and academic institutions. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics for GIS mapping and qualitative analysis for interview transcripts, utilizing a priori codebook and thematic analysis. A total of 276 POS were mapped in the entire Dhaka city. About 55 POS were found within 100m distance from academic institutions in Dhaka city, which offers the easy accessibility of young generations to e-cigarettes. The younger generation is becoming the major target for e-cigarettes because of their alluring flavors, appealing looks, and variation in flavors. Sellers have been using different marketing tactics such as postering, offering discounts and using internet marketing on social media. Moreover, they try to convince the customers by saying that e-cigarettes are ‘not harmful’ or ‘less harmful’. However, retailers were mostly taking e-cigarettes from local wholesalers or distributors. Customers buy these products both from in-store and online services. Due to the absence of laws and regulations on e-cigarettes in Bangladesh, the availability, marketing, and selling of e-cigarettes are increasing alarmingly. E-cigarette retail shops are mostly surrounded by academic institutions, and it is expanding. Besides, frequent exposure, easy accessibility, and tactful promotion encourage the younger generations to consume e-cigarettes. The government should take necessary control measures on manufacturing, storage, advertising, promotion, sponsorship, marketing, distribution, sale, import, and export in order to safeguard the health and safety of young and future generations.

These battery-powered devices operate by heating a mixture of propylene glycol, glycerin, and water with a variety of flavors [2]. From 2011 to 2018, there was a significant increase in the number of e-cigarette users, rising from approximately 7 million to 41 million. This shift made a great impact on consumption pattern and brought about a new era of tobacco consumption [3]. However, despite becoming increasingly popular, e-cigarettes pose serious threats to public health. Initially hailed as safer alternatives to conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes introduce a novel source of nicotine, a highly addictive substance with so many adverse health effects [4–6]. Additionally, the World Health Organization has reported that e-cigarettes are harmful to health [7]. The heated liquid in the e-cigarette produces an aerosol of small particles that are absorbed by the lungs, quickly passing through the heart, and providing nicotine to the brain [8]. Even the regular use of e-cigarettes has been associated with deaths [9]. Notably, most e-cigarette users are former smokers or dual users, consuming traditional tobacco products, while a smaller group of people who have never smoked [10]. Although e-cigarettes have become increasingly popular among youth and young adults, but its consumption remained low among older adults. The jobless and manual laborers have the highest prevalence of e-cigarette usage, and men are more likely than women to use them [11]. It has found that about 700,000 middle and high school students are vaping every single day [12].Several research papers have depicted the reason why people are more likely to consume e-cigarettes. According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),teens who vape may become addicted to nicotine faster than teens who smoke cigarettes, leading to increased vaping frequency and duration, putting them at risk for nicotine addiction [13]. As a result, most of the customers (91%) reported enjoying vaping more than smoking, with 80% preferring non-tobacco e-cigarette flavors. In total, there were nearly 270 different e-cigarette brands available as of December 2022, an increase of 46.2% from January 2020 [14]. A more recent analysis found that these brands offer over 9,000 different devices, which has tripled since 2020 [15]. Researchers also identified more than 15,500 unique e-cigarette flavors available online in 2007 [16]. Among youth users of flavored e-cigarettes, the most commonly used flavor types were fruit (69.1%), candy/desserts/other sweets (38.3%), mint (29.4%) and menthol (26.6%) [12]. An experimental study found that adolescents who were exposed to displays predominantly comprising tobacco products were more willing to use e-cigarettes in the future, compared with those were not exposed to the displays [17]. Moreover, the effects of both e-cigarette retail display visibility, and the availability (both relative and absolute) of products such as food and alcohol and, by extension their visibility, is one of the key factor to change behaviors [18, 19]. According to a another study, the convincing pitches in advertisements greatly influence customer reactions to e-cigarette marketing and their behaviors and actions [20]. E-cigarette advertisements differ from traditional cigarette ads because they often portray their products as healthier alternatives to cigarettes, which can be used as solutions to help people quit smoking [20–23]. A review of various research articles shows that young people in developed countries like Europe and America are more attracted towards online exposure to e-cigarette retail displays on [24, 25]. According to a study, More than 40% of online e-cigarette vendors use loyalty programs, special discounts, and promotional coupons to attract new clients [26]. They also frequently utilize social media to distribute promotional deals, with an average of 2.6 different social media platforms used per seller website [26]. In the U.S., a large proportion of e-cigarettes in the market are imported, with nearly 100% coming from China between 2016 and 2018 [27]. In Australia, there are two possible ways to obtain an e-cigarette: the first is through a pharmacy, and the second is by using the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) personal importation system to import up to three months’ worth of stock [28]. The legal status of e-cigarettes is currently pending in many countries [29]. Many countries such as Brazil, Singapore, Uruguay [30] and India have banned e-cigarettes [31]. The US Food and Drug Administration has issued some regulations for e-cigarettes, including supervision, a minimum buying age of 18 years, premarket approval applications, warning signs, and displaying the list of harmful ingredients [32]. The Government of Bangladesh (GoB) has now banned conventional smoking in specific public places and on public transport. There are also implemented some regulations for packaging and advertising of these tobacco products [33]. This law significantly reduces the prevalence of smoking and tobacco use among the population. In contrast, there has no laws and regulations regarding the prohibition of the use, selling, promotion, or advertising of e-cigarettes in Bangladesh [34, 35]. To achieve good health and wellbeing (SDG goal 3), we have to strengthen the effort on Tobacco Control by 2030 [36]. Bangladesh government has targeted to achieve tobacco free Bangladesh by 2040. As a developing country, However, Bangladesh currently lack of evidence regarding distribution, marketing, and policy initiatives of e-cigarettes. Additionally, the regulation of e-cigarettes in Dhaka and Bangladesh remains relatively underdeveloped, emphasizing a critical gap in the country’s approach to tobacco control. Thus, this study helps to bridge these gaps by exploring the perception, distribution, availability, planning and banning scenario of e-cigarettes in the retail market of Dhaka, the center of Bangladesh. The aim of this study to provide scientific evidence that can inform future regulatory efforts and enforcing law. This was a qualitative study conducted between June and September 2023. Moreover, this study has been divided into two phases regarding data collection. The first phase generated data concerning Geographical Information System (GIS) mapping of the point of sale (POS) of e-cigarettes, and the second phase included in-depth interviews (IDIs) with e-cigarette retailers as well as key informant interviews (KIIs) with anti-tobacco activists and policymakers at both Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) and Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) in Bangladesh, which is also one of the world’s largest and most densely populated cities [37]. In this study, the participants for in-depth interviews (IDIs) were such as e-cigarette vendors who were directly or indirectly involved in e-cigarette distribution, and the participants for the key informant interview (KII) were such as anti-tobacco activists of Dhaka city. Most of the literature advises measuring purposeful sample sizes inductively and keeping sampling until saturation. A total of 20 people were invited to participate in the interview including fifteen participants for IDI and five anti-tobacco activists for KII. However, we got our saturation level before finishing the 20 interviews. The inclusion criteria of the participants were being Bangladeshi citizens and residents, handling e-cigarettes, and ability to talk. On the contrary, the exclusion criteria were including not living in Bangladesh, being a resident without Bangladeshi, do not handling e-cigarette, not willing to participate in the study. Before each of the interviews, the participants were informed about the aim and objectives of the study, if they gave permission then interviews were conducted by the moderators. This study used purposive sampling techniques to the interviewees. The current study purposefully collected data from various participant settings (e.g., street e-cigarette shops, residential e-cigarette shops, hybrid e-cigarette shops, dedicated e-cigarette shops etc.) to ensure the strength of the data. For GIS mapping, all e-cigarette outlets in the study area and their GPS coordinates were recorded. Stores that sold any kind of e-cigarette were considered as point of sales (POS). E-cigarette outlet coordinates were collected by six pairs of trained enumerators after attending 3 days of training session. The enumerators determined the e-cigarette outlet by looking for e-cigarette displays, seeing the purchase of e-cigarettes, or approaching the retailer personally in cases when none of these were apparent. The enumerators completed an electronic checklist on Kobo Toolbox embedded in their mobile phone. It included POS ID, name of POS, type of POS, GPS coordinates of e-cigarette shops and selling points, advertisements placed in the shop, and any institutions located near 100m and 500m within the shop. In this section, this study analyzed the distribution of e-cigarette shops, and types of shops, and assessed their proximity to academic institutions and hospitals. The collected GPS points are extracted from Kobo Toolbox and imported into GIS software, specifically ArcGIS for spatial analysis. For GIS mapping, this study used ArcGIS Pro software by ESRI (licensed version) and the scale is 1:100000. The POS location points collected from fields are plotted in the GIS attribute for mapping and showing the distribution of those POS. All the GIS maps are solely developed by the author. The output maps are produced using projected coordinate system of UTM (Zone 45N). In the GIS environment, firstly a distribution map of e-cigarette shops across Dhaka City was formed, encompassing both the North and South City Corporation areas. This map visually represents the spatial dispersion of e-cigarette shops. Additionally, a secondary map is generated to categorize the several types of e-cigarette shops. This provides essential information on the specific classifications or categories of e-cigarette shops present within the study area. Moving forward, a buffer analysis is undertaken to ascertain the distribution of e-cigarette shops within a defined radius of hospitals. In this case, a buffer zone of 100 meters is established around hospital locations to identify which e-cigarette shops fall within this designated zone. To further assess the proximity of academic institutions to e-cigarette shops, a multi-buffer ring analysis was conducted to determine the presence of academic institutions within specified distances, such as 100 meters and 500 meters, from e-cigarette shops. Multiple buffer zones were created around the e-cigarette shop locations to facilitate this evaluation. The qualitative interview guideline was formed through the analysis of pertinent and significant literature, and pre-testing was carried out before of the data collection. Through the use of an open-ended questionnaire, data were gathered based on the respondents’ convenience. Before of the interview, brief descriptions of the study’s background, objectives, eligibility requirements, confidentiality, anonymity, and informed consent of each responder were provided and explained pleasantly to the interviewees and attached also in the first page of the guideline. The IDI guideline was formed, including questions such as perceptions regarding e-cigarettes, the e-cigarette distribution process, marketing strategies concerning e-cigarette distribution, and so on. In addition, the KII guideline was also formed based on perceptions about e-cigarettes, the import mechanism of e-cigarettes and how to reduce the importation of e-cigarettes, the concept of distribution and marketing strategy of e-cigarettes, if there is any support for reducing/banning e-cigarette use in Bangladesh, and so on. Prior to the interview, each respondent was provided full informed consent and made sure that the participants understood the reasons for inviting, the risks, privacy, anonymity, and confidentiality, as well as their right to withdraw and not participate. In the interview, we also ensured that they were under no obligation to continue and might end at any time. Interviewers made an effort to find a location with the fewest disruptions. Most of the interviews were around 45 min, and the audio was recorded to ensure validity. Additionally, we got their permission to record the interview on audio. The field notes were also taken to address any extra essential information. To facilitate the exploration of the inner meaning and uncover the phenomenon under investigation, data were gathered in the native language of the respondents. To maintain the anonymity of each respondent, we assigned ID numbers to them. The interviews had to be transcribed verbatim, coded, and summarized by the proficient native Bengali data enumerators. Finally, no incentives were provided to study participants to encourage their participation. This study created geographical maps with ArcGIS Pro software by ESRI. Descriptive statistics (frequency and percentage) were computed to find out the proportion of POS in each city corporation and the percentage of POS types. On the other hand, transcripts of the interviews were read and reviewed carefully, coded under different themes, and finally were analyzed by narrative review method. To ensure accuracy, the transcripts and audio recordings were cross-checked for any inconsistencies. A priori codebook was used, which was developed through reviewing relevant literature and the thematic analysis was performed following the themes identifying techniques [38], where texts were extracted and summarized through manual coding. Finally, to explain the results, the data were methodically indexed, synthesized, and evaluated. The interviews were conducted in accordance with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration, and the highest ethical standards were maintained throughout the study. Ethical permission was obtained from the institutional review board (IRB), ‘Biosafety, Biosecurity & Ethical Committee’ (Ref No: BBEC, JU/M 2023/05 (30)) of the Jahangirnagar University, Savar, Dhaka. Furthermore, individual informed consent was taken from all participants who read/understood the purpose of the study before data collection. We found a total of 276 e-cigarette shops in Dhaka City, among them the majority (56.5%) were in Dhaka North City Corporation followed by Dhaka South City Corporation (43.5%). Among the POS in both South and North city corporations, the highest POS type was watch or sunglass shops (26.8%) followed by dedicated vape shops (26.4%), cigarette shops (17.4%), and cosmetics shops (12.7%), electronics shops (4%) etc. (Table 1). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312802.t001 The bar graph illustrates the percentage of POS distribution based on City Corporation. In DSCC, the highest percentage POS type was watches and sunglasses shops (40%) followed by dedicated vape shops (20.8%), cigarette shops (18.3%). On the other hand, in DNCC majority was dedicated vape shops (30.8%), while the same proportion of watch/sunglass and cigarettes shops were noticed at 16.7% (Fig 1). The distribution of several institutions is presented in Table 2. The bar graph illustrates the percentage of POS distribution based on City Corporation.

It is observed that most of the POS located at shopping malls in both city corporations, whereas 55.0% in DSCC and 37.8% in DNCC followed by 5.1% (DNCC) and 2.5% (DSCC) in residential house, 3.8% (DNCC) and 0.8% (DSCC) in super shop (Fig 2). Moreover, advertisements related information has been depicted in Fig 3. In Table 2 presents the diverse types of institutions found within 100 meters of different POSs according to observation. Highest 39 (48.1%) colleges, 36 (44.4%) high schools and 15 (18.5%) hospitals were found within 100 meters of different POS locations. We got only one kindergarten within 100 meters of one of our POS locations. The diagram shows the percentage of different institutions within 100 meters of POSs according to observation. In Dhaka North City Corporation, the highest number of institutions that were found in front or within 100 meters of POS location were colleges (59.2%) and high schools (53.1%) respectively followed by coaching center (20.4%), primary schools (18.4%) etc. The lowest percentage of kindergartens (2%) was found near different POS locations. On the other hand, in Dhaka South City Corporation, maximum percentage of institutions was found within 100 meters of POSs were colleges (31.3%), high schools (31.3%) and hospitals (31.3%) followed by banks (25%), Clinics (18.8%) etc. while the lowest percentage was for coaching centers (6.3%) (Fig 4).

It can be observed that the majority of advertisements were displayed as posters (64.1%). Additionally, 23.1% of the advertisements were displayed as billboards, while the remaining 20.5% were shown as banners.

The results provide a comprehensive analysis of the distribution of e-shops in both Dhaka North City Corporation and Dhaka South City Corporation (Figs 5 and 6) respectively. For instance, within Dhaka North City Corporation, it is identified that 16 e-cigarette shops are situated within 100 meters of academic institutions. Similarly, within Dhaka South City Corporation, there are 39 e-cigarette shops within 100 meters of academic institutions (Figs 7 and 8) respectively. The e-cigarette shops located within the 100-meter buffer zone of hospitals are visually represented on the map (Fig 9). This visualization allows for a comprehensive understanding of the spatial relationship between e-cigarette shops, healthcare facilities, and educational institutions. Finally, the maps generated from the spatial analysis are carefully interpreted and analyzed to identify the patterns of e-cigarette shop distribution and their proximity to hospitals and academic institutions. This analysis has significant implications for understanding potential health risks associated with e-cigarette usage in close proximity to healthcare facilities and educational settings. The results of the buffer and multi-buffer ring analysis are graphically represented on the map. The results provide a comprehensive analysis of the distribution of e-shops in Dhaka North City Corporation. From the map, it is evident that Uttara, Mirpur, Gulshan, Banani, and Adabor are the areas with the highest concentration of e-shops in DNCC.

E-cigarettes do not contain tar. It uses synthetic nicotine. Since it is vaporizing, it does not seem to be a big deal. It may have featured a coil system and was installable with a liquid that has a sticky appearance. Four components, Propylene glycol (PG), Vegetable glycerin (VG), flavoring, and nicotine must all be present in a juice to be used. Propylene glycol, sometimes known as PG, is a colorless, odorless liquid. Vegetable glycerin, on the other hand, referred to as VG has a little sweet flavor and a slightly thicker consistency. According to the responses of retailers: The electronic cigarettes were rechargeable and looked like long pens. It was compatible with liquid installations and included maybe coil system.” [R03.001] “Regarding devices, the crucial elements are the battery, the Power IC for control, and the coils for activation. These coils are crucial for the process of converting the e-liquid into vapor. When it comes to e-liquids, there are four essential components that you need: propylene glycol (PG), vegetable glycerin (VG), flavoring, and nicotine. All four elements are essential for an enjoyable and satisfying vaping experience.” [R01.001] E-cigarette retailers believe that these products pose fewer health risks than traditional cigarettes due to their adjustable nicotine levels and lower nicotine content. However, they also mentioned some negative aspects- such as water can lodge in the lungs causing blockages and leading to abdominal gas. However, if nicotine is consumed in excess, several issues may arise. For example, stomach issues, one also has headaches, sinusitis, and migraines. Additionally, it has a nicotine tobacco flavor, which increases the risk of heart attack, certain flavors are ice flavor, which causes a cold, and occasionally it affects the throat and causes cancer when used frequently. Regarding all of these issues, retailers have confessed that: “Everything has side effects. ome chemicals are safe to breath, while others are harmful to human health. Consuming fruit-flavored juice will not affect your health. Fruit-flavored juice will not harm your body if you take it. When you consume that clone juice you will be harmed. Because they do not maintain food grade. Burning anything produces a tar that is inhaled and causes bacterial infections, as well as cancer due to chemicals.” [R03.007] “Blueberry drink is often unsuitable for a large number of people, who often choose not to consume it. However, few people complain of gastrointestinal discomfort from its use. Besides, I have not seen any trouble so far. If you smoke cigarettes for 90 to 100 years, then the risk of cancer is 100%. E-cigarettes are not carcinogenic. Cancer cells remain dormant in our body until they are triggered into activity by our unhealthy lifestyle choices. Subsequently, the cigarette is regarded as a medium that individuals believe is responsible for certain outcomes.” [R03.001] The key informants of our study talked about the health hazards associated with e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes contain non-natural substances, such as chemicals and juices, which can lead to various forms of cancer and affect the organs when burned. Other illnesses, such as asthma, may also manifest as well and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may occur. In addition, e-cigarette use by children can hinder brain development and, with prolonged use, may lead to a decrease in intelligence quotient (IQ). Furthermore, long-term nicotine use is likely to raise our risk of heart attack or stroke due to the atherosclerotic disease process that nicotine causes. “E-Cigarette contains nicotine means e-cigarettes are harmful to health and I say e-cigarette is never a substitute for a conventional cigarette I say it is not safe. Formaldehyde and acetate are very harmful to the body. As I have said before, even in our developed countries, there is a lot of research on e-cigarettes. The Japanese say that this cigarette is 10 times more harmful than normal cigarettes, because of its use which may lead to the development of various diseases including stroke, heart attack, or cardiac attack. E-cigarettes are in no way less harmful than traditional cigarettes.” [KII-05] “Long-term use of nicotine may lead to the development of atherosclerosis, a condition that increases the likelihood of heart attack or stroke. In addition, the presence of additional compounds in the substance might occasionally provide a danger of pneumonitis or lung infection. Furthermore, it is seen with many impurities due to which people have died. Nicotine is the cause of our addiction. It harms brain development when used by children. It may gradually decrease the level of intelligence if it is used extensively.” [KII-04] People between the ages of 20 and 35 are the most common users, and the younger generation tends to smoke it more frequently. The age range of female consumers is 18 to 40 years old, while that of male customers is 18 to 60 years old. Although children utilize it now, but the sellers do not support them in doing so. Since there are no rules there, children purchase from the sidewalk. Street vendors would profit more if they could sell more goods. “A mother of an intermediate student once came into the store complaining that her son was unable to concentrate on his studies without vaping. Another time, a 15-year-old boy arrived, and we advised him to start vaping after a few days. Later, the mother of the youngster arrived and said, "I’ll buy it for my son, so why should you have any problems?" [R03.007] All types of customers come here but the sellers do not sell to kids. People their 25 years and 30 years old make up the largest attendance group. The younger generation makes the most use of it. Although people of other ages visit as well, teenagers appear to come mostly to purchase vape. Older individuals, including those in their 40s and beyond, also frequent the place. Both lone individuals and groups make up the bulk. Middle-aged individuals typically smoke a large quantity of cigarettes throughout the day. They then encourage their friends who smoke to transition to e-cigarettes rather than continuing to smoke. Thus, friends influence friends. More boys come, while the number of girls is very limited. School-age students now visit during tiffin breaks and smoke cigarettes in tea stalls. “The majority of my customers are younger buyers, particularly those under 15 years old. Most of them are students, with boys from well-off families above 20 years old also making up a significant portion of my customer base. Around 70% of my customers are boys, while the remaining 30% are girls. Many of the girls are regular customers, with 5–6 of them coming to buy regularly. They usually come alone rather than in a group, except for the 7/8-year-old school children who come in groups. Additionally, it is common for one friend to bring another friend to buy on different days.” [R12.012] “The target audience is typically 18 to 24 years old. It’s becoming popular online, especially with active internet users who post cloud photos on Facebook. It’s a trending topic and can go viral” [RA12.001] “Small children also come but we have fewer here, go to the shop in Kurmitola and many school and college students come to buy e-cigarettes. Kids get interested in e-cigarettes by seeing others using them or seeing e-cigarette devices. And the boys and girls of Dhaka are a little more updated.” [R04.016] Everyone knows that cigarettes are bad for people in this day, particularly in the age of social media. However, users of e-cigarettes prefer to consume them to stop smoking. They believe that e-cigarettes are a safer option. E-cigarettes are less dangerous when compared to traditional cigarettes as they do not produce Bad odors. Here, there is more flavor addiction than nicotine addiction. In addition, it has become a direct fashion, so everyone wants to try it. There is a growing trend among the younger generation to associate vaping with being trendy and cool. Unlike traditional cigarettes, which emit strong odors and are often not tolerated in many places, e-cigarettes can be used almost anywhere. But people can use vape everywhere. Due to having these kinds of advantages people like to use e-cigarettes. “The reason is flavor addiction. Nicotine addiction is less here, flavor addiction is more. When you have a mango flavor in your mouth all day long, when you have an apple flavor, it feels a little soothing. So, there are the main things, flavors. They come back for the flavor.” [RA08.001] “Those who are over 30 years old are mostly smokers. They use vaping to abstain from smoking. People of this type mostly come to me. Some people come and tell me I want to quit smoking and suggest some flavorful vape. Some come here to buy vape due to the scent and flavor. I think most importantly people are using vaping as a substitute for smoking. If you light a cigarette near anyone, they think badly about them. If you do vape people do not think it is bad. It is seen that many have quit smoking due to vaping” [RA12.002] “The first reason behind this is that the customers consider this thing to be safe by using it by them. They did not have any problems. In addition, as the way we told them to use it, they follow that. By doing so they enjoyed vaping” [R01.001] In Bangladesh, e-cigarettes are not manufactured by any company. Instead, e-cigarette importers bring in various vaping devices and juices from other countries. These products are then supplied to wholesalers, distributors, and retailers in Bangladesh. Retailers from dedicated vape shops, other physical stores, and online stores sell e-cigarette products directly to consumers. “I brought all kinds of devices from China. Although the original brands are from the USA and UK, the products are manufactured in China. In addition, some Swiss ones are made in Switzerland that are very expensive. But they do not come to Bangladesh now, they used to come earlier” (R03.001) “All my juices here are from America and all devices are from China” (RO4.013) “…These companies are foreign companies. In our country no vape is produced, vapes come from outside countries. We have no authority over this matter” (RA12.002) “USA and China. I order the devices from China and liquid from the UK and USA. Liquid is also available in China, but we do not import” (R03.005) Our study respondents have shared that Mirpur, Gulistan, Dhanmondi, Nikunja, Baridhara, Gulshan, Banani, Uttara, etc. are the major hotspot of e-cigarettes. One of our responses mentioned that there is a factory in Chakbazar, from which they get the e-cigarettes. “In terms of availability, I would say Dhanmondi. In addition, if you say in the case of use, then in that case I will say Gulshan or Banani” (R01.001) “You will find it mostly in the Chalkbazar. If you want to see new types of vapes, you can visit Chalkbazar. They go wholesale there. Friendship market, 10 no. Lane. You can find more information regarding vaping there. They buy thousands of pieces” (RA12.002) Respondents also stated that e-cigarette marketing is expanding in places where more wealthy people stay. According to them, many people are already accustomed to these types of cigarettes and these are becoming available in every shopping complex. “You can find them in New Supermarket, Mirpur, Elephant Road, and Bashundhara City. Vapes are now sold in every shopping complex as an essential item, just like rice and fish. Sometimes using vapes makes everyone look smart” (RA12.001) “There are many shops in Gulistan. The residents of that area have more money, while the people in our area have less. It’s important to understand that there is a strong connection between the e-cigarette business and its location.” (R04.016) Long-term vaping has been shown to have negative health impacts; its replicas may even be more detrimental. In the case of inquiry regarding the availability of replicas, retailers emphasized that they are selling the original product imported from abroad, but there are many sellers of e-cigarettes in Chawkbazar, Newmarket, and Old Dhaka engaged in selling replica products. “I do not know if it is in Bangladesh or not but maybe in China. Dhaka New Market and Street Shop sell clones/replicas; they seem to sell Chinese juice. I am selling American Juice” (RO4.013) “I do not know that brother. It may happen. Nothing is impossible here, everything is possible…If you want to see them, then you will have to walk around the streets of Chawkbazar, Jinjira” (R04.016) “Replica means disposable devices; there are some clones of disposables in Bangladesh. There are several clone products available in Newmarket, they import them from China” (R05.001) Retailers’ comments indicate that e-cigarette duplicates are produced nearby, notably at Chawkbazar. Although it is challenging to replicate the device, fake juice may be made cheaply and sold for a lesser price. Since many people cannot afford the original e-cigarette and its fluids, these could boost marketing among the general public. One person described the procedure for creating replica juices, which he had heard from people he knew. “However, apart from the authentic products, clone products are available in the Round Square under the foot over the bridge and in the new market with budget money. We sell 100 ml in 1800 to 2400 taka. They sell 30 ml for 300 taka, which we cannot imagine. Replica juice does not come from another country; they are made in our own Bangladesh. Made in Jinjira and sold in Chawkbazar. The whole thing is distributed from Chawkbazar. Pod devices are not usually cloned. They are difficult to clone. Mod devices are often cloned” (R03.007) Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, TikTok, etc. are being used extensively as a way of buying and selling different kinds of products. Online marketing of e-cigarettes is also growing in Bangladesh. These also allow the sharing of necessary information regarding e-cigarettes, like their flavors, prices, promotional messages, delivery process, etc. Our study respondent stated that online media have made the e-cigarette business and delivery process easier as well. Online media, apps, and websites related to shopping, such as Daraz are also involved in e-cigarette marketing. “…Yes, Facebook, and Instagram. The page is mainly for online delivery of parcels. We don’t post videos on YouTube. Customers can place orders via WhatsApp and receive home delivery. We only deliver through Instagram if someone comments on the product’s picture or sends a personal message.” (R03.007) “Through online, we do business through our Facebook page. We also have a website. However, if it is in the case of wholesale, then it is normal to talk on the phone. So roughly, you can catch these dealings through WhatsApp or over the phone” (R01.001) “No, I do not give Ads. Daraz gives an ad… Yes, everything is available in Daraz. Over 90% of goods are sold in Daraz” (RA08.003) Moreover, some retailers also shared that in-store selling of e-cigarettes is more feasible for them. According to them, the promotion of this specific product in social media may become the reason for governmental sanction. Retailers have to keep themselves busy by selling different kinds of products at once in their stores. According to them, e-cigarette sales are more in their store than the online platform. Online business for e-cigarettes has become tougher for them, except for the dedicated e-cigarette shops. “Online promotion of tobacco products is prohibited by the government, and this also extends to social media.I do not know if it goes to foreign countries. Online sales for tobacco products are generally poor, as most transactions occur in physical stores” (R03.001) “Long ago, I had a Facebook page called "Gazette King" where I posted pictures. Now I do not run it. My shop sells more than the page. Those who have free time can browse the page. I do not have that time” (R12.012) A few retailers acknowledged that they offer electronic cigarettes offline as well as online. “Both online order and direct selling… Since home delivery is an option, many people also want to visit the shop… I would say 20% is online. We have many in-shop customers” (RA08.001) To promote products retailers rarely use postering or other offline marketing. Dedicated shops for e-cigarette marketing use online marketing strategies more than that of physical stores that sell these devices as a side business. They depend on online marketing strategies more and advise customers to see or give reviews on Facebook and other business apps. Discounts are offered occasionally, but it is not maintained according to any specific product or occasion. First-time customers are given some benefits. To generate interest in their products, they have a range of eye-catching e-cigarettes featured on their website (also, their Facebook page features numerous images of e-cigarettes) for their eyes to perceive the attraction. In addition, they just say they will sell it at a low price, even if the customers take the flavor they will sell it also at a low price. The people who see the product know the value, and that is why they buy it. Therefore, there is nothing to make lucrative here. They try to give advertisements, but there is a risk of banning the page. Customer satisfaction and taste addiction are also factors. There has been observed an alluring representation of different types of devices in the store. Retailers also use verbal explanations and motivation, which convince them to buy e-cigarettes. Some statements of respondents are given below: “I always ask customers about their vaping needs, whether it’s for creating big clouds or to help quit smoking. Based on their response, I introduce them to different products. I had mentioned earlier that e-cigarettes can be harmful, although less than traditional cigarettes. We tell people that it is also harmful to those who do not know. Keep a few interesting e-cigarettes now and then. We do not show. We put a variety of interesting e-cigarettes on the online page (Facebook page) just to make people interested that we have some interesting vapes in our store. So that the attraction works in their eyes” [R03.001] “I will sell it also at a low price. There was a separate display case for vaping on one side of the shop. A customer was shown an interesting vape device that looked like a pistol” [R12.012] “It is more or less, everyone involved in marketing. Anyone who has any stock is taking pictures and just sharing them. Just this. Because of the way our vaping thing is, we do not need to make it lucrative here. Many people recognize the value of our product and that’s why they buy it” [R01.001] During the pandemic, companies have provided e-cigarettes to households via social media. Therefore, since there is no law, they take advantage of every tactic at their disposal to attract customers. They have chosen to target a specific age group, especially the young generation, so that is where they will draw it out and brand it to sustain the business for a long period. After conducting research, the tobacco businesses discovered that lowering the price is necessary to reach more individuals. They are using a technique to lower the price because of this. They might be strategizing ways to reduce the cost of the products. The market will grow as more people become dependent on it. In addition, in the drama industry, the producers and directors receive financial support to maintain scenes featuring smoking electronic cigarettes for promotional purposes. “The marketing strategy seems to involve targeted social media campaigns. Users who are in the young group are sent targeted messages with information and in terms of marketing they use online marketing mostly and now it is available in different stores and different markets” [KII-04] “I have seen that they have targeted an age group, meaning the target group is where, even under the grave, they will pull it out and then brand it. Therefore, not only an educational institution but also the age group, that age group is their target. They grab a group between the ages of twelve and twenty. So, if they can make them addicted, I said they will do business for up to 75 years. They will not show much interest in an old 55–60-year-old person like me. Since I could pass away before I turn eight or ten years old. There is no profit in investing in this business. So, they target the place where that age group is available [KII-01] “The tobacco companies have researched and found that if it is to reach people, they have to bring down the price. That is why they are bringing down the price by strategy. They may be planning how to make the devices cheaper. They have a plan. Nothing happens to them without planning. When he becomes dependent, the market will expand. It may be, now their sales are maybe 10,000 per year. So, if the price is reduced it may increase the sales to 20000 per year” [KII-02] “It seems to me that the promotion is an increase in dramas, which was not before. Coca-Cola spent a lot of money to feature the brand in an Aamir Khan movie. So now, if they show smoking, maybe they take at least a few cores to show a smoking scene for only 10 seconds to 20 seconds. These are industry promotions. In drama, it is the producers and directors who are given money to keep this scene in our drama industry promotion. And especially if there is a popular actor-actress, and in our OTT platform, I do not see that much, but I have heard from people who study that the hero is in a bad mood, takes e-cigarettes, drinks, takes cigarettes, even when he is in a good mood. The matter is like that” [KII-03] The sellers emphasized promoting e-cigarettes by expressing that, these e-cigarettes can cause some harm, but they are still less than traditional cigarettes, which is yet unproven. The customers unaware of those statements become well-informed, while the aware do not need an explanation beforehand to buy e-cigarettes. They offer options to customers and give them a polite explanation when they arrive. When a consumer visits, the sellers first try to understand their preferences and reasons for vaping. Customers who were trying to give up smoking were assisted in selecting juice. “Normal cigarettes have bad smells. Maybe that causes them problems. Their wives may scold them for smoking. If they use vape, they will not have any problems. At home, they can use vape too.” [RA12.002] “When a customer comes to us, we first try to understand his preferences and why he wants to vape. If he comes to quit smoking, we help him choose juice.” [R05.001] “In my opinion, if you like it, then go ahead and take it. When you take it, the smoke will come out, but if you don’t take it, the smoke won’t come out. This is just the approach. I do not tell someone to buy it. I do not tell them it is good, take it.” [RA08.003] E-cigarette sales are largely dependent on liquid and device quality. Only those who are aware of e-cigarettes purchase the devices; others do not. On Facebook, the sellers do only post. The vast majority of the sellers do not write sales-oriented statements outside the shop. Their clients handle the majority of their marketing. Because a satisfied customer will refer five more customers to purchase the product. Therefore, the sellers do not need that type of marketing that much. “It has to be said that the customer will not understand which is good and which is bad. Flavor, device, price, and quality are different. It is better than smoked cigarettes, I usually say. If the smoke is more, the quality will be better. If the coil is damaged, you can change it here. You will get liquid of many flavors, I will keep less money, its quality will be better—this is what I say” [R12.012] “I will not say any such slogans or statements. Slogan base statement we will give when we protest it. We do not need to protest. We are doing something good. If you want to join us, you can join. There are many anti-alcohol protests, but there are a few people here who are anti-alcohol. So, we do not have slogans for these things. We are providing safer options if you can join you can join. See how you like it. If you like the culture, then you can live with it” [R01.001] Retailers stated that they do not offer any advertisements about the marketing of e-cigarettes, although they have been noticed on Facebook sites, YouTube, and Instagram. Facebook features advertisements, and users have the option to see reviews and watch videos on vaping. Sometimes, Daraz occasionally runs advertisements. “No, brother, currently YouTube is your platform for giving reviews. We mainly operate through reviews. For example, we recently reviewed Jellybox, and we set the Google price at 2600, but we sold it for 2400. We offer discounts on each product” [RA12.001] “Every shop has signage outside. Like we have the ‘Vape in’ (shop name) logo outside in large form. So, we keep all branding up to the shop. Yes, there is a review system. However, this culture has not yet developed in Bangladesh” [R01.001] Among them, one of the people shared his experience in another way as if he had seen an ad regarding this: “I have seen an ad for another shop. Like a few days ago, “BARBIE” came out. Like this they took a picture which has “TANBIE” with the picture of the vape” [RA08.001] The majority of the sellers do not give any written advertisement. People do not post product details that much now unless it is a second-hand selling post. Maximum people know about vape, in that case, sellers give the name of the product and the flavor of the juice. If customers want to know the rest, they can search on Google. “No (Smiling). I have never seen an advertisement for e-cigarettes.” [RO4.013] Some of them shared that some written statements they use for marketing like- It is less harmful than smoky cigarettes, waking up and smelling vape, and so on. “Coil it, wick it, juice it, vape it; Eat, sleep, vape; It’s glamorous on film but it’s not glamorous, waking up and smelling vape like an ashtray; Keep calm and vape like an ashtray; More stronger, more tasty; Under age 18 is prohibited” [R03.007] Regarding giveaways for retailers to promote e-cigarettes, the majority of the sellers shared that they do not get anything regarding this, if a device breaks, it is the vendors’ fault, and they are not even eligible for a refund. However, gifts are provided when something is sold in the market as well and those who import it may get it. “The thing is that vape is now sold at large. No need for them to give discounts. The wholesalers buy them from foreign countries. If they buy them at a cheap price, they can give some discount. Getting a discount from the company is not possible. These are for limited profit” [RA12.002] “I used to get it, but now I do not get it. When a new design or model of a product comes, they would give a new model along with the previous product model. They said that a new one has come and please check the device without cost.” [R03.001] Regarding sales, there is a single computation. Sellers might increase sales by lowering their prices. Because not everyone can afford to purchase vaping items at all. The internet pages must be visited, posts must be created, and they must be promoted to enhance sales. Opening more locations in well-located retail centers will be necessary to boost e-cigarette sales. The difference is in how things work offline and online. Selling products online has the potential to boost sales. People prefer to purchase more things when they watch the advertisement. Additionally, there are cash-back incentives, which is a wonderful addition. “In order to boost sales, we need to open online pages, create posts, and promote them. While there are some complications, they are manageable, and the main challenge is the time commitment. The sale of any item depends on marketing, if the marketing is good, the sales will increase.” [R04.016] Despite the high costs, they wish to open a new branch. If the system for cash back is implemented, it will benefit them. But if it is all governed by the established guidelines and oversight, they will also help to promote it. The uncertainty surrounding the government’s recent declaration regarding e-cigarettes is a cause for alarm, though. “First we have to create the market, we have to expand the business, and then we have to do the promotion. Now it is too late to bring the product. However, when everything is regulated by an official organization, everything will be under supervision, and then there will be demand. I will get the product quickly. Then the market will be created.” [R03.007] Regarding the views of the sellers, rather than prohibiting it, the government should promote it. The sellers have no control over it. If the government bans it, they will do other business. Alcohol and cigarettes are legal. Even if the government forbids them, they are powerless to challenge its decisions because their decisions are final. After that, they will stop selling it. Apart from banning e-cigarettes, smoking should be outlawed at the same time. Again, British Tobacco has been pressuring the government for several years to ban e-cigarettes. Because e-cigarettes have caused a decline in their sales in the market. However, the seller plans to tell the government, that if e-cigarettes are less harmful than normal cigarettes, then they should not stop them. “if the government closes it, I will do another business. If it closes, there is no problem; there is no lack of business. And I am a small one and those who have big businesspeople will think about them.” [RO4.013] “If they ban it, we will be at a loss. It will be better if they do not ban it. People of all ages can use it. And cigarettes cannot be used everywhere. E-cigarettes can be used everywhere, and smokers of all ages can use them. There is no obstacle. If you stop it, the bad people, the drunk party people, will get more addicted to other substances. If they vape, the risk will not be so much.” [R12.012] One of them also shared regarding governments’ approach to forever banning e-cigarettes in the future in another way like “They (government) have tried. But we have powerful people. We will fight to continue it. Because I know cigarettes are bad. Now if the government of Bangladesh wants people to die by smoking cigarettes that is fine. We will try our best.” [RA08.001] In response to inquiries, key informants of our study have shared some challenging issues for E-cigarette banning in Bangladesh. One of the main obstacles to limiting the marketing of e-cigarettes is their addictive nature, which stems from their thousands of flavors and appealing designs. Some of the respondents claim that those connected to the e-cigarette wholesale industry could obstruct the enactment and maintenance of e-cigarette control legislation. Furthermore, a few massive tobacco industries may have influenced legislators. Nevertheless, to expedite the e-cigarette ban, the health ministries must work harmoniously with other ministries in an integrative manner. “The business of addictive products is enormous. As a result, consumers who purchase these products often behave irrationally. Their behavior is not rational when it comes to buying these products. Even when they know that addiction is a risk, the price does not deter them. Their addiction is driven by the product’s flavor. Despite being aware of the negative consequences, they continue to support the business. These consumers are so heavily influenced that they cannot grasp the logic behind their actions. It all boils down to the money going into the pockets of those behind the business, which the consumers willingly spend.” [KII 1] “Regarding the challenge of the ban, I said that those who are very normal, those who are associated with this business, those who are planning this business, and those who will produce it in this country, want this law not to be passed, maybe they will delay this law. They will do two things, first not to pass. Compromise will come in the second stage, weakening it a bit. What do you mean weak? They will say that it is not a ban, they will talk about control. As we call the Tobacco Control Law, so is the E-Cigarette Control Law. That is how to control it”. [KII-1] “The first is that tobacco companies are giant companies. They influence everything from the policy level. Therefore, this is a big challenge. And their tactics are bad, they create influence where there are policymakers to motivate them in different ways. So that is a challenge for us. Another big challenge that we face is that we policymakers need to look at these issues from a public health perspective; as this is a public health issue” [KII2] “It seems that there are significant challenges related to industry restrictions. The Ministry of Health has tried to initiate changes to the law in order to protect public health. However, there is a lack of support from other ministries such as the Ministry of Industries, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Finance, and NBR. It appears that these ministries prioritize financial gain over public health, making it difficult to enact the necessary changes. This lack of support has ultimately prevented the correction from taking place. It seems that there are internal barriers preventing the progress of these crucial amendments. [KII 3] For Bangladesh’s e-cigarette ban to be successful, it is crucial to implement specific measures to oppose the extensive marketing and promotion of these items. Currently, there is no law in Bangladesh regarding e-cigarettes. Based on the responses from our key informants, we know that campaigns against e-cigarette banning have been going on for more than three years. Furthermore, the government of Bangladesh has already drafted a bill that will shortly be approved by the parliament. Additionally, there is a variety of non-governmental organizations and anti-tobacco organizations working on awareness campaigns about these problems. “There is no law, there is nothing. We tried to say, it should be banned. And the campaign is going on for 2–3 years… and the government has decided in principle, a draft has been prepared. Now it was supposed to be raised before this election in the cabinet, no, after the election we hope, if there is no major interference, it will be passed here and then it will be passed in the parliament. Therefore, this has been a movement from civil society for a long time. The Government is also motivated, the Ministry of Health of the Government has made a regulation” [KII 1] “There are different foundations they create front groups to bring these things, create business groups like we all know “Smoke-Free Foundation” they promote this e-cigarette all over the world as harm reduction” [KII- 4] “Not only NGOs, all the anti-tobacco organizations in Bangladesh are working on it, that it is harmful to the body and health, that it should be banned, all the anti-tobacco organizations in Bangladesh, not only a particular NGO, BCCP, who give you these grants, also work on it”. [KII 1] “We held press conferences, rallies, discussion meetings, and wrote different articles…Our organization has a Facebook page called Tobacco Free Bangladesh. If you go there, you will see that we posted about this cigarette. We also have a YouTube channel called DAM-Health. There we made a video about e-cigarettes and gave a message to make people aware. We re-share those videos on Facebook. In this way, we are making people aware… At the national level, not only us but many organizations, and some other anti-tobacco organizations have conducted programs on e-cigarettes. However, at the local level, I do not think anyone is doing it at the district level or upazila level. Because till now it remains a national issue because there is no law.” [KII -2] “No, there is no finalized law and policy in Bangladesh so far. The Tobacco Control Act of 2005 has been amended once in 2013 having some loopholes. The revision work is still ongoing. This has been proposed in this amendment of the Act… Organizations working in the tobacco control community. As I work for people many other foundations work for people. Like the National Heart Foundation and Ahsania Mission, we have some alliances with doctors and the media. E.g., Bangladesh Anti-Tobacco Alliance, and Anti-Tobacco Media Alliance. Some such alliances and some individual organizations and individuals are doing the work regularly” [KII-5] We can incorporate certain important steps to regulate or restrict e-cigarettes in Bangladesh based on the key informant’s responses. Its importation must be halted under the particular HS code. Strict regulations should be in place surrounding the marketing of e-cigarettes, and those who sell these products without a license must be compensated. The purchase of electronic cigarette devices should be restricted based on age and information about the harmful health effects of e-cigarettes. Since children and adolescents grow up in monitored environments, we can make sure that their use of e-cigarettes is strictly prohibited. The sale of e-cigarettes in the stores next to various educational institutions ought to be prohibited. Since e-cigarettes are portrayed as a healthy substitute for regular cigarettes, we can raise consciousness about the negative health impacts of e-cigarettes and encourage smokers to pursue other nicotine replacement therapies. “The first thing is that importation with HS code should be stopped. Imports should be stopped and then other routes that come in should slowly tried to be stopped. Apart from that, to stop the distribution, if you give the facility to import with HS code, then to distribute it—it is a legitimate product, anyone can distribute & sell it as they can. We did not arrange the license or anything like that.” [KII 4] “Already e-cigarette has been banned in India… It is prescribed as a prescription drug in the UK. Those who wish to quit at once and it is not being given to anyone under 18 years of age… meaning there is an age limit. In America, they have made a rule that no flavor can be given. It is only given to those who want to quit tobacco, but they have banded off the flavors that would have been given to attract children. Besides, many other countries have completely banned it. At the local level, it should strictly ensure that children do not come to school with this item…Now the average initiation age for e-cigarette sage in Bangladesh is 15–16 years old… Doctors also are prescribing because it is available in the market. If it becomes illegal then there is no chance to prescribe…We have nicotine replacement therapy for nicotine, nicotine gum, and nicotine lozenges…” [KII 4] “I have no idea about reducing distribution. I have no idea about the distribution mechanism. It has to be Law/Policy Implementation. The sale of e-cigarettes under the age of 18 cannot be implemented in our country. We have to ban it…import, export, production, marketing everything is prohibited…All types of production, marketing, sale, purchase, and marketing should be banned. Besides, we cannot give a healthy Bangladesh to the next generation. Our present people who are in policy-making, will not be alive anymore, they are supporting such activities and misdeeds for their benefit. Those who come after that will be victims of it. And many people will get sick, the young generation will suffer, and it will drive them to other addictions.” [KII-3] This study provides insights regarding the availability, distribution, marketing strategy, and possible ways to reduce e-cigarettes in Bangladesh. First of all, the participants of the study perceived e-cigarettes as long, pen-shaped rechargeable devices that may have included a coil system and installable liquid with a sticky appearance that uses synthetic nicotine and does not include tar, which supports earlier research showing that e-cigarettes are battery-operated devices that heat and aerosolize "e-liquid." [39], and which requires inhaling vaporized nicotine during consumption [40], and the dangerous ingredients found in regular cigarettes, such as tar and carcinogens, were absent in e-cigarettes [40]. This study also shows that there are two main differences between traditional cigarettes and e-cigarettes: conventional cigarettes contain more nicotine than e-cigarettes, but e-cigarettes do not contain tar, which can lead to cancer. According to a previous study, it was found that many people believed e-cigarettes to be healthier than traditional cigarettes because they do not contain tar, smoke, or carcinogens [40]. Some participants also noted that e-cigarettes have lesser side effects than conventional cigarettes and help to normal cigarettes cessation. These findings are consistent with a previous study [41]. Regarding e-cigarette health impacts, our research found that besides serious issues like blockages, water can lodge in the lungs and produce abdominal gas. Additionally, using e-cigarettes may result in headaches, migraines, sinusitis, and gastrointestinal problems. It also contains nicotine tobacco flavor, which raises the risk of a heart attack; some varieties, like ice flavor, give you a cold. Sometimes, if you use it repeatedly, it causes cancer in the throat. The majority of the results are consistent with other researches showing that e-smoking can increase the risk of lung cancer and induce symptoms like nausea, vomiting, headaches, dizziness, choking, burn injuries, irritation of the upper respiratory tract, dry cough, and dry eyes and mucous membranes [42, 43]. Some of the participants in our study stated that e-cigarettes are more frequently smoked by younger individuals and their age range is between 20 to 35. Girls are extremely rare, while boys are more prevalent. Prior studies also showed consistent results, younger age groups are more likely to have ever used or are now using e-cigarettes [44]. Use of e-cigarettes is higher among boys but girls are increasingly at risk [45]. Some participants of this study also reported that children buy from the sidewalk because there are no restrictions there. However, there are few studies to compare these findings with therefore more extensive research is needed to bolster these conclusions. To guide future research on e-cigarette, use among teenagers and young adults and to inform policymakers and consumers about making evidence-based decisions, a thorough grasp of this literature is necessary [46]. Young individuals who use e-cigarettes run the danger of using cigarettes in the future. Since banning tobacco products has been shown to lower youth smoking rates, strict regulations pertaining to e-cigarettes are necessary for prevention [47]. Our findings revealed that e-cigarette importers usually import different types of vaping devices and juices from abroad. Similar findings were found, most of their e-cigarettes device and liquid come from abroad in Norway [48]. Our study respondents shared that Mirpur, Gulistan, Dhanmondi, Nikunja, Baridhara, Gulshan, Banani, Uttara, etc. are the major hotspot of e-cigarettes and some retailers’ sale replica of e-cigarettes in some place. To compare our findings there has not been found any previous study regarding this result. Our study revealed that e-cigarette distribution mostly occurs on online platforms such as Facebook and You Tube, this finding aligns with previous studies conducted in the United States. The majority of consumers had bought tobacco or e-cigarettes through online platforms, and both online and offline buyers noted that price and convenience had influenced their decision to buy tobacco or e-cigarettes from the online sites [49]. Furthermore, social media platforms serve as the main channel for e-cigarette distribution in Thailand [50]. Some participants in this study also highlighted that sometimes discounts are available, and many of the individuals who see the goods are aware of their value, which is why they purchase them. Moreover, addictive flavor and customer satisfaction are always in demand among customers, and if they can offer an outstanding flavor, it will work better to promote the e-cigarette brands. These findings are also consistent with a study [49] which found that there are four main reasons why people buy e-cigarettes online: price (cheaper online, discounts, buying in bulk); product characteristics (quality, availability); buying experience (time, convenience, reading reviews); and curiosity. In this study, regarding motivating the buyer’s approach to selling e-cigarettes, the retailers provide options to clients and greet them with courtesy upon arrival with a polite explanation, and customers attempting to quit smoking receive assistance in choosing juice. It also aligns with another study that found that individuals preferred to make purchases in person due to the opportunity to visually see, physically experience, and handle the goods, as well as receive guidance from store in person [49]. However, the quality of the liquid and device has a major impact on e-cigarette sales. The devices are only available to people who are aware of e-cigarettes; others who are not or do not buy them. The customers they serve do most of their marketing. The retail channel is the primary means of marketing cigarettes, as evidenced by a prior study that showed the bulk of cigarette companies’ advertising and promotional budgets were allocated for its distribution [51]. However, further extensive research is needed to address the lack of available literature on promotional statements regarding e-cigarette sales. Moreover, the majority of sellers, according to the report, do not provide written advertisements. When merchants disclose the product name and juice flavor, the majority of individuals who are aware of vaping use Google to find out more information regarding this and they also find reviews and videos on vaping on Facebook or YouTube. At the same time, vendors give some promotional speeches pleasantly related to the marketing of e-cigarettes. An earlier study showed that e-cigarette businesses’ marketing tactics have been linked to the rise in young users and video advertisements on digital platforms were found to be the most prevalent approach [52]. A previous study [53] also revealed that, using terms associated with the promotion of e-cigarettes, YouTube has been utilizing for this and consistent with this study. This study also found that retailers may boost e-cigarette sales by reducing their prices. When customers see advertisements, people tend to buy more products. This finding is in line with an earlier study that also found that sponsored events and social media advertising might be crucial parts of an effective e-cigarette marketing plan to boost e-cigarette sales [54]. Additionally, the offering of cash back incentives might serve as an effective strategy to enhance the sales of e-cigarettes. This study also made clear that every individual has a unique profit and sales volume, which vary based on where their stores are located In our study the majority of interviewees disclosed that they did not receive anything from the wholesalers or merchandizers; even if a device malfunctions, it is the vendors’ responsibility, and they are not even qualified for reimbursement. Since this was not included in the earlier research, a large-scale mixed-method study ought to be carried out to make this finding more generalizable. Nonetheless, the majority of vendors are happy with their businesses, and they want to launch new branches despite the high startup costs. They will also aid in its promotion if everything is in their favors. The uncertainty surrounding the government’s recent declaration regarding e-cigarettes is a cause for alarm, though. A previous survey also showed that a large number of states and towns have changed their smoke-free legislation to restrict public usage and ban the sale of e-cigarettes [55]. For instance, it appears that while they are happy with the sales of e-cigarettes, the prospect of a ban is a significant obstacle to their ability to operate their business sustainably. This study analyzed the potential future scenario of governments completely prohibiting e-cigarettes and found that sellers have no influence or control over this decision. They will conduct business elsewhere if the government outlaws it and they cannot contest the government’s judgments since they are final, even if it forbids them. Previous research indicated that electronic cigarettes (ECs) might pose a significant public health risk in the future for India, which is the world’s second-largest tobacco consumer with over 65% of its population under 35 years old. For now, it appears that outlawing ECs in India is the most practical course of action [56], and following example set by Punjab’s lead, other Indian states including Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Kerala also banned e-cigarettes. Additionally, countries such as Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam have already banned e-cigarettes [32]. Thus, resilient regulatory measures and an outright ban on e-cigarettes are required to avert future health concerns. The use of very effective marketing and promotion tactics has significantly increased the popularity of vaping and e-cigarettes. These efforts have attracted new consumers by offering innovative vaping products, causing substantial damage to the tobacco industry [57]. According to our study findings, there is a necessity of actionable laws and regulations regarding e-cigarettes in Bangladesh. In August 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a formal regulation asserting its jurisdiction over e-cigarettes. This regulation established a minimum age of 18 for purchasing e-cigarettes and introduced standardized requirements, including premarket approval applications, disclosure of harmful and potentially harmful ingredients, and the use of cautionary labels [32]. All web-based sellers of e-cigarettes have to be obliged to inform customers with clear precautionary information, at the very least in the form of wording that is visibly shown on the homepage. It ought to be against the law for them to use marketing strategies, such as complimentary samples, incentive schemes, and sales campaigns, etc. [26]. Additionally, we also found out that, our experts recommended strengthening licensing requirements, imposing age restrictions on purchases, stepping up awareness campaigns about the negative health consequences of e-cigarettes, and continuous license verification for e-cigarettes selling etc., in the perspective of Bangladesh. Similar findings was found to regulate e-cigarettes, its sale is prohibited in some number of nations and in some country there need license to sale those product [58]. Many nations have implemented rules regarding the import of e-cigarettes [58]. However, one of the biggest controversies about e-cigarettes is whether these gadgets are used for medicinal purposes or as recreational substances [59]. The biggest obstacle we confront is that many young people mistakenly believe that these products are healthier substitutes for traditional, smoke-filled cigarettes. For this reason, outlawing e-cigarettes is far more important than controlling them. Therefore, enacting laws that expedite the approval process, developing robust rules about the usage of e-cigarettes, and developing future regulatory mechanisms to solve obstacles to minimize the marketing of e-cigarettes could be several good approaches regarding this issue. Our study had some limitations. First of all, presenting compelling statistical data was difficult when employing the qualitative approach. Second, the interviewer occasionally felt uncomfortable responding to the questions since they were unaccustomed to delivering information using the qualitative approach, which occasionally made it difficult to determine the meaning in detail. In order to provide a universal appeal, large-scale researches that take into account the mixed-method design should be carried out to investigate this topic further. This study offers a comprehensive exploration of the e-cigarette landscape in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. It uncovers significant insights into production, distribution, marketing strategies, and health perceptions. The findings undergo the urgent need for regulatory interventions and create public awareness initiatives to address the complex challenges arising from the widespread availability and marketing of e-cigarettes, particularly among the youth population. E-cigarettes are being sold in various shops where people usually go for their necessary belongings like cosmetics, watches, sunglasses, confectionary items etc. and most alarmingly surrounded by academic institutions that are expanding. Moreover, these vaping devices are being imported into Bangladesh under different codes as well as other unrecognized ways from abroad. This exposure and accessibility encourage the younger generations to consume e-cigarettes. Customers purchase e-cigarettes through online and offline means and the sellers motivate them that these are less harmful options compared to the traditional ones. The study contributes valuable knowledge for informed policymaking and public health strategies to mitigate the potential long-term consequences of e-cigarette use in the context of Dhaka City. It emphasizes the importance of a coordinated and proactive approach to safeguard public health. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312802.s001 (XLSX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312802.s002 (XLSX) All those who participated actively in this study are gratefully acknowledged by the authors.

Fed cuts rates by 25 basis points On Thursday, the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points, or a quarter percentage point, bringing the target range to 4.50%-4.75%. At the Fed's news conference, chair Jerome Powell told reporters he would not resign if requested by Donald Trump, and that Trump does not have the power to fire or demote him. Momentum behind markets U.S. markets continued advancing on Thursday, propelled by postelection momentum. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index added 0.62%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index reversed gains to drop around 0.8% after the island's central bank reduced its interest rate by 25 basis points, in lockstep with the Fed's move. New fiscal stimulus expected from China China is expected to announce a new fiscal stimulus package when its parliament ends a five-day meeting on Friday. Analysts think the scale of support might be higher than initially planned because of Trump's threats of tariffs – that might go as high as 60% – on Chinese imports. Nissan's bad quarter Japanese automaker Nissan reported on Thursday that it made a net loss of 9.3 billion yen (around $62 million) during its fiscal second quarter. Operating profit, which is how much a company makes before taxes and other charges, plunged almost 85% year on year. Nissan also lowered its full-year outlook. Shares fell as much as 10% before recovering slightly. [PRO] Bitcoin might hit $100,000 Bitcoin surged to its highest price of more than $76,000 after Trump won the U.S election. Analysts think the cryptocurrency can climb further to reach the $100,000 milestone by the end of the year. Wednesday's postelection rally, during which the S&P popped 2.53%, was the best postelection move in the index's history, according to Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid, head of global economics and thematic research. Some of that momentum carried over to Thursday. The S&P continued its advance and gained 0.74%. Tech stocks, such as Apple, Meta Platforms and Nvidia, rose, helping the Nasdaq Composite climb 1.51% to close above 19,000 for the first time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, petered out. The 30-stock index traded around the flatline, weighed down by losses in financial stocks. "The market is signaling that a Trump administration would be good for growth and risk assets," said Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X ETFs, "but the combination of faster growth with new tariffs would be inflationary." If inflation resurfaces, the Fed's likely to stay its hand in lowering rates. That concern might be dampening investors' excitement in the stock market for now. Powell, in yesterday's press conference, maintained that "the election will have no effect on our policy decisions." Still, the Fed would be impacted by the decisions of the next administration. "Just in principle, it's possible that any administration's policies or policies put in place by Congress could have economic effects over time," he said. "Forecasts of those economic effects would be included in our models of the economy." Data from the CME FedWatch Tool suggests some prudence is filtering into the market. According to the futures market, just 30.4% of traders think the Fed will cut rates again in January. By contrast, 53% expect the Fed to keep rates steady. Those percentages are contingent on the central bank lowering rates to 4.25%-4.50% in December. Of course, that's all prognostication, and we know how inaccurate polls and bets can be. "By December, we'll have more data, I guess one more employer report, two more inflation reports and lots of other data," Powell said. The Fed prefers hard numbers. In markets, as in other aspects of our lives, that's probably good advice. — CNBC's Jeff Cox, Lisa Kailai Han, Hakyung Kim, Jesse Pound and Alex Harring contributed to this report.

We’ve reached a new stage in the AI boom. Big Tech earnings — and the rest of the market — have been bolstered by the AI era. But now, Wall Street is expecting more than just promises. Are these companies set up for success? Or is it a pressure they can’t quite handle? This transcript was prepared by a transcription service. This version may not be in its final form and may be updated. Jeremy Owens: Hello, and welcome to On Watch by MarketWatch. I'm Jeremy Owens. It's been another busy week here at MarketWatch as we cover the election. While the Newsroom continues to dive into Donald Trump's win and what it means for the economy, we wanted to make sure you didn't miss some other very important numbers, Big Tech's earnings and AI promises. So today we're going to visit with Dan Gallagher, the Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street tech columnist. Plus, we'll tell you about other news we're watching this election week, including the Federal Reserve meeting and how all of it will impact your wallet. Last week, Microsoft executives finally answered Wall Street's big question, how much is the company actually making from generative AI? The company expects to surpass 10 billion in annual revenue from AI next quarter. That number might've pushed the stock higher three or six months ago, but after this report, the market had a scary Halloween. Microsoft's stock dropped 6%, pulling the S&P 500 into the red on the last day of October. That ended a five-month winning streak for the market. The problem? Microsoft's forecast was a little shy of Wall Street expectations for cloud growth, which just felt so 2022. And it wasn't just Microsoft. All the Big Tech stocks seemed to move less on their executives' AI promises and more on actual financial performance. So what happened in this round of earnings, and what does it mean for the future? To answer those questions, I brought in Dan Gallagher, who covers tech for the Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street column. Here's what he told me about what happened with Microsoft. Dan Gallagher: I think especially if you compare to this time last year when AI hype was just driving everything and these companies could raise the CapEx to (inaudible) levels and just blow money out the door, and get rewarded for it because investors saw all upside in the future and they realized obviously, nothing was going to happen that year. ChatGPT had just launched. So I think it's now like we're a year ahead, money is still going out the door in even more obscene amounts, and it's going to keep getting bigger next year. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, that $10 billion figure that Microsoft mentioned pales in comparison to what they're saying they're going to spend on capital expenditures on building out this AI infrastructure. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And to drill on that $10 billion number a little bit, we got to realize that okay, one, that's including a lot of stuff, things like OpenAI. OpenAI sends a lot of their compute to Microsoft. That helps the Azure number some. And especially with Microsoft, I think investors are starting to get a little bit more picky about what they want to see. In particular, there's a lot of questions about, is Copilot generating anything? Jeremy Owens: Yeah. And Copilot is the AI software they're selling, and we've talked about on this program before as the true test of this AI cycle hype. Obviously, we're seeing a lot of hardware sales and cloud computing sales go through, but it's that next lug, the software, is that going to sell? And that's why that's so important, is because Microsoft is out there in front of all these others, and if they can sell the software, it shows that maybe others can as well. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. And we don't really know how that's going for them yet. In terms of what Copilot specifically is bringing out, I think there's not so much skepticism on that 10 billion number, but it didn't really answer a lot of the questions that more on Wall Street actually have. There's different demands for AI. There's obviously these AI companies that are using cloud services right now because they need to train their models, a ton of compute there. But at the end of the day, the future of AI is going to be our businesses and consumers paying and paying extra for AI tools and AI services. So, Copilot is really central to that. Jeremy Owens: But it seems like companies now are willing to just put it in front of as many people as possible in their organization to see how they use it. At some point, they're going to have to look and say, "Well, how many people are actually using it?" For a lot of white-collar execs, it's like, "Oh good, we get a meeting transcript." Is that worth 30 bucks a month to the company for everybody to have access to those meeting transcripts? That's a big question moving forward. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And we've seen a term, it's a jargony term, but we call it rationalization. Rationalization is when you have a company that's looking at its spending on things like software and cloud services and thinks, okay, maybe we're spending a little too much here, we need to bring it back, or we need to match our spending with what we're actually using. We saw that with all the cloud services a couple years ago where they had a huge jump of growth in COVID, but after a couple years of that, there was this need to kind of, okay, not everything's being used. We need to bring our budgets in order. So I think we'll probably see those dynamics play out over the medium term with things Copilot. It'll all come down to, is there actual use happening on the ground? It's still too early I think to really see that on a mass scale, and I think one of the things that... It's going to test investors' patience, is that people change their work habits really slowly and reluctantly, even if a new tool comes along that says, "Oh, this is going to make it a lot easier." So I think that's another thing that investors have to factor in, is that to get the take-up, it's going to take time. Jeremy Owens: What Microsoft said about AI did not cause its stock to drop 6%. It really was about the forecast being just a tiny bit soft, and that's very standard. This goes back to where we were before all the AI hype. To me, it was like it's all about the forecast and your actual results, and nothing Microsoft said made me think 6% less of them. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. Microsoft historically, they're not aggressive with their forecasts, so I don't think I recall ever seeing them do what I would call a blowout forecast. Very conservative. I think you have to also factor in, last week's market was just a jittery market overall. I saw a lot of trades last week that seemed extreme up or down based on what the results were. We're not talking about Uber today, but Uber had a really big fall because they missed their gross bookings guide, but they've missed that a lot of times. So I think you have to factor that in a little bit to how the shares traded, but I do think we're definitely past the honeymoon phase of the AI hype and investors want to see more meat on the bone. Jeremy Owens: And we did get some of that meat. Amazon, while they didn't say the exact number, they did say they are on a multi-billion revenue run rate with AI, so a little bit more generic. We have to figure most of that is cloud. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. Amazon doesn't have really a strong, what we call a SaaS or an apps business like Office, Excel, all those Microsoft has, so a lot of their stuff is really under the hood stuff that companies are using. I think that's going to be honestly a harder thing for them to break out longer term, how much of that is being used by AI companies for compute versus other companies using AI-generated tools? It'll be interesting to see what they do with that longer term, because Amazon historically doesn't like to give a lot of specific breakouts. Think about all the years they've sold the Kindle reader. They've never made a quarterly disclosure of how many Kindles they sold, even way back when that was their first device and there was an interest in doing it. They just didn't do that. So I think with them, I don't see a line item coming. Jeremy Owens: What I take away from a lot of these reports, Dan, is that investors are now looking at these companies' core businesses again instead of focusing on general AI chatter. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And the funny thing with Amazon was that they got a bounce even though they did the biggest CapEx jump of any of the companies, and it was shocking actually to see the number they spent in the third quarter relative to what expectations were. There was a lot of interesting dynamics with them because in their last quarter, they had teased the fact that, because they're also doing the satellite program, these satellites to compete with Starlink that are going to provide web-based services, and hinted that they were going to start having launch costs work into it. And so there was this growing worry on Wall Street saying, "Well, street estimates for earnings are too high because nobody's factoring in these costs." And Amazon's profit margins are really key to the appeal because they've been going up and up and up the last few years, so I think the fact that their margins came in and stayed strong and their forecast for margins was really strong, which it generally is not, they usually give themselves a huge wiggle room there, that was enough to kind of boost them even past a huge CapEx jump. And even with a kind of fuzzy AI disclosure, it was good enough. Jeremy Owens: Yeah. And you bring up profit margins, the Big Tech's profit margins are driving the S&P 500's profit margins higher. Since the layoffs in late 2022, early '23, the Big Tech private margins have just gotten bigger, and we continue to see evidence of this. And you brought up in one of your articles about the earnings last week about Google, where they brought on, I think, 1700 new employees in the third quarter, which seems like a really big total until you look at Google's history. And they had averaged about 7,000 new employees for the third quarter over the past five years. And then hearing Google also say that 25% of its coding is now being done by AI. This just continues to hit for me that Big Tech is trying to put themselves together in a way that it shows their corporate customers what they can do. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And I think the timing works out well for them in that sense too. They lagged behind. We saw Meta do this big year of efficiency back in late '22, mostly '23, that they fired a lot of people, their revenue per employee went up, the stock really took off, and Google was lagging on that. They just didn't show any sign that they were going to do something that drastic. And so the fact that they have shown now that they're watching their cost, getting the efficiency help, maybe not with as drastic a number as Meta delivered, it's good for them. And then yeah, the timing with the fact that they have these AI tools now at a certain phase of development where they can be used like that is definitely, I think, going to help them. Jeremy Owens: But with Google, it is an advertising business. They actually do have enterprise, so they can make that pitch. Meta is the one, and I still call them Facebook, but Facebook also is a advertising company. Dan Gallagher: Even more so than Google. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, yeah, exactly. People want to talk about their social networks or whatever else they do, but these companies sell ads. That's how they make money. And both their ad businesses are going bonkers good right now. And Zuckerberg talks about the ad business, and obviously AI is helping their ads business, but I still don't understand what the business case is for all the AI spend he's doing. He promised to continue spending money on AI gear, and I just don't see where the money is for Facebook from AI besides better ad tools. Dan Gallagher: I think that's one big part of the appeal with it, especially when you consider that their core advertising business is now getting operating margins of like 50%-plus. Basically, right now, they're still in a phase where they can get away with a certain amount, because they show that they can do a pretty harsh turn. Let's go back to this Metaverse thing, the market brutally punished them when they said, "We're going to change our name and spend all this money to build a metaverse," and nobody understood what it was, and the market rebelled. And I'll give Zuckerberg a little credit here, he saw what happened and made a pretty hard pivot and said, "Okay, well, we're done with that." Not necessarily done, they still have- Jeremy Owens: No, he still doesn't say that. Dan Gallagher: They made a hard pivot in terms of the kind of things they were spending, the employee footprint they had. They made some pretty drastic changes quickly, which I think impressed a lot of investors. So I think they get a fair amount of benefit of the doubt right now. A year from now, if they're still spending this kind of amounts but the margin growth and everything has slowed, do they still get that or do they have more people asking exactly what you're asking, "What's the future upside of this?" It's probably not going to come from $300 glasses. Jeremy Owens: Right. Dan Gallagher: But if people took those up in a wide number and then got comfortable with things like AI and hardware, and started to be open to the fact of spending on services, there's potential there. Meta is not a company that's like, "We're going to be in the glasses business." For them, the glasses are a vehicle to get their technology into consumers' hands. Jeremy Owens: We're going to take a quick break. Coming up, can Apple find a generative AI payday, and what does all this mean for NVIDIA? Welcome back. Let's get into Apple earnings and the iPhone's AI debut. I think Wall Street is coming to the realization that AI is not a 2024 story. It's really a late 2025 story at best, at this point, and I think the best example of that is Apple. Apple brought out its Apple Intelligence last week. It actually released the program, which you need either this year's iPhone or last year's iPhone to access. And then they gave their earnings and forecast basically flat iPhone sales for this holiday season. It's basically admitting this is a late 2025 story if it actually does come around, and generative AI is a consumer product that makes consumers want to spend money. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. And I think even that's iffy at the moment, just given the fact that so far, AI-enabled devices have not proved big sellers. Consumers are not yet sold on this idea that they need a device with onboard AI capabilities like the iPhone, like the Samsung phone, like these PCs we're seeing. So I think for Apple, it's this Apple Intelligence launch, but not everything is going to be in it. So the stuff they showed off over the summer, that's slowly coming over the next year. So if you're a prospective iPhone buyer and your current device is working fine and you're thinking, well, maybe this AI thing's worth it, you're going to wait. Apple always has this base of fans that are anxious to get the new thing whenever it comes out, but more of them, especially at the price these phones are even without an AI surcharge, these are expensive phones. And historically, the things that have really sparked these super cycles are when there's a big hardware change, when the screen gets bigger, when they started the Pro models and had these much fancier cameras. You've seen things like that spike. And you also have the fact that people hold onto their phones longer, so if you've had a big uptick one year and those people hold on of their phone for let's say three years, four years, then you're going to have a naturally bigger uptick. But we haven't seen a lot of cases where software alone has sparked any kind of super cycle, and that was the "what if" coming into this, like even if Apple Intelligence was amazing, was that going to really drive people to do it? Jeremy Owens: I want to get to my general takeaways, and the first one's really easy and simple. NVIDIA is still fine. All these executives got on their earnings calls and said, "Hey, we're going to keep spending money for all this AI gear," and that was just music to Jensen Huang's ears. Dan Gallagher: Totally. If only Amazon had done their increase with the amount they increased, NVIDIA would be fine. Jeremy Owens: Right, right. Dan Gallagher: That was such a huge increase. But yes, they're all spending more. Jeremy Owens: Well, NVIDIA is going to replace Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, big move. NVIDIA coming into Intel shows the Dow trying to represent what is the market today. Dan Gallagher: The interesting risk with switching NVIDIA for Intel... Obviously Intel is greatly diminished, having a lot of trouble, like its days were numbered. That was clear. But when this conversation first came up earlier this year, I thought, well, there's some risks with NVIDIA, because technically, NVIDIA has multiple businesses because they were historically a video game chip company. Data center business grew up because companies were wanting those chips in their data centers. Well, it's pretty much all AI at the moment. Intel PCs were their dominant business, but it's not as dominant in Intel's model as it is in NVIDIA's. So in a way, NVIDIA is going to be always a little more of a volatile name because at some point when AI spending rationalizes and companies start to say, "Okay, well, we're going to not grow it as much," you're going to see NVIDIA stock may get really volatile, because right now, it just trades on this assumption that the spending's going up in a huge way. But it's going to be interesting to see how the effect plays out, especially in the years ahead as NVIDIA's business reaches like, what's maybe a new normal? How does the stock behave? I think it's going to go through some wild gyrations. Jeremy Owens: On the other side, and this was always something I thought about this technology but I'm just more baked in now that this is an enterprise technology and not really a consumer technology yet. And so that's good for Microsoft, Amazon and Google, which do sell enterprise generative AI products and cloud and software, while Meta and Apple are a little bit more questionable for me moving forward just on how they make money off of this. Dan Gallagher: I think so. But I think of Meta though not necessarily as consumer or enterprise, because remember, most of Meta's money is coming from businesses who are paying to advertise. So as long as they see value, and if generative AI makes Meta an even better advertising tool, they're going to be fine. For Apple, it's really tricky because if Apple's going to get AI into people's hands, it has to happen through their hardware. But the good news for NVIDIA, it doesn't matter what happens with Apple. Jeremy Owens: No, as long as Microsoft, Amazon, and Zuckerberg keep on spending- Dan Gallagher: Exactly. Jeremy Owens: ... they're fine. And so lastly, it feels like we've entered a new cycle in this AI hype era. It seemed like last year, all you had to do was say, "AI," your stock went up. This year, investors wanted numbers, and they've gotten a few more numbers or at least more specifics. And now we've reached this place where even a very specific big AI number for Microsoft did not help because everybody was looking at the traditional businesses. And it seems like a golden era for these Big Tech companies, to me. They've got good finances, they've got good core businesses, and they've still got this promise of AI returns in the future. And so they're sitting here, and I don't know how they go higher from here, but I also don't know how they get cut off at the knees, because they have that magic formula that Wall Street loves. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. So I think we're going to see this next year, is they're going to be fine on their core businesses. I think we're going to enter a phase where everything needs to go right. If you have an earnings report that's pretty strong on the core but the AI stuff isn't impressing, your stock's probably not going to do well, and the vice versa. You need to deliver both, because when you're spending this kind of money, you do need to show return at some point. They're not going broke, any of them, but this is a lot of money going out the door, and the questions are just going to keep growing and growing. Jeremy Owens: So enjoy this time now, Mark and Satya, and all you other executives who had such a good run this earnings season, because next year you're going to have to bring good core performance and AI evidence, and it still may not be enough. We'll see what the AI evidence shows- Dan Gallagher: Just do it all. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, yeah- Dan Gallagher: That's all you got to do- Jeremy Owens: Just do it all for us. Yeah, you're worth trillions of dollars. You got to show up for it. Well, Dan, thank you so much for what you do, and thank you so much for joining us here on On Watch. Dan Gallagher: Well, thanks for having me. Jeremy Owens: Before we go, it's time for what we are watching, a look at the news you need to know for the rest of the week and beyond. Tuesday's election went Republicans' way with Donald Trump winning the presidency and the GOP retaking the Senate. There are a lot of implications here for the economy and the market, from the effects of mass deportations to the likelihood of friendly rules for the cryptocurrency industry. We'll be back to discuss those issues and more in depth next week. The October jobs report came in last Friday and it was disappointing, with only 12,000 new jobs added. While that number was much lower than expected, it really shouldn't have been too surprising. Two hurricanes and a massive strike at Boeing dragged down a month that is typically big for hiring. Despite those underlying factors, the jobs report still reflects a labor market that is not strong. The Federal Reserve has certainly been discussing that jobs report in its meeting, which began yesterday and will run through today. The board is expected to cut another 25 basis points from its core interest rate and Chairman Jerome Powell will face the press today to discuss the decision. And that's it for this episode.

Title: Justices skeptical about Facebook’s data breach disclosure to investors

The justices heard arguments Wednesday in Facebook v. Amalgamated Bank, their first securities case of the year. The case involves the 2015 Cambridge Analytica-Facebook data breach, and considers whether Facebook’s disclosures to investors before the breach was public improperly downplayed the risks that data breaches posed to the company and its stock price. Shareholders sued Facebook in 2018 after they learned that Cambridge Analytica had obtained the personal data of 30 million Facebook users. The shareholders conted that Facebook misled them about the risks to their investment. Although some justices seemed more receptive to the argument of Kannon Shanmugam (representing Facebook), the dominant tone was skepticism. The headwinds started in the first minutes of the argument, with Justice Clarence Thomas offering an off-hand assessment that “a reasonable person” would assume from a statement like Facebook’s that nothing bad of this sort ever had happened to it. Shanmugam quickly faced similar perspectives from Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, who compared Facebook’s disclosures to a homeowner suggesting that crime might be a risk to values in the future without mentioning a string of recent burglaries in the neighborhood. To the casual observer, there are not a lot of five-justice majorities that skip over those three justices. That’s not to say that it was all bad for Facebook. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh were the most reluctant to accept this as enough to justify a class action against Facebook. For Roberts, Facebook’s disclosure was more like a statement that you should be careful about walking down his front steps, because you might fall – a statement from which you might infer that somebody had fallen in the past. For him, the subjectivity of determining what a factfinder might infer from any particular disclosure made it “kind of a blank check” to “go to trial to decide” how to interpret the disclosure. In the same vein, Kavanaugh thought it central that the Securities and Exchange Commission already has rules that require companies explicitly to disclose lots of adverse past events in various disclosures – and this is not on the list. For him, it makes no sense for “the judiciary … to walk the plank on this … when the SEC could do it.” As he put it, “[t]he SEC knows how to write regulations that require disclosure of past events. … Why not let the SEC do this if they want to?” Past experience suggests it is hard to imagine a unanimous Supreme Court affirming a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit expanding liability under the securities laws, so I certainly would not want to overread the argument. What I would say is this was not a compelling day for Meta. We’ll have to wait for the opinions in the spring to see what they actually decide.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks held onto gains as investors digested a fresh interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve and Donald Trump's electoral victory. In a widely expected move, the Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points on Thursday, lowering its benchmark rate to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up than 1.3% as shares of chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) rose to new highs. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) traded right around the flat line, on the heels of a 1,500-point gain that marked the blue-chip gauge's best day since 2022. Spirits still appeared buoyant after Trump's presidential election win, which sent all three major stock gauges soaring to fresh record highs on Wednesday. His plans for corporate tax cuts and deregulation have fueled optimism for a boost to the economy that will feed into stocks. The Fed's interest rate decision later Thursday could be the next catalyst that moves markets. Aside from the rate cut, the focus is on what Chair Jerome Powell might reveal about the future path of policy, especially as Trump's return could mean rates stay higher for longer. On the corporate front, Arm Holdings (ARM) stock rose about 4% after amid a broader tech rally despite the chip designer's revenue forecast disappointing Wall Street's hopes for stronger, AI-powered growth. Peer Qualcomm's (QCOM) shares were near flat after its sales and profit outlooks topped estimates. Meanwhile, Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) continued to pull back from the big spike that followed the election result. Shares in the company — the home of Trump's social media platform, Truth Social — fell by double digits during the session. The Fed's next policy decision is less than 30 minutes away. Here's a look at where markets sit before Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's closely followed press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was up 0.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up than 1.2% as shares of chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) rose to new highs. Broadly, big tech led the market action with all of the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks up more than 1% on the day, led by more than 3% pop in Meta (META). In bonds, a recent move higher in yields took a breather, with the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) falling about 7 basis points to 4.35%. Below is a look at the sector action for the day where Information Technology (XLK) is leading the way. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points Thursday and avoid any unnecessary surprises less than two days after the election of Donald Trump as the next president. "They'd rather just cut, keep their heads down and not say anything all that new," said Luke Tilley, chief economist for Wilmington Trust. Still, that doesn’t mean the discussion today in Washington will necessarily be a smooth one. Fed policymakers will have to make sense of recent data indicating a strong economy, persistent inflation, and a muddled jobs market disrupted by weather and worker strikes. And there could be a debate between those who want to cut, those who could support a pause, and those who would support a cut combined with language designed to communicate a more gradual approach to future reductions. Read more here. The stock market's feverish rally following Donald Trump's presidential election victory may have just been an early appetizer for a strong few months of gains. "Exuberance lies ahead," Julian Emanuel, who leads the equity, derivatives, and quantitative strategy team at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday night. "President-Elect Trump will move fast on policy initiatives, and stocks will move fast in response." Emanuel, who already had a 6,000 call on the S&P 500 for 2024, now sees the S&P 500 hitting 6,600 by the end of June 2025, about an 11% increase from its current level. A "public reengaged in speculation," as evidenced by Wednesday's market action with bitcoin (BTC-USD) hitting 76,000 for the first time and Tesla (TSLA) stock soaring 14%, could help drive the benchmark index higher, per Emanuel. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Mortgage rates rose for a sixth consecutive week, following Treasury yields as they climbed higher through the presidential election. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 6.79% through Wednesday, up from 6.72% a week earlier, according to Freddie Mac data. The average 15-year fixed-rate mortgage was essentially unchanged, to 6% from 5.99%. Mortgage rates typically mirror 10-year Treasury yields, which rose quickly in recent weeks as traders grew increasingly confident that former President Donald Trump would win Tuesday’s election and implement inflationary policies like tariffs. Read more here. About 24 hours after Donald Trump won the presidential election, American CEOs are already weighing on how the president-elect's policies could impact their business. For one, Trump's proposed increases on tariffs are expected to weigh on retailers. On Wednesday, Steve Madden (SHOO) CEO Edward Rosenfeld said his company has been “planning for a potential scenario in which we would have to move goods out of China more quickly.” “Our goal over the next year is to reduce that percentage of goods that we sourced from China by approximately 40% to 45%, which means that if we’re able to achieve that and we think we have the plan to do it, that a year from today, we would be looking at just over a quarter of our business that would be subject to potential tariffs on Chinese goods,” the shoemaker's CEO said. Trump's presidency is also expected to be less restrictive on mergers and acquisitions. Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) CEO David Zaslav said Thursday Trump's second term could provide an opportunity for more consolidation in the media industry. "We have an upcoming new administration, and it's too early to tell, but it may offer a pace of change and an opportunity for consolidation that may be quite different," Zaslav said on a call with analysts following the company's third quarter results. Raymond James analysts on Thursday downgraded shares of DHI (DHI), saying that in the wake of Trump's election win, they view mortgage rates staying “higher for longer” and constraining housing affordability. The investment firm downgraded DHI to Market Perform from Outperform but kept the same price target at $195.00. It lowered its fiscal year 2025 EPS estimates to $13.25 from $15.80 and projects an EPS estimate of $15.00 in the fiscal year of 2026. Due to “the near-term pressures we see on entry level homebuilders, whose core first-time buyers are likely to face even greater affordability challenges this spring,” Buck Horne, director at Raymond James & Associates, wrote in a note to clients. "Coming out of a volatile October, DHI was already facing pressure from a more competitive inventory environment, rising rates, and buyers’ election anxiety,” Horne added. The bearish call comes as DHI reported weaker-than-expected home orders for its fiscal fourth quarter as high mortgage rates dampened buyer affordability. Netflix (NFLX) stock has surged to another all-time high as tech rallies after Donald Trump clinched victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election. The stock is currently trading above $790 a share and has climbed more than 60% since the start of the year, with 10% gains over the past month — far outpacing broader markets. The moves higher extend beyond the recent Trump-fueled rally, however, as Netflix stands out among a list of battered media sector names. The streamer has added more than 50 million paying subscribers since launching its password crackdown in May 2023. Its projected full-year operating margins are expected to hit 27%, with management hinting the company has the potential to eventually secure margins similar to broadcast networks, which historically have been in the range of 40% to 50%. And in the first three quarters of 2024, Netflix pulled in roughly $6.9 billion in net income. Its competitors aren't even close. Disney (DIS) and Paramount Global (PARA) just reported their first quarter of profits in their respective streaming businesses earlier this summer. A shift for the industry, yes, but not a cure-all for the problems that have plagued traditional media, with Comcast (CMCSA) the most recent company to weigh spinning off its cable networks. "Netflix is clearly running away with the ball and the media-based streaming companies are struggling to even get on the field," Barton Crockett, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities, previously told Yahoo Finance. Read more about Netflix's dominance here and why analysts say it's won the hard-fought streaming wars. Lyft (LYFT) shares soared more than 25% after its third quarter earnings beat expectations. Lyft’s adjusted earnings per share of $0.29 were ahead of the $0.20 expected, while quarterly revenue of $1.5 billion beat Wall Street’s estimate of $1.4 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Rides for the period ended Sept. 30 totaled 217 million, above the 213 million expected. On Wednesday, Lyft announced partnerships with autonomous vehicle companies as it looks to secure a foothold in the burgeoning market, adding driverless cabs to its network in Atlanta in 2025. Wall Street analysts in notes to investors Thursday gave kudos to Lyft’s expansions beyond ride-hailing. “LYFT is no longer a ride-hailing pure-play with it now embarking on partnerships in food delivery and AVs,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst and Lyft bull Brad Erickson. Lyft recently unveiled a partnership with DoorDash (DASH). Still, analysts overall maintained Neutral ratings on the stock, with Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt, writing, “[W]e wait for clear evidence of a more sustainable growth trajectory for the business.” Lyft shares are up 74% from last year but far below highs in the $60 range in 2021. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly touched new highs just north of $76,000, extending gains from Wednesday's monster rally following Donald Trump's White House win. The cryptocurrency jumped to new records on Wednesday and crypto-related stocks also rose following the presidential election results. Over the summer Trump promised to make the US the crypto capital of the world and form a 'strategic bitcoin stockpile.' Shares of AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) each gained more than 1% on Thursday, extending gains from Wednesday's monster rally following Donald Trump's White House victory. Both stocks closed at all-time record highs on Wednesday. Earlier this week Nvidia surpassed iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) as the largest company in the world. The artificial intelligence chipmaker is expected to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) on Friday, replacing semiconductor giant Intel (INTC). Meanwhile, Amazon stock has been in an upward trend after the company posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly result last week. On Thursday, shares were trading just above $210 each. Another batch of companies reported earnings Thursday morning. Moderna (MRNA) jumped 5% at the market open as its earnings beat expectations partly thanks to better-than-anticipated COVID vaccine sales. Warner Bros. (WBD) jumped 10% thanks to streaming growth as Max subscribers soared. Meanwhile, Hershey (HSY) fell more than 1% after sinking as much as 3% premarket as high cocoa prices cut into its sales outlook for the year. Here’s a closer look at how the companies performed: Hershey: Adjusted earnings per share of $2.34 vs. $2.56 per share expected, revenue of $2.99 billion vs. $3.07 billion expected Moderna: Earnings per share of $0.03 vs. a loss of $1.98 per share expected, revenue of $1.86 billion vs. $1.25 billion expected Warner Bros.: Adjusted earnings per share of $0.05 vs. a loss of $0.12 per share expected, revenue of $9.62 billion vs. $9.81 billion expected Meanwhile, energy companies traded flattish after showing mixed results as natural disasters impacted some of their businesses. Duke Energy (DUK) saw its profits hit by hurricane costs, while Pacific Gas & Electric (PCG) missed on revenue just as it shut off power in Northern California amid fire risks. Nuclear power provider Vistra soared 11% after an earnings beat as it recovers from earlier losses. Stocks extended their gains on Thursday following a monster rally on the heels of Donald Trump's White House victory. The move higher in stocks comes ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) inched up 0.1% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up 0.5% after all three major averages closed at record highs on Wednesday. As Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points and avoid any unnecessary surprises after the election of Trump as the next president. Meanwhile, parts of the "Trump Trade" showed some signs of unwinding on Thursday as Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) sank by double digits, reversing the gains it enjoyed in the prior session. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) sank by double digits in premarket trading on Thursday, reversing the gains it enjoyed on Wednesday as Donald Trump clinched victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election. As Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal reports, shares in the company — the home of Trump's social media platform, Truth Social — have been on a wild ride over the past week, with the up-and-down moves mostly tied to Trump's chances of reclaiming the White House. The stock is down about 10% over the past five days, although shares have rallied nearly 120% in the past month. Read more here. Initial jobless claims jumped to 221,000 last week, an increase of 3,000 from the previous week's revised level, according to data released by the US Department of Labor on Thursday morning. The previous week's level was revised up by 2,000 from 216,000 to 218,000. Meanwhile, continuing claims came in at 1,892,000, an increase of 39,000 from the previous week's revised level.

Title: The world’s best gaming CPU launches today – here’s where to find the 9800X3D

Enthusiasts take note; the new best CPU for gaming is out, but it's selling fast. Here's what you need to know. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The much-anticipated Ryzen 7 9800X3D has officially launched following months of rumors and speculation. It comes on the heels of AMD's standard Ryzen 9000 desktop chips, released in August 2024, which Senior Editor Ben Wilson favorably reviewed. Wilson also reviewed the new Ryzen 7 9800X3D, calling it "the best gaming CPU" and handing it a Windows Central Best Award. That's despite a higher launch price (by $30) than the Ryzen 7 7800X3D predecessor, which is still available today. I'm still expecting to see more Ryzen 9000 X3D chips to launch in the future, but I'd be surprised if the 9800X3D doesn't remain the most popular choice for gamers for a long time. November 8, 9:10 AM EST: The Ryzen 7 9800X3D is back in stock at Amazon but remains unavailable at Newegg, Best Buy, and B&H Photo. Pre-built custom PCs featuring the chip are still available; details below. — Ben Wilson AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D AMD's new $479 Ryzen 7 9800X3D delivers a second-gen 3D V-Cache that pushes gaming performance beyond even the stellar Ryzen 7 7800X3D predecessor. If you want the absolute best processor for PC gaming, there's really no other option. 👉 Available at: Best Buy | Newegg | Amazon | B&H It shouldn't come as much of a surprise to anyone who's been following the latest Zen 5 rumors that the Ryzen 7 9800X3D has surpassed its predecessor to become the best new CPU for PC gamers. Senior Editor Ben Wilson tested the 9800X3D using an MSI MPG X870E Carbon WiFi motherboard, Liquid Freezer III 360 cooler, and G.Skill Trident Z5 Neo RGB DDR5 RAM. In his Ryzen 7 9800X3D review, he stated: "Make no mistake: the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best gaming CPU, politely dethroning its predecessor as the new king of the hill as a cache-heavy monster. However, it's not winning any awards for productivity. It isn't worth installing into a PC that spends most of its time crunching numbers in Microsoft Office and Teams since the 9900X and 9950X dominate that category, but it's a far better pick for gamers than anything from Intel's modern productivity-centric offerings. Unfortunately, those who'll benefit most will need to spend a sizeable amount of cash on a new motherboard and RAM upgrades, making the 9800X3D MSRP hike sting a little more than a cute $30. Nevertheless, this is the new meta for PC gaming, and nothing else can challenge its ability to deliver monstrous FPS counts if you can pair it with a capable GPU to enjoy the latest AAA titles loaded with visual luxuries." All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Like the predecessor Ryzen 7 7800X3D, this is a processor intended mainly for gaming. Its productivity scores, as Wilson states, aren't exceptional, falling behind even the Core Ultra 5 245K in a bunch of productivity benchmarks. Here's a look at the results. As expected, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D's performance absolutely shines in games. As you can see below, it pulls far ahead of Intel's latest Core Ultra 9 285K flagship in demanding games. That's despite the Core Ultra 9 having more cores, more threads, a higher clock speed, and a higher TDP. Wilson also pulled a bunch of real-world benchmarks from the games listed in the chart above for a better idea of where performance lies. These are some of the most demanding games out there right now, but it's clear that the Ryzen 7 9800X3D has no problems running them. Standout metrics include the Ryzen 7 9800X3D reaching a 52% performance increase in Cyberpunk 2077, as well as a 43% increase to performance in Far Cry 6. Even the new Call of Duty Black Ops 6 hits a 41% increase compared to Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D is undoubtedly tempting for any serious PC gamers. I know I've had my eye on the new chip since rumors began, and based on the positive reviews I plan on putting together a PC upgrade plan. • Best Xbox/PC headsets• Best Windows laptops• Best laptops w/ num pads• Best Xbox storage• Best sim racing PCs• Best ROG Ally accessories• Best gaming laptops I'm coming from a Ryzen 7 5800X chip, which is now a few generations old. In fact, it's using an older AM4 motherboard socket and DDR4 RAM, which means I'll need to upgrade the motherboard and memory when I make the chip change. If you're working with a Ryzen 5000 chip, you'll need to do the same. Whether or not that makes financial sense right now only you can say. If you are looking to upgrade to the new Zen 5 chip, have a look at top motherboards for the Ryzen 7 9800X3D to get you started. If you're already working with a Ryzen 7 7800X3D, chances are you don't see much need to upgrade to the 9800X3D. Your upgrade path will be easier due to the 7800X3D using the AM5 socket and DDR5 RAM, but the $479 MSRP for the 9800X3D no doubt seems a bit steep when your 7800X3D is still so potent. Here's a quick look at the Ryzen 9800X3D and 7800X3D specifications. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D is now available for purchase at major online retailers like Best Buy, Newegg, B&H, and Amazon. You're looking at the same $479 launch price across retailers, and that's expected to stick for the time being. It's always within the realm of possibility that the new CPU will drop in price for Black Friday or Cyber Monday if there's any stock left to discount. If you're buying at launch, here are the retailers currently offering the chip at $479. I'm expecting to see plenty of pre-built gaming PCs have the Ryzen 7 9800X3D as a centerpiece, but at the time of the chip's launch, your options are limited. With the standalone CPUs now sold out everywhere I look, a pre-built might be your next best option. I first spotted a couple of custom PCs from iBuyPower. There are set models starting at $2,099, but you can configure them with a ton of different hardware centered around the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. The lowest price I could configure was $1,346, and there's almost no limit to what you can add if your budget allows. iBuyPower AMD Ryzen X3D Pro A massive collection of configuration options allows you to build your PC from the screws up, and it's all centered around the new AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU. 👉 See at iBuyPower.com CyberPowerPC is so far the only other builder I spotted featuring the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. There are six pre-builts available at the time of writing, each with a different case and liquid cooler. Prices start at $1,685 for the 9800X3D, RTX 4060 Ti GPU, 32GB DDR5 RAM, and 1TB M.2 PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD. 👉 See CyberPowerPC's Ryzen 7 9800X3D pre-built PCs Yes, the predecessor Ryzen 7 7800X3D is still available to buy. It is, however, more expensive now than it was at launch. In some countries, including Canada where I'm located, it's practically impossible to find. That's a testament to its lasting power and popularity. With the best price I can find hovering around $476 at Amazon — or around $570 at Newegg and Walmart — you might as well buy the newer Ryzen 7 9800X3D for about the same price. My recommendation changes if the price of the 7800X3D suddenly drops following the 9800X3D launch. There's also Black Friday and Cyber Monday heading our way in a few weeks, which is usually a great opportunity to save significantly on PC parts and upgrades. AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D AMD's Ryzen 7 7800X3D remains a killer option for gamers, though its popularity has caused prices to spike in the lead-up to the Ryzen 7 9800X3D's launch. If prices should fall below those of the newer chip, I strongly recommend it as an alternative. The best price at the time of writing is at Amazon ($476). 👉 Available at: Amazon | Walmart | Newegg Cale Hunt brings to Windows Central more than eight years of experience writing about laptops, PCs, accessories, games, and beyond.

Nvidia, a leading American software company, reclaims the title of the world’s most valuable company by market capitalization, topping tech giant Apple. The company’s shares jumped by 2.5% during Tuesday’s trading hours, pushing its market valuation to roughly $3.44 trillion, topping Apple’s $3.37 trillion. The world’s most valuable companies, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple, have been contesting the “world’s most valuable company” tag for most of the year. However, Nvidia was the year’s surprise story thanks to its investment in chips that power the Artificial Intelligence technology. Nvidia has been bolstered by the 850% growth in the AI and machine learning space and the growth of AI-based coins. As the company enjoys an increased demand for its chips, other AI coins like the Internet Computer, the NEAR protocol, Bittensor, Injective, and Artificial Superintelligence Alliance have enjoyed their respective surges too. Nvidia overtakes Apple as world’s most valuable company https://t.co/chWMKMofPL pic.twitter.com/Zfqa4PBYcu — CNA (@ChannelNewsAsia) October 25, 2024 Last September 6th, Nvidia’s price was just $102.83 but soon started to climb thanks to increasing demand for its chips. At the heart of its operations are the AI chips that power many large language models today. According to Fall Ainina of James Investment Research, Nvidia’s current position is linked to machine learning and generative AI industry growth. Thanks to its role in advancing AI technology, the company’s stock has increased by over 850% since 2022. The company supplies chips to top tech companies such as Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and even Microsoft. Analysts expect the company’s revenues to beat the company’s estimates, with an additional 44% growth next year. Nvidia’s impressive performance this year can be attributed to the demand for its chips and the growth in AI coins. For example, there’s NEAR protocol, which jumped by 5.40%. It’s currently priced at $3.81, with over $222 million in 24-hour trading volume. Internet Computer is another AI coin that’s surging, adding 5% to its market value, with a market volume of $57 million. Plenty of AI coins are joining the tech firm’s market rally. Bittensor is now trading at $482, and Artificial Superintelligence is rising to $1.25, reflecting an increase of 10.96%. Nvidia’s growing market cap and the continuing popularity of AI coins highlight AI’s increasing influence. Some of the top Wall Street companies, such as Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet, are now working with the company to expand their AI capabilities. Market analysts expect the company and AI coins to sustain their rally in the short term. As of this writing, Nvidia accounts for 7% of the US S&P 500 Index weight. It’s also crucial to note that AI stocks like Nvidia are some of the performing stocks for the year.

The net worths of many of the world’s wealthiest people skyrocketed Thursday, particularly those with strong ties to cryptocurrency, with stocks soaring following Donald Trump’s election win as the president-elect is expected to embrace cryptocurrency and corporate tax cuts during his upcoming term. Musk is one of Trump's most wealthy backers. (Photo by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images) Elon Musk: The Tesla chief, who was one of Trump’s biggest financial backers in the lead-up to the election, experienced a nearly $21 billion jolt to his net worth Wednesday, bringing it to $285.6 billion as Tesla’s stock closed up nearly 15% on Wednesday at $288.53—its highest share price recorded this year. Jeff Bezos: Bezos’ net worth is up $7 billion to $223.5 billion after a strong day of trading for Amazon shares (up 3.8%), maintaining his position as the world’s second-wealthiest person behind Musk. Larry Ellison: The Oracle co-founder is nearly $12 billion richer, as his net worth jumped to $220.8 billion and lessened the gap between him and Bezos for No. 2 on Forbes’ billionaire list. Warren Buffett: The world-renowned investor’s net worth spiked $7.6 billion Wednesday, bringing it to $147.4 billion, with Berkshire Hathaway rising more than 5%. Brian Armstrong: Armstrong, the CEO of crypto platform Coinbase, has an estimated $11 billion net worth after a $2.6 billion increase Wednesday, the result of a whopping 31% surge for Coinbase as it closed at $254.31 (the platform’s co-founder, Fred Ehrsam, became $600 million richer as markets closed). Vlad Tenev & Baiju Bhatt: The Robinhood co-founders’ net worths climbed together, with Bhatt’s up $307 million to $1.9 billion and Tenev’s up nearly $300 million to $1.9 billion, as well (Robinhood shares surged almost 20% Wednesday). Michael Saylor: Saylor, the founder of bitcoin strategy firm MicroStrategy, became nearly $600 million richer as his estimated net worth climbed to $6.6 billion while the company’s stock swelled 13% to $257.81—one of its highest points of the year.

Meta co-founder Mark Zuckerberg did not join in on the rush, as he experienced a small drop in net worth to $197.9 billion and kept his place as the fourth-wealthiest person in the world behind Ellison. Meta shares ended the trading day at $572.05—down $0.38. Bitcoin reached an all-time high Wednesday, skyrocketing past the $76,000 mark in reaction to Trump’s electoral victory. Businesses and crypto-related stocks are likely reacting positively to the election results because Trump has positioned himself as a “crypto president” and promised tax cuts to prominent CEOs including Apple’s Tim Cook and JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon. Cryptocurrency investors also believe his presidency will be favorable for crypto regulations, as Trump said this year he aims to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet”—a full reversal from the doubts and criticisms he levied at cryptocurrency years ago.

Nvidia is now worth more than Meta and Amazon combined. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The AI hype is in full throttle, as Nvidia is now the largest company in the world by market cap. With a market capitalization of $3.52 trillion, Nvidia has effectively dethroned Apple for the second time this year. This news follows developments in the stock market, with Nvidia's shares surging by 2.72% this morning. All top leaders had a bullish start to the day, but a 0.64% uptick wasn't enough for Apple to hold off the green storm. Nvidia now stands as the world's largest company by market cap, but will it be able to defend its position? If so, for how long? A deeper dive into Nvidia's stock shows that just one year ago, its market cap stood at roughly $1.1 trillion, netting us a 214% increase in the stock price within just 365 days. This is genuinely unprecedented growth, most of which can be attributed to Nvidia's ventures in the AI market as the chipmaker's accelerators continue to fuel the hype train. Q2 24 earnings show that Nvidia's revenue rose by 141% QOQ, increasing to $10.3 billion in data centers, while gaming was a measly 11% at $2.5 billion. With virtually every company planning to get a piece of the AI pie, they still require chips specifically tailored for Artificial Intelligence training and inference. Nvidia's latest Blackwell-based B100 and B200 GPUs are reportedly sold out for the next 12 months. Companies revolving around AI, such as OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, you name it, are all in an arms race to procure the latest chips from Nvidia. AMD's CDNA3-based MI325X and the upcoming CDNA4-based MI355X could shake things up somewhat. For the time being, companies might still be inclined to prefer Nvidia due to its better software stack; however, more competition is good for evsuitablene - even multi-trillion-dollar conglomerates. The question boils down to mass-scale production since data centers and supercomputers require 10,000 to 100,000 GPUs, so it ultimately depends on whether either company can fulfill the required demand within the required time. These have been two very eventful years for not just Nvidia but its CEO, Jensen Huang, who is set to receive an honorary doctorate in engineering. Financially, consumer GPUs seem to be an afterthought for Nvidia, although leaks suggest that Nvidia is eying a January 2025 reveal for the much-anticipated RTX 50 series.

Thankfully, most gamers do not care about the benchmark-breaking number crunching as long as they get their framerate boosts, and the Ryzen 7 9800X3D delivers that sweet extra FPS. It's not a big enough jump to tempt those happy with a previous-gen Ryzen 7 7800X3D, but anyone on Ryzen 5000 chips or jumping ship from Intel will love it if the $30 MSRP hike and AM5 overhauls don't sour the temptation. Crushes Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K in gaming with a cheaper cost Compatible with most AM5 CPU coolers without new adapters Around 8-22% of generational performance increases Upgrading from 5000X3D means all-new motherboards and DDR5 RAM $30 more expensive than its Ryzen 7 7800X3D predecessor 7800X3D users could wait for the next generation with bigger gains Why you can trust Windows Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. I can tell you that extra cores and threads benefit raw productivity performance, but I'll always feel the temptation of a gaming-centric CPU that delivers boosted framerates, something AMD has repeatedly delivered with its -X3D chips. • Price and availability• CPU benchmarks• Gaming benchmarks• Competition• Should you buy? It's a simple fact that consistently proves itself with each processor generation: gamers want the best performance for their money and will take any desktop boosts as a convenient side effect. AMD has remained in the top-seller spot for most CPU retailers, with the previous-generation Ryzen 7 7800X3D sitting pretty as the gaming champion since its release. If that were ever to change, it'd be with a direct successor, and that's the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, here at last. While I've tested processors from both Intel and AMD, my personal PCs have always used AMD Ryzen chips for modern builds and even AMD Athlon 64 many years before that. I've watched them evolve and still choose them for myself. At its launch, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the only Zen 5 processor in AMD's Ryzen 9000X3D range. More variants, presumably (but so far unconfirmed) a 9900X3D and 9950X3D, are expected to follow. Price: $479 at Newegg Release: November 7, 2024 Cores: 8 Threads: 16 Base clock: 4.7GHz Max boost: Up to 5.2GHz L3 cache: 96MB Base TDP: 120W The Ryzen 7 9800X3D is an 8-core, 16-thread APU (SoC) running at a 120W base TDP like its predecessor, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D. Its specs are also similar to AMD's Ryzen 7 9700X chip, which runs at a lower TDP with a reduced L3 cache, focused on productivity rather than gaming. Officially launching with a $479 MSRP, which is $30 more expensive than the $449 Ryzen 7 7800X3D it replaces, actual store listings come relatively close with some minor inflation. AMD has moved from a 4nm process to 5nm via TSMC's foundry but remains on the same AM5 socket with compatible 9000X3D motherboards and supports the same CPU coolers as its previous-gen Zen 4 (7000 Series) chips. Upgrading from a Ryzen 7000X3D chip would be a straightforward process for enthusiasts. Still, it wouldn't provide as much of a performance leap as it would for those using a Ryzen 7 5800X3D or similar AM4 variants using now-incompatible DDR4 memory modules (RAM) as AM5 requires DDR5. AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D | $479 at Newegg The new Ryzen 7 9800X3D becomes the best gaming CPU you can buy, surpassing the current category champion and crushing its top-end Intel competitor. 👉See at: Best Buy | Newegg | Amazon | B&H Having previously tested AMD's Ryzen 7 7800X3D and Ryzen 8000 Series processors like the Ryzen 5 8600G and Ryzen 7 8700G, I already had access to a compatible AM5-socket motherboard with the ASUS ROG STRIX B650-A Gaming WiFi. However, AMD provided all-new samples to ensure compatibility with the latest BIOS software and EXPO-compatible RAM running at 6000MHz. Arctic sent its Liquid Freezer III 360mm AIO to help test a separate processor, but it still offers the best cooling performance here. MSI MPG X870E Carbon WiFi | $499.99 at Newegg MSI goes all-out with built-in Wi-Fi 7 support alongside 5G Ethernet LAN and 40Gb/s USB-C plus PCIe 5.0 support for storage and expansion cards. 👉See at: Newegg | Amazon ARCTIC Liquid Freezer III 360 | $90.08 at Amazon Consistently proving to be the most convenient and effective AIO cooler, the Liquid Freezer III works perfectly with AM5 with a straightforward installation. 👉See at: Amazon | Newegg G.SKILL Trident Z5 Neo RGB DDR5 32GB (2x16GB) 6000MHz CL28 (White) | $129.99 at Amazon G.SKILL naturally offers multiple variants of its DDR5-6000 RAM, including black and white variants, but this CL28 32GB kit works perfectly with the 9800X3D. 👉See at: Amazon | Newegg This review was made possible with review samples provided by G.SKILL, Samsung, and MSI via AMD alongside Arctic. The companies did not see the contents of the review before publishing. No matter what a processor was designed for, it always passes my usual gamut of synthetic benchmarks that test single-core and multi-core performance in various productivity tasks. As fun as it would be to skip right to the gaming tests, it's important to see where the Ryzen 7 9800X3D ranks among its peers in burst processing and longer, sustained stress tests. For burst processing tests in Geekbench 6, the 9800X3D scores above its lower-powered non-X3D sibling, the $359 Ryzen 7 9700X, in multi-core performance but below in single-core equivalents. In synthetic productivity benchmarks, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D performed around 21-22% faster than its predecessor, the 7800X3D. Of particular note is how far ahead Intel's $589 Core Ultra 9 285K pulls in multi-core tests, as by design, but there isn't much of a gap in the single-core category — remember this when I compare gaming performance next. Otherwise, there's about a 22% generational burst performance improvement over AMD's predecessor, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D. Sustained stress tests with Cinebench 2024 show a similar story, with the 9800X3D scoring slightly ahead of the Ryzen 7 9700X as before while creeping on the heels of Intel's $309 Core Ultra 5 245K. In the long run, single-core performance falls in favor of Intel, with more of a lead gained by the Core Ultra 9 285K as it once again places miles ahead in multi-core equivalents, dominating productivity by a colossal degree. Again, a 21% generational sustained performance over the 7800X3D matches the burst tests. In its official documentation for the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, AMD touts an average 8% performance improvement in gaming compared to the previous-gen Ryzen 7 7800X3D. The amount depends on a range of engine-specific quirks that determine how CPU-bound or GPU-bound a title can be, though the percentage gap usually increases over time with post-launch driver updates. Nevertheless, the 7800X3D, until now, was the best gaming CPU available, so these improvements are no real surprise — so, it's far more interesting to compare the 9800X3D against Intel's top-end CPU: the Core Ultra 9 285K. While writing my Intel Core Ultra 9 285K review, no graphical setting changes would significantly increase my FPS in Forza Horizon 5. While it's likely a bug, this chart accurately represents the best framerate I can achieve at this time with the 'High' preset at 1080p. Matching estimations, Black Myth: Wukong scores almost identically on AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D and Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K, while the "121.9%" gains promised in the CPU-centric title Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation didn't manifest in my testing, sticking around 6% instead. While not much of a surprise given its excellent performance on practically any hardware, Forza Horizon 5 scores an outrageous average of 387 FPS, which is perfect for anyone who uses those 360Hz 1080p gaming monitors. However, something clearly is bugged on Intel's side, so I'm skipping the implied percentage gain for Forza. Moving from a disastrous launch to a patched-up marvel, Cyberpunk 2077 sees a 52% performance increase on the 9800X3D over Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K, proving far better of a pairing to NVIDIA's current high-end GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card. Far Cry 6 bumps up performance by 43% with the same GPU and DDR5-6000 RAM pairing, and the latest blockbuster Call of Duty entry enjoys a 41% lead as the 9800X3D earns extra frames in Black Ops 6. So, while I'm testing a tighter scope of popular AAA titles on PC, I still saw around a 36% performance increase in gaming with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. Naturally, my number would be lower if I only tested games closer to the 100% to 110% range of AMD's generational game performance chart, but seeing visually-rich megahits like Call of Duty and Cyberpunk 2077 score such significant increases is reassuring for the performance of a brand-new processor at day one. Yes, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best gaming CPU you can buy, taking over from its predecessor, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D. 96MB of second-generation 3D V-Cache in the Zen 5 architecture helps push for higher FPS (frames per second) in games than Intel's top-end Core Ultra 9 285K, a rival processor that features more cores and threads, a higher clock speed, and slightly higher TDP. Ultimately, Intel's more expensive CPU offers better multi-core performance in productivity tasks and synthetic benchmarks, but AMD wins in gaming performance. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D has three significant competitors, though only two would be taken seriously by anyone on a budget. Internally, Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K stands against AMD's gaming CPU simply because it's the most powerful chip in the latest Core Ultra Series 200S range. However, this 24-core, 24-thread carries a price tag of around $589 to $630 and targets an entirely different audience who prioritizes energy efficiency within a productivity-centric software suite. Gaming performance on Intel's side remains relatively unchanged from its last-gen Core i9-14900K, which offered similar performance to its i9-13900K predecessor and suffered from an overarching microcode launch bug that was later fixed for the continued manufacturing of 14th Gen chips. Still, listings for the Core i9-14900K sit around $440 as AMD's Ryzen 9800X3D is ready to launch, making it an attractive option since some of its best motherboards support an established LGA 1700 socket with wide DDR4 and DDR5 RAM support, bringing down the overall cost of a custom build. The other major competitor is a call from inside Team Red's house, as the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D doesn't fall far enough behind the new 9800X3D to warrant an upgrade from anyone who already has one. On the other hand, those who already adopted the AM5 socket with all-new motherboards and DDR5 RAM could happily swap out their processor for this new replacement without buying any extra components, but dropping almost $500 on an 8-22% potential performance gain isn't so tempting. So, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D stands as a more logical upgrade path for those using a Ryzen 7 5800X3D from 2022. Still, this lumps users with the mandatory motherboard and RAM upgrades, though most AM4-compatible CPU coolers will work with AM5 replacements, so it's not entirely damaging to your budget. The bright side is that you'll feel a more significant boost if you upgrade from the 5800X3D, with compatibility for PCIe 5.0 (Gen 5), unlocking faster storage options with the CPU bump. Overall, it's a sticky situation because the only people who will see the most significant benefits are the ones doomed to spend extra cash on a total rig overhaul. ✅ You want the absolute best gaming CPU on the market. ✅ You crave the highest framerate count possible for high-FPS gameplay. ❌ You're already using a Ryzen 7 7800X3D or high-end 14th Gen Core i9. ❌ You rely on productivity apps that demand the best multi-core performance. Make no mistake: the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best gaming CPU, politely dethroning its predecessor as the new king of the hill as a cache-heavy monster. However, it's not winning any awards for productivity. It isn't worth installing into a PC that spends most of its time crunching numbers in Microsoft Office and Teams since the 9900X and 9950X dominate that category, but it's a far better pick for gamers than anything from Intel's modern productivity-centric offerings. Unfortunately, those who'll benefit most will need to spend a sizeable amount of cash on a new motherboard and RAM upgrades, making the 9800X3D MSRP hike sting a little more than a cute $30. Nevertheless, this is the new meta for PC gaming, and nothing else can challenge its ability to deliver monstrous FPS counts if you can pair it with a capable GPU to enjoy the latest AAA titles loaded with visual luxuries. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D is a hot pick for those willing to upgrade, taking over from the 7800X3D as the best gaming CPU and beating Intel's top offering.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) surged as much as 25% before paring gains in after-hours trading on Tuesday as investors brace for more wild swings with Donald Trump edging ahead of Kamala Harris in the latest election results. All states have now closed their respective polling stations. So far, Trump has secured 248 electoral college votes, while Harris has claimed 214, according to the Associated Press. The stock had a wild session during market hours on Tuesday as trading was halted several times due to volatility, with shares quickly erasing 15% gains and reversing Monday's double-digit percentage rise to kick off the week. Despite a recovery from steeper losses, shares still closed down a little over 1%. The latest price action comes as investors await the results of the presidential election between the Republican nominee and his challenger. Volatility in the stock is expected to continue as strategists categorize the stock as a binary bet on the election. Matthew Tuttle, CEO of investment fund Tuttle Capital Management, recently told Yahoo Finance's Catalysts that the trajectory of shares hinges on "a buy the rumor, sell the fact" trading strategy. Read more: Trump vs. Harris: 4 ways the next president could impact your bank accounts "I would imagine that the day after him winning, you'd see this come down," he surmised. "If he loses, I think it goes to zero." Interactive Brokers' chief strategist Steve Sosnick said DJT has taken on a meme-stock "life of its own." "It was volatile on the way up, and when a stock is that volatile in one direction, it has a tendency to be that volatile in the other direction," he said on a call with Yahoo Finance last week. In September, shares in the company — the home of the Republican nominee's social media platform, Truth Social — traded at its lowest level since the company's debut following the expiration of its highly publicized lockup period. Shares had bounced back from their lows, though, as both domestic and overseas betting markets shifted in favor of a Trump victory. Trump founded Truth Social after he was kicked off major social media apps like Facebook (META) and Twitter, now X, following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots. Trump has since been reinstated on those platforms. He officially returned to posting on X in mid-August after about a year's hiatus. As Truth Social attempts to take on social media incumbents, the fundamentals of the company have long been in question. On Tuesday, DJT dropped third quarter results after the market close that revealed a net loss of $19.25 million for the quarter ending Sept. 30. This was narrower than the $26.03 million the company reported in the year-ago period. DJT also reported revenue of $1.01 million, a slight year-over-year drop compared to the $1.07 million it reported in the third quarter of 2023. Over the past nine months ending Sept. 30, revenue has fallen 23% from the prior-year period. Last month, the company revealed that its COO had stepped down in September. Trump maintains a roughly 60% interest in DJT, making his share worth billions. Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Title: Should You Pick META Stock At $560?

AUSTIN, TEXAS - SEPTEMBER 18: In this photo illustration, the Instagram logo is displayed on a ... [+] computer screen on September 18, 2024 in Austin, Texas. (Photo illustration by Brandon Bell/Getty Images) Meta stock (NASDAQ: META) has seen a 3% fall in a week, while it’s up around 60% this year. The company recently reported its Q3 results, which were better than the street estimates. Its top line stood at $40.6 billion and the bottom line at $6.03, compared to the consensus estimates of $40.2 billion and $5.25, respectively. Despite a beat, the stock didn’t see any gains, as investors were concerned about higher costs. Let’s dive deeper into the company’s quarterly performance and its impact on META stock. Also, look at what’s happening with Google stock. Meta Platforms’ revenues of $40.6 billion in Q3 reflected a 19% y-o-y rise, driven by a 7% rise in ad impressions and an 11% growth in average price per ad. Meta also reported a 5% rise in family daily active people to 3.29 billion. Most of the company’s revenue came from ad sales on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. The company is benefiting from its AI push, targeting more advertising. The company plans to use AI to generate more content. Not only did the company post higher revenues, its operating margin expanded to 43%, up around 300 bps y-o-y. Higher revenues and margin expansion resulted in earnings of $6.03 per share, up 37% y-o-y. Looking forward, Meta expects its Q4 revenue to be in the range of $45 billion to $48 billion. What didn’t sit well with the investors was the company’s hike in capital spending guidance to $38 billion to $40 billion and higher investments in 2025 as well. This compares with $27 billion Meta spent in capital expenditures in 2023. Much of the new investments are related to the company’s AI push involving data centers and related infrastructure. META stock, with 60% gains this year, has outperformed some of the other large tech stocks, including GOOG, up 21%, AMZN, up 28%, and MSFT, up 9%. However, we think META stock is appropriately priced now. We estimate Meta Platforms’ valuation to be $560 per share, aligning with its current levels. At $560, META stock is already trading at 25x expected earnings of $22.65 in 2024, compared to the stock’s average P/E ratio of 17x over the last three years. A rise in valuation multiple for META makes sense given the solid advertising growth lately. However, continued aggressive investments into AI also poses a slight risk if it would eventually provide a meaningful boost to the company’s earnings growth. For now, the story for most of the tech stocks is about valuation multiples. Some of them are trading at levels higher than seen over recent years. Although META stock has seen a 2x rise since 2021, the increase has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 23% in 2021, -64% in 2022, and 194% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. While META stock looks appropriately priced, it is helpful to see how Meta’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: Vornado Reports Strong Office Leasing as NYU Master Leases 770 Broadway

© 2024 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Steven Roth’s Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) reported lower cash flow in the third quarter of 2024 than it generated in the previous year’s third quarter, but the real estate investment trust emphasized its improving office leasing numbers — with New York University agreeing to master lease 1.1 million square feet at 770 Broadway — with high rents as it winds down the year. During Tuesday’s third quarter earnings call, Vornado reported funds from operations reached $99.25 million in the third quarter of 2024, down from $119.48 in the previous year’s third quarter. Moreover, funds from operations for the first nine months of the year hit $352.9 million, down from $382.5 million compared to the first nine months of 2023. The firm’s dividend to shareholders in the third quarter ended at 52 cents per diluted share, less than 66 cents per diluted share in the third quarter of 2023. Roth struck a confident and defiant tone when reporting the firm’s financials, and said that Vornado expects to pay a dividend of 68 cents per share to shareholders at the end of the year in order to conserve cash. In 2023, Vornado suspended dividend payments beginning in April of that year. “While our business is financially better and improving, we’ll continue to be rigorous with cash management,” he said. “This strategy has been understood and is endorsed by our major shareholders. I expect as conditions normalize, so will our dividend.” Vornado president and chief financial officer Michael J. Franco said that the quarter’s financial results were expected to be down from the previous year due to “items previously forecasted,” notably recent vacancies at several Manhattan office properties. “This decrease was primarily attributable to lower [net-operating income] from known move-outs, largely at 770 Broadway, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, 280 Park Avenue, and higher net interest expenses, both of which we have previously discussed,” said Franco. Those move-outs included Facebook parent company meta dropping 275,000 square feet at 770 Broadway when its lease expires this year. However, Vornado got a break as it announced Tuesday that NYU agreed to master-lease the entire 1.1 million-square-foot office portion of the Broadway building. But both Roth and Franco pointed to encouraging leasing and occupancy numbers to make the case that the REIT’s office-heavy business model has finally turned the corner after several years of post-COVID uncertainty. Roth reported that year-to-date leasing reached 2.5 million square-feet company-wide, including 2.1 million square feet in Manhattan. He said that he’s confident the firm will reach between 3.5 million and 3.8 million square feet of leases in Manhattan by the end of the year, which would be the second-highest annual amount in the firm’s history, with “the highest starting rents ever.” “Activity is robust,” said Roth. “No new supply always begets a landlord’s market. Our rents are going up, I’m extremely optimistic, and the stock market seems to agree.” Vornado’s stock price opened at $42.81 on Tuesday, up from the $22.88 it sat at on Nov. 6, 2023. Aside from the NYU deal, Roth and Franco highlighted several other large leasing transactions in the firm’s Manhattan portfolio. Vornado leased 740,000 square feet of office space in the third quarter, including 297,000 square feet that Google renewed at 85 10th Avenue and leasing totals of 70,000 square feet of space at Penn 1, with an average starting rent of $119 per square foot. The NYU deal at 770 Broadway includes an upfront payment of prepaid rent that will allow Vornado to pay off its $700 million loan on the property, according to Roth. All told, the firm leased 2 million square feet in New York City across 68 transactions in the first nine months of 2024, with average starting rent of $112 per square foot, according to Franco. “The tide has clearly shifted in the New York, Class-A office market: leasing activity is strong and gaining momentum and availability are declining, particularly for large blocks of space,” said Franco. Vornado reported office occupancy of 87.5 percent in the third quarter, down from 89.3 percent in the previous quarter. Franco blamed the expiration of Meta’s lease at 770 Broadway for the small decline, but stated that the NYU master lease at the same office building will bring the firm’s office occupancy up to 90.8 percent by January. He also said vacant space at the newly opened Penn 2 has impacted occupancy levels, but that will also only be temporary. “The easiest money we can make is filling up our empties. As occupancy rises, earnings will go up,” he said. “Our office occupancy will likely decrease in the first quarter 2025, and as vacant space at Penn 2 is placed into service, we anticipate that this decrease will be temporary, and as Penn 2 stabilizes we get to 93 [percent occupancy].” Vornado also announced its portfolio’s retail occupancy rates stand at 78 percent, but Roth argued that excluding Manhattan mall vacancies brings the firm’s retail occupancy closer to 90 percent. “So, actually, we’re pretty well leased in above-the-market occupancies,” he said. “There is strong demand in retail and retail is certainly in much better shape than it was a couple of years ago.” The firm said it carries liquidity of $2.6 billion, with $1 billion cash on its balance sheet. “We are in a very strong capital position,” said Roth. “Our single focus is in creating value, being financially disciplined, and getting our stock price up to where we think the value is and where it should be. “In order to do that, we need to keep leasing, keep improving our balance sheet, and cutting out assets we don’t want, turning them into cash, and continue to work on the very significant and great asset pool we currently have,” he added. “But, actually, I’m all about the stock price.” Brian Pascus can be reached at bpascus@commercialobserver.com.

Title: What's Happening With Google Stock?

[+] Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Alphabet stock (NASDAQ: GOOG) saw a marginal growth of over 1% last week, despite it reporting a solid quarter. The company reported revenue of $88.3 billion and earnings of $2.12 per share, both metrics well above the consensus estimates of $86.3 billion and $1.85, respectively. The increased demand for AI solutions drove the growth for the company. However, much of the positives appears to be priced in for its stock. In this note, we discuss the key takeaways from Alphabet’s results, its stock performance, and valuation. Also, check out should you Buy, Sell, Or Hold Amazon? Google’s revenues of $88.3 billion in Q3 reflected a 15% y-o-y gain. The growth was led by its cloud business, with segment sales up a solid 35% to $11.4 billion. Google search revenue was up 12% to $49.4 billion, and YouTube ad revenue was also up 12% to $8.9 billion y-o-y. The company’s self-driving car unit — Waymo — is now seeing 150,000 weekly paid rides. Waymo could be the next big thing for Google. See how Waymo could be worth $5 trillion. Not only did Alphabet see its revenue rise, its operating margin expanded 450 bps y-o-y to 32.3% in Q3. Higher revenue and margin expansion led to a 37% rise in the bottom line to $2.12 per share. Looking forward, we expect the company to post revenue of $96 billion in Q4, and earnings to be around $2.15 per share. While Alphabet’s results were solid, its stock price appears to have little room for growth, in our view. We estimate Google’s valuation to be $182 per share, reflecting only 6% upside from its current levels of over $170. Our forecast is based on 23x expected earnings of $8.05 per share in 2024. The 23x figure is higher than the stock average P/E ratio of 18x seen over the last three years. GOOG stock is trading at a multiple lower than some of its peers, with META trading at 26x and AMZN at 40x forward expected earnings. That is because there remains a key risk for Alphabet. Google is facing antitrust cases, alleging the company to monopolize the marketplace and the general search services. The remedies could include a breakup of the company, which seems unlikely for now, regulatory oversight, and restrictions on businesses, among others. None of these would bode well for Alphabet’s businesses in the long term. As such, despite a strong growth visibility in the cloud business, on the back of AI demand, and continued ad revenue gains, we think that the stock may not see any meaningful growth in the near term. GOOG stock has seen over 20% gains this year, broadly aligning with the returns for the S&P500 index. However, the change in GOOG stock over the recent years has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for GOOG stock were 65% in 2021, -39% in 2022, and 59% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. While GOOG stock looks like it has little room for growth, it is helpful to see how Google’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: Will Wall Street allow Big Tech to make AI work?

Artificial intelligence (AI) is taking over – at least when it comes to the stock market and investors. In the past few months, we have seen the value of chip companies that have positioned themselves in the AI sector soar. Nvidia has overtaken Intel, a situation that might once have been unthinkable. Newcomers such as OpenAI and Anthropic have been making inroads into the market, attracting significant valuations from investors. And it seems that anyone who is anyone is getting involved in AI in some way. If there was any doubt that AI was attracting big money, a look at the most recent round of quarterly results should have put that to bed. Last week, several of the largest tech companies – Meta, Google, Microsoft, AWS – revealed increased spending on the technology as they each try to capitalise on the interest in AI. But there is more to come. Big tech companies are planning to spend even more in building their AI arsenal into next year, and hoping to persuade customers to adopt it at scale. The question is, will Wall Street give them the space to do it? Lest we forget, it is not too long ago that the same companies that are investing heavily in their AI capabilities were telling their staff that they needed to cut their cloth to fit the new economic reality, at the mercy of fluctuating share price. That new economic reality seems to include the shiny new AI toys, for which tech companies seem prepared to offer deep budgets. If the promise of AI is realised, then the billions ploughed into developing the technology will be seen as a sensible investment. But if not, it won’t be the first time that a much-hyped new technology fails to live up to the forecasts. Fully autonomous cars, which have been in development for years, have yet to reach any sort of meaningful market. NFTs promising a new wave of artists revenue, selling for outrageous sums, have fallen out of favour. And lets not forget the world of crypto. For now, Wall Street is watching, nervously. If there is a hint of the technology not reaching its potential, the money that has flowed in to AI companies could just as quickly flow out.
