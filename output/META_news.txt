Title: The Only 3 Ways to Actually Make Money in B2B AI (And Why “AI-Enhanced” Doesn’t Count Anymore)

by Jason Lemkin | Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blog Posts, SaaStr.Ai Most B2B companies claiming to be “AI-powered” aren’t seeing growth accelerate. Not because their technology doesn’t work, but because they’re playing the wrong game entirely. Path 1: Attach to Compute Infrastructure Path 2: Replace Human Headcount Path 3: Massively Displace an Incumbent Everything else is noise in AI and B2B. Let’s break down why each works, how to know if you’re actually doing it, and where most companies go wrong. DataDog’s 23% stock surge after earnings wasn’t luck. It was the inevitable result of a simple principle: sell to the people building AI, and as they grow, you grow automatically. “The AI leaders, the hyperscalers — they’re starting to buy like classic B2B companies,” Jason explains. “They’re recycling the same people in procurement. So if you’re attached to AI budget and you’re a DataDog era, you’re actually going to have a great 2026.” Rory adds critical context: “DataDog is a core piece of compute infrastructure and these hyperscalers are the most compute-intensive companies that have ever been known. If you’re selling compute stuff, you should be having a great quarter. If you’re selling routers, switches, interconnects, whatever it takes to stand up Stargate — you’re going to be golden.” The hyperscalers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, Meta) are deploying unprecedented amounts of compute. They’re not just buying different things — they’re buying MORE of everything: Here’s the key insight: These companies buy like traditional B2B enterprises, just at 10x the scale and 10x the speed. OpenAI isn’t some mystical different creature when it comes to procurement. They need observability. They need security. They need data tools. They need all the same infrastructure any rapidly-scaling company needs — they just need more of it because they’re deploying more compute than any companies in history. Ask yourself these questions: If you can’t answer yes to at least 2-3 of these, you’re not actually playing the compute infrastructure game. Jason’s prediction: “If you have attached to AI budget and you’re a DataDog era, you’re actually going to have a great 2026.” Why? Because the infrastructure layer is just getting started. The capex spend on AI is still accelerating. Data center buildouts are still in early innings. The hyperscalers are still ramping their compute deployments. Every single piece of software that sits in that stack — from chip to model to deployment — is going to see explosive growth. But you need to actually be IN that stack, not adjacent to it. Here’s where companies get confused. They think, “We help AI companies be more productive, so we’re attached to AI.” No. That’s not the same thing. Compute-attached means your revenue scales automatically with compute deployment. It means you’re essential infrastructure, not a productivity enhancer. It means when Stargate comes online with $100B of compute, your revenue goes up whether you do anything or not. If you’re a project management tool that AI companies use, you’re not compute-attached. You’re just selling to hot companies. That’s fine, but don’t confuse it with the DataDog playbook. “Where are you replacing humans for real?” Jason asks. “Where are you going to go in and reduce the headcount that vendor needs by half?” This is the path most companies claim to be on but aren’t actually delivering. The difference between real human replacement and “AI-enhanced productivity” is stark. Jason runs through his experience deploying 20+ AI agents at SaaStr: “We have Reply for Replit (we call it ‘Reply’). We have RD for Artisan which is an SDR. We have Quali for Qualified. They all have these little desks where there’s no human at it anymore.” But here’s the critical distinction he makes about Replit’s V3 agent: “It is the first one that jumped the line to not being one of the parts of our team, but literally being part of our team just like a human being.” What makes it different? It’s sufficiently autonomous, knowledgeable and powerful to complete material high-value tasks on its own with some daily discussions just like on our team. Not “it helps us be more efficient.” Not “it automates some tasks.” It completes high-value work autonomously with the same level of oversight you’d give a human team member. Jason makes a crucial point: “Most of the time, ‘replacing humans’ is a story.” Here’s how to know if you’re actually replacing humans versus just telling yourself you are: Real Human Replacement: Fake Human Replacement (productivity story): Jason walks through how Gamma could evolve from Path 3 (displacement) to Path 2 (replacement): “When Gamma can do this — go into my Google Calendar, create prospectuses and sales collateral for all 20 sales calls this week, pull all the data on them last year from Salesforce and HubSpot and Marketo, put them all apart, review them once, and then distribute them to the team — Gamma’s part of our team.” That’s not “AI-enhanced PowerPoint creation.” That’s replacing a marketing operations person entirely. “It’s not that far away,” Jason notes. “Not just make me PowerPoint. When Gamma is part of your marketing team rather than a marketing tool, there’s a lot of revenue expansion if they can pull it off.” Jason identifies the key shift happening right now: “The co-pilot was the 2024 story. It didn’t work. It was a ripoff. Spend $30 more a month on Office like no one wanted the ripoff. This year OpenAI and Claude finally actually got good. That’s why Lovable, Replit, Gamma exploded. Next year is AI is part of your team.” 2024: Co-pilots (didn’t work) Tools that made you more efficient but required constant human oversight and direction. 2025: Agents that work (breakthrough year) Applications where AI finally got good enough to deliver real value autonomously. 2026: AI team members (what’s coming) AI that’s sufficiently autonomous to be actual members of your team, not just tools your team uses. That transition from tool to team member is where the revenue explosion happens. Because when AI is a team member, companies will pay team-member prices ($50K-$150K+ per year), not tool prices ($10-$100 per month). If you’re building a company to replace human headcount: Jason’s right that most companies avoid saying this explicitly, but the economics are undeniable: “If you are not removing humans from the equation, you are going to be heavily discounted.” The market is dividing into: You have to choose which game you’re playing. And if you choose Path 2, you need to actually deliver on human replacement, not just talk about it. “You have a third option,” Jason concedes. “Use AI to massively displace an incumbent and steal all the revenue. In fact, that’s the history of B2B software mostly.” This is the path that sounds most familiar to traditional B2B investors. It’s what Salesforce did to Siebel. What HubSpot did to Marketo (before Marketo became HubSpot). What Slack did to email for internal communication. But Jason is deeply skeptical this path works well in the AI era: “I just don’t know how many of our public leaders are in a place to steal their own revenue.” In the traditional SaaS era, you had ~3 years before incumbents would really compete: “You’d be like, well, Salesforce or HubSpot, whoever, it’ll take them like a year and a half to decide if it’s worth cloning. Then they’ll launch something and it’ll be okay because they have smart engineers, but it won’t actually do anything. The first six months it’ll be so feature poor. Then after two years they’ll decide, should I put 100 people on this?” That timeline has collapsed from 3 years to 30 days. Jason shares a brutal example: “I can think of one investment I’ve made that has had five clones in the first 30 days, including one from a cloud leader.” The AI-enabled cloning speed changes everything. Canva is now “borderline competitive” with Gamma — and Canva wasn’t even a competitor when Gamma’s CEO was on the show just months earlier. Jason’s skepticism crystallizes around the most obvious displacement opportunity: CRM. “There’s like 400 AI CRM startups out there all saying they’re going to eat HubSpot’s and Salesforce’s lunch. That’s not exciting to me as an investment. That’s much less exciting than truly replacing 90% of your GTM team.” Why isn’t this exciting? Jason isn’t saying Path 3 is impossible. He’s saying it’s the hardest path and requires specific conditions: You need at least 3 of these 4: The Duolingo discussion illuminates why incumbent displacement is so hard for public companies. Duolingo displaced Berlitz and traditional language schools. Hooray. But now what? Jason: “Where are you going to disrupt humans? This is your job. You already disrupted those humans. Unfortunately, they’re gone. Where’s the next level of human disruption?” Rory sees the opportunity: “The next generation of companies that are going to be teaching a foreign language will be LLM-based. We’ve seen companies doing more professional, more interactive teaching using LLMs. There’s a whole ton to be done in terms of one-on-one instruction.” But here’s the problem: Duolingo can’t easily displace itself. They have a business model built around light learning at consumer prices ($10-20/month). The AI opportunity is intensive learning at tutoring prices ($50-200/month). That requires cannibalizing their existing revenue model. This is why Path 3 is especially hard for incumbents. They’re not in a position to displace themselves. Which creates the opening for startups, but also means you’re starting from zero on distribution against companies with millions of users. Jason’s answer: Only if you can’t play Path 1 or Path 2. “We can fund those deals as investors, but I think the first two categories are much easier — attached to the compute or replace humans — rather than just steal.” The math is simple: All three can work. But Path 3 requires the most capital, the longest timeline, and has the highest failure rate. Jason drops a truth bomb midway through the discussion: “We’re in the Captain Obvious era of investing. You either got something or you ain’t getting funded anyway.” What does this mean for these three paths? If you’re on Path 1 (compute-attached): Your growth should be automatic. If the hyperscalers are deploying 3x more compute and your revenue isn’t growing 2-3x, something is broken. This should be the most “Captain Obvious” path of all. If you’re on Path 2 (replacing humans): Your customers should be measurably reducing headcount or headcount growth. If they’re not, you’re not actually replacing humans — you’re just a productivity tool. If you’re on Path 3 (displacing incumbents): You should be winning deals against the incumbent consistently, not just in small accounts. If you’re only winning when there’s no incumbent, you’re not displacing anyone. The test is simple: Is your success obvious? Or are you explaining why your metrics are actually good despite not looking impressive? Throughout the discussion, the panel keeps coming back to what doesn’t work: using AI to make your existing product better. Jason is blunt: “Using AI to make your product better? That’s table stakes now, not a competitive advantage.” This is the Duolingo problem. They’re using AI to improve their language learning. Great. Every single competitor can do that too. There’s no moat in “we use AI to make our product better.” Rory agrees: “Every single portfolio company at scale should be using AI by this point to make your product better. This is not 2023. You don’t get any kudos for sprinkling AI dust on your product.” In 2023: Adding AI features was novel and impressive. Companies could raise on “we’re adding AI to X.” In 2025: Adding AI features is expected. It’s like saying “we have a mobile app” in 2023. Cool, so does everyone else. The market has moved from “are you using AI?” to “how are you using AI to capture revenue in one of the three ways that actually work?” Let’s be explicit about what isn’t one of the three paths: Not Path 1: “We sell to AI companies” Unless you’re infrastructure they can’t build AI without, this is just selling to hot companies. When the AI boom ends or slows, your growth ends. Not Path 2: “We make teams more efficient with AI” Unless headcount actually goes down or dramatically slows its growth, you’re not replacing humans. You’re selling productivity software. That’s fine, but it’s not Path 2. Not Path 3: “We’re better than the incumbent because we have AI” Unless you’re 10x better and winning head-to-head deals consistently, you’re not displacing anyone. You’re just another alternative. Harry shares a data point that shows how much the market has shifted: A classic enterprise SaaS company grew from $400K to $3M ARR (10x growth). Five years ago, this would have generated five term sheets from top firms. Today: 120 meetings, one term sheet at 12x revenue. Why? Because it’s not playing any of the three games. It’s not compute-attached. It’s not replacing humans. And it’s not dramatically displacing an incumbent with AI. It’s just a good SaaS company growing well. That’s not good enough anymore. Jason: “It’s the most binary fundraising environment in our lifetimes. You’re either Captain Obvious getting funded, or you’re not seeing it anywhere.” If you’re building a company or investing in one, here’s how to think about which path to pursue: Best for: Infrastructure engineers who understand ML workflows, companies with existing relationships in cloud/DevOps Best for: Founders who have done the job they’re replacing, deep understanding of workflow completion, strong AI/agent expertise Best for: Domain experts in industries with weak incumbents, founders with deep incumbent knowledge, situations with massive technological discontinuity If you can do Path 1, do Path 1. It’s the easiest and most capital-efficient. If you can’t do Path 1, do Path 2. The market for replacing humans is massive and underpenetrated. Only do Path 3 if you can’t do the first two or if you have specific advantages (domain expertise, weak incumbent, vertical specialization) that make it compelling. Jason’s final point ties it all together: “If you’re in software today and this isn’t the most exciting time of your lifetime, you’re doing it wrong. This is the first time software has gotten better since the three of us met.” But that excitement only matters if you’re playing one of the three games that actually capture revenue: Everything else — all the “AI-enhanced” products, all the “using AI to be better” positioning, all the sprinkling of AI dust on existing products — that’s not going to generate venture-scale returns. The market is telling us this clearly. DataDog up 23%. Duolingo down 25%. Same week. Both “using AI.” One playing a winning game, one not. Choose your path wisely. Because in 2025/2026, there are only three that actually work. Founder SaaStr Email Address Company Job Title Email Address Get from $0 to $100 Million in ARRwith less stress and more success.

Make sure to set Windows Central as a preferred source in Google Search, and find out why you should so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more. Following the launch of Gemini 3 with advanced capabilities across video, reasoning, and coding, Google is now the talk of the town in the generative AI category. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently admitted that the Gemini team had done a great job with the launch. Even NVIDIA, which has also been flying high due to the high demand for chips to foster AI advances (unlocking $4 trillion in market capitalization), recently indicated that it is delighted by Google's success (via Tom's Hardware). But perhaps more interestingly, the chipmaker used the opportunity to toot its own horn: "Nvidia is a generation ahead of the industry — it's the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done. Nvidia offers greater performance, versatility, and fungibility than ASICs, which are designed for specific AI frameworks or functions." This news comes after reports claim that Meta is currently in discussions with Google to rent its Cloud Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) in 2026, and even potentially buy them in the subsequent year. Consequently, Alphabet (Google's parent company) and Meta's stock prices saw a significant increase. However, NVIDIA's stock price dropped by 3%. We’re delighted by Google’s success — they’ve made great advances in AI and we continue to supply to Google.NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry — it’s the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done.NVIDIA offers greater…November 25, 2025 Google's Cloud TPUs are quite different from NVIDIA's AI GPUs. For context, the former's offerings are designed to help with AI model training and inference, while the latter are designed for parallel processing, allowing them to handle billions of calculations simultaneously. While speaking to CNBC, a Google spokesman indicated: “We are experiencing accelerating demand for both our custom TPUs and Nvidia GPUs. We are committed to supporting both, as we have for years.” During NVIDIA's earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang addressed the rising TPU competition, indicating that Google is the company's customer for GPU chips and that Gemini can run on its technology.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nvidia's sterling armor was dented this month. After years of meteoric success, the chipmaker and its CEO Jensen Huang have increasingly found themselves playing defense — an unusual position for the company. Nvidia headed into the month with its stock price at an all-time high, bolstered by increasing AI spending from some of its major Big Tech customers like Meta, Microsoft, and Google. Huang was hot off of Nvidia's GTC conference in Washington, where he dismissed any concerns of an AI bubble and sounded jubilant. But over the course of the month, which saw Nvidia shed 11% of its value, the chipmaker has gone from smashing earnings and alleviating Wall Street's AI bubble fears to becoming the poster boy of what some analysts view as a company on an unsustainable path. Nvidia has also had to fend off short-sellers and the growing threat of Google, picking up some bruises along the way. Big names, including SoftBank and Peter Thiel, cashed out on the Wall Street darling that had became the world's first $4 trillion market cap company mere months ago. SoftBank announced it fully exited its Nvidia position, selling $5.8 billion in shares to bet on OpenAI. And while its CFO stressed it had "nothing to do with Nvidia itself," the move didn't exactly dispel the ongoing AI bubble talk. Nvidia defiantly pushed back on any investor skittishness when it released its third-quarter earnings on November 19, surpassing analysts' already lofty expectations — no small feat — at a time when concerns about the AI bubble were once again creeping up. "There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble," Huang told analysts on a call following the results. "From our vantage point, we see something very different." But while shares rallied in after-hours trading following the results, markets did a U-turn the following day as hand-wringing over ballooning tech valuations and spending continued. Behind closed doors, Huang privately told employees in remarks first reported by Business Insider that "the market did not appreciate" Nvidia's "incredible" quarter. Facing sky-high expectations and the position of being a bellwether for the AI industry, Huang described the chipmaker as being in a somewhat no-win situation. "If we delivered a bad quarter, it is evidence there's an AI bubble. If we delivered a great quarter, we are fueling the AI bubble," Huang said during an all-hands meeting. It didn't take long for things to get a bit choppy for the chipmaker. Shares of Nvidia fell after The Information reported that Google was engaged in talks with Meta to provide the social network billions worth of the tech giant's own advanced chips. While Nvidia's chips have long been the gold standard in the AI race, a hot commodity used by tech giants and startups to train and run LLMs and chatbots, the news suggested that the chipmaker's market share might be under threat. With Google now eyeing Nvidia's lunch, the market digested a possible future where Nvidia may no longer be the star attraction. Nvidia's market losses following the news appeared to be Google's gain, with its parent company Alphabet now positioned to join the $4 trillion club that Nvidia started. And in a move that raised some eyebrows, Nvidia released a mostly defiant statement that praised Google's success but said Nvidia's chips are "a generation ahead of the industry." The developments acted as fuel for Michael Burry of "The Big Short" fame, who has become increasingly vocal about voicing his doubts about Nvidia. Burry, who has a particularly dour view of the AI industry, spent much of the month questioning the longevity of Nvidia's chips, its stock dilution, and its circular, "give-and-take deals" in AI. The investor recently leaned into online writing and labeled Nvidia as the Cisco of the AI bubble era in one of his first Substack posts. "And once again there is a Cisco at the center of it all, with the picks and shovels for all and the expansive vision to go with it," Burry wrote. "Its name is Nvidia." The chipmaker didn't take the criticism lying down. In a note to Wall Street sell-side analysts, a copy of which was obtained by Business Insider, Nvidia took exception to Burry's claims, stating that he appeared to have "incorrectly" made some of his calculations. The memo also pushed back against views that Nvidia is too entangled in circular financial arrangements with some of its customers. "First, Nvidia's strategic investments represent a small share of Nvidia's revenue and an even smaller share of approximately $1T raised each year across global private capital markets," the memo said, adding, "The companies in Nvidia's strategic investment portfolio predominantly generate revenue from third-party customers, not from Nvidia." Burry called Nvidia's response "disappointing" and disclosed that he "continues to own puts" on Nvidia. While November undoubtedly turned up the heat on Nvidia, the chipmaker continues to be the world's most valuable company by market cap and its shares have slightly rebounded in recent days, closing up 1.37% on Wednesday. The world's largest tech companies rely on Nvidia's chips and have committed to spend billions and billions on the latest generation. CEO Jensen Huang has said sales of its latest Blackwell chips have been "off the charts." Nvidia's CFO, Colette Kress, told analysts earlier this month that the company is on track to bring in "half a trillion" in AI chip orders during the combined 2025-2026 period — a number that she said "will grow" as more deals are struck. While Nvidia's bruising back half of the month is a reminder that even AI royalty can see its crown threatened, Huang had some words for the doubters during the company's earnings call. "As a reminder, Nvidia is unlike any other accelerator," he said. "We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference." Jump to

Title: The new plan for Urban Planning Authorities, the Eurogroup on K.M.’s agenda with Weber, CVC sells marinas in a €1.5 billion deal, the Church and the auction

Hello, I find political news today less interesting than two other issues that are much more serious. The first concerns that tragic accident last Friday in Pagrati, in which an 84-year-old driver hit and killed a 75-year-old woman who was walking with her 30-year-old daughter with disabilities. When, finally, in this country will elderly people undergo serious tests in order to renew — or NOT renew — their driver’s license? It is time to put an end to an issue that literally kills innocent people. The second concerns the sudden work stoppage by STASY, due to a tragic accident that occurred in one of the company’s engine sheds in Piraeus. The work stoppage on the metro and tram paralyzed all of Athens yesterday afternoon and caused hardship to hundreds of thousands of citizens. The incident is tragic, but there is a prosecutor and an investigating judge looking into it and, if there is responsibility, it will be assigned through the Justice system. What is gained, and by whom, from making all of Athens suffer? Will working conditions change because of yesterday’s strike? Since the Thessaloniki International Fair, Stavros Papastavrou and Dimitris Papastergiou sat down to design how the reform announced by K.M. at the Fair will be implemented — specifically, the transfer of Urban Planning Offices from municipalities to the Cadastre. The plan has been prepared, will be presented today to the Cabinet, will begin to be implemented on a pilot basis in 2026, and fully by 2027. What it practically provides: integration of the Urban Planning Offices into the Cadastre Offices, both in substance and in the information system, and of course a reduction in physical contact points, through the digitalization of procedures. My understanding is that there will be one local Cadastre office per regional capital and one central office per region. Also, with the digital pool of cases, when one Urban Planning Office has a heavy workload, another with less can handle the work, without requiring contact with the engineer, the citizen, etc. Today at 20:00 K.M. has a scheduled dinner with the president of the EPP, Manfred Weber, who is in Athens with the candidate prime minister of the state of Baden-Württemberg, Manuel Hagel. Under other circumstances the dinner would be social in nature, but here it is obvious that K.M. wants to lobby on the issue of the Eurogroup and the prospect of the EPP supporting Pierre’s candidacy, who has just returned from Berlin. With K.M. at the central Athens restaurant will be Chatzidakis, who is also vice-president of the EPP, and ND’s Secretary for International Relations, Tasos Chatzivasileiou, who gets along well with the Germans. I asked my source who was describing the plan whether the matter of the Urban Planning Offices will stir up local reactions, as happened with the Hellenic Post. “Look, there are municipalities that react, but we do not want to put the mayors in opposition. There are also municipalities that don’t want to have anything to do with Urban Planning Offices,” he told me. As for the staff of the Urban Planning Offices, those who wish will be given the right to remain in the new structure, but if they do not want to, they will be absorbed into other services. I understand that perhaps even before year-end there may be an agreement between the government and industrialists on the issue of electricity and the subsidy that SEV is insistently demanding. After the issue of collective agreements, President Spyros Theodoropoulos has set course for an agreement and is in open communication with both K.M. and Chatzidakis. If I can make an estimate, the agreement will probably be somewhat less than what the industrialists wanted, but still—better than nothing… At the end of the week ND’s leadership will sit down to draft the plan for the party’s pre-congresses, which will pave the way for the party congress after Easter. There is information circulating that the start may be in Patras in the first ten days of December, but there is also the view that there is no point in doing anything before the holidays, as the party mechanism has already been mobilized one way or another due to internal elections. Therefore, the start may come in January, while the cities that will host the at least four pre-congresses will also be finalized. And we move on to market news with an interesting story about a fresh deal in the making. According to information, CVC is launching a process to sell D-Marin, the company that owns and manages marinas. It is a major deal, as the price is estimated to reach €1.5 billion. The Greek interest lies in the fact that included in the “package” coming to market are the marinas of Zea, Pylos, Lefkada, and the large marina in Gouvia, Corfu. According to the same sources, the sale process is taking place abroad. D-Marin owns 26 marinas in nine countries — Greece, Malta, Turkey, Croatia, Italy, France, Spain, Montenegro, and Albania. They sweated, but they are approaching the finish line. This concerns Masoutis and the acquisition of Kritikos, which barring surprises will be finalized by year-end. Initial estimates pointed to October, but it turned out not to be a walk in the park. The deal creates the third-largest player in the supermarket market in terms of turnover. Competitors argue that it will take time until the new entity is well organized and operates smoothly. Many shares of British gambling companies “went into the bucket” as the Labour government — making a dramatic effort to increase state revenue — decided to raise taxes on online gambling. The Remote Gaming Duty (RGD), imposed on online gambling, will rise to 40% in April 2026 from today’s 21%.Finance Minister Rachel Reeves aims to add over £1 billion annually to the state budget as a result of the new levies. However, the tax increase leads to a significant rise in costs for gambling companies, especially those offering online casino, betting, etc., with consequences for their suppliers and the entire sector’s chain. This may reduce profit margins, especially for smaller companies; some may be forced to downsize or restructure their activities through mergers or even leaving the market. Analysts believe there will be a drop in investment in the sector, as the increased tax burden makes the market less attractive.In this climate, the most affected shares were those of companies with high exposure to the British market. A characteristic example is Evoke (888, William Hill, etc.), which dropped 14%, while Entain (Ladbrokes, Coral, etc.) managed to absorb the pressure, and Flutter (Paddy Power, Betfair, FanDuel, etc.) closed in positive territory as it has significant presence in the U.S. Intralot, now controlled by Bally’s Interactive, was hit hard on the Athens Stock Exchange (-17%, at €0.92) due to its significant dependence on the UK market, since 60% of the new entity’s activities take place in the UK, where, among other things, it operates the highly popular online brand Monopoly Casino. Analysts consider the price of €80 million that OPAP will pay for the State Lotteries to be fair, if not advantageous. The company won the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP) tender for the 12-year concession of the exclusive management rights of the State Lotteries. It will pay a lump sum of €80 million, as well as 30% of gross profit annually, with a minimum guaranteed annual payment of €20 million. In April 2026, the current contract for the Lotteries held by Hellenic Lotteries expires, so OPAP managed to keep them in its portfolio until 2038. It is also noteworthy that OPAP will now have 100% of Hellenic Lotteries S.A., the company that has been running the State Lotteries to date, since Scientific Games is selling its 16.5% stake. Yesterday we also had the management’s conference call for the nine-month results, but no news emerged, and analysts and the market now await updates on the Allwyn–OPAP merger at the upcoming Capital Markets Update. The legal saga of Folli Follie continues, and at the latest hearing (November 25), objections were filed by the defendants — D. Koutsolioutsos, Aik. Koutsolioutsou and I. Begeitis — against the participation of shareholders supporting the accusation for fraud and forgery. Similar objections were filed against the participation of HCAP and EFKA. All objections will be decided at the next hearing. Regarding the FF request, the court announced it will give the floor only after its decision on the guilt or innocence of the defendants — that is, at the end of the trial. Despite the fact that this procedural order is provided by law and was followed at first instance, in practice, for cases such as this, it amounts to a form of “penalty” against the damaged party, who ends up being heard last, when everything has already been decided. The trial was again adjourned, to December 18, 2025. It is worth noting that the hearing at the Court of Appeal was originally set to begin on April 9, 2025, but since then it has been constantly postponed — from adjournment to suspension and back again. Time passes, the case drags on, and the administration of justice is tested by its own delays. Early this morning, at the five-star September City Resort Spa & Conference operated by Hotel Brain, in Pylaia, Thessaloniki, the entry of Telis Mystakidis into PAOK BC (KAE PAOK) is officially announced. The entrance into the new era begins with an “injection” of 5.5 million euros from the new major shareholder, while immediately afterwards a large share-capital increase will follow. To make all this happen, an extraordinary General Assembly of PAOK BC shareholders has already been convened for December 17, as required by the institutional framework, with the main item being the election of a new Board of Directors. This process constitutes the final formal step for the full and clean transition to the new ownership structure. It is well-known that the Church of Greece owns large real-estate holdings throughout the country. Now, however, these are the reason it appears on the lists of electronic auctions—albeit indirectly. To avoid misunderstanding: this is not a hammer due to debts, nor is it being hunted by servicers. As the column learns, it is found—formally—in the position of debtor, with a private individual as the party initiating the auction, because she and the Church are co-owners, each holding 50%, of a “prime” plot in Thessaloniki. In this auction, scheduled for 28 January 2026, in the position of “defendant–co-owner–party against whom the auction is directed,” appears the Legal Entity of Public Law under the name “Church of Greece,” headquartered on Iasiou Street in Athens. The entire procedure is based on a recent decision of the Multi-Member Court of First Instance of Thessaloniki, ordering the partition of the plot. It is a complete and buildable plot of 310 sq.m. in the municipality of Thessaloniki, on Polyxenis Antoniou Street, at the borders of the historic center and Ano Poli, near the Ministry of Macedonia–Thrace. Among the scenarios examined in the valuation report was its division, which was not advantageous, while the preferred solution proposed was either selling it as a whole or exploiting it by constructing a multi-story building and distributing the resulting horizontal properties. And so we arrived at the auction, which will take place with a starting price of €402,000. As for the ownership titles, they go as far back as a Royal Decree from 1952. In New York, Petros Pappas continues to be one of the few Greek constants closely monitored by the funds in the dry-bulk market. And it’s not only the financial results of the third quarter of 2025—net income $18.5 million, EBITDA $73.6 million, and an average daily charter rate of $16,634/day—that drew attention. Pappas’ philosophy continues to be read like a manual of financial discipline: the 19th consecutive dividend, steadily $0.11/share (with cumulative returns of $13.12/share since 2021), and above all, dedication to value creation through streamlining the share base. There aren’t many Greek shipowners talked about at trading desks for their buybacks, but Star Bulk has already “burned” about 5 million shares, investing $82.1 million, while another “wallet” of $91.4 million remains available. On Wall Street, this translates as follows: “Pappas knows what his stock is worth and buys when others hesitate.” It is the classic recipe of value operators who are not afraid of volatility, as long as the balance sheet can withstand it. At the same time, Pappas does not miss the chance to buy tonnage when prices are right. The three Kamsarmax newbuilding resales from a Chinese shipyard, delivering in Q3 2026, are read by analysts as a targeted bet on the fleet tightness ahead. The age fatigue of the global bulk fleet is now a given, while regulatory uncertainty—from U.S.–China fee measures to the postponed decision on the IMO Net Zero Framework—works more in favor of strong balance sheets than against them. The week in shipbuilding confirms a pattern that, on Wall Street, is now considered structural: Greek shipowners act as the most consistent source of demand for new tonnage in sectors with different cycles and risk profiles. In bulkers, Atlantic Bulk Carriers is methodically expanding its footprint with four new supramaxes in China—continuation of an order sequence reflecting confidence in future freight rates despite volatility. Pricing at $33.75 million per unit places the company in the “value buyers” zone, exploiting stable construction costs before new inflationary pressures appear. The moves by Danaos and Oceanbulk in container ships reveal a parallel reading of the market: feeder orders remain strong, as supply chains are being reconfigured and regional feedering gains importance. The fact that Danaos is closing a six-vessel 1,800-teu series at a yard specializing in LPG carriers shows the Chinese industry is seeking more flexible capacity use. Meanwhile, Oceanbulk’s two 3,100-teu ships indicate that Greek owners are operating in the “mid-size box” category, where the greatest supply–demand balance is expected after 2026. In the tanker market, VLCC orders have increased in intensity and frequency. Maran Tankers returns with four new vessels at Hanwha Ocean, while a parallel European order at HD Hyundai shipyards shows the crude-oil market is renewing a fleet that has aged faster than the historical average. Prices at $128–130 million indicate that shipyards have regained bargaining power and owners are pricing in resilient earnings over the next four years. The appearance of two LNG carriers in HD KSOE’s books is the exception proving the rule: the LNG market remains conservative with new orders. Workings and backstage movements at the headquarters of the International Maritime Organization, where Vassilis Kikilias represents the country ahead of the electoral process for Category A, in which Greece aims for first place. Given that the IMO is the maritime arm of the UN, what I can tell you is that in the days before the elections, interesting diplomatic games take place with votes and balances as bargaining chips. The Greek delegation has a clear goal: to remind partners of Greece’s role in international shipping—not as a given, but as a responsibility it wants to continue serving. In private meetings, the minister repeated the spirit of his speech: respect for procedures, commitment to cooperation, and a discreet but clear reminder that “Greeks are people of the sea.” The three-member delegation of the Single Resolution Board (SRB) in Athens, led by the well-dressed Czech gentleman and the exceptionally discreet Asian-origin lady, did not hide their enthusiasm after their meetings with the managements of Greek banks. SRB visits are never “courtesy calls” or filled with pleasantries. They arrive with a pre-prepared questionnaire seeking gaps in MREL capital adequacy, the ability for rapid asset transfers, and the readiness of IT systems to operate under emergency conditions. Particular attention this year was paid to the cross-border activities of Greek banks. It appears the inspection results were absolutely satisfactory—something they reportedly did not hide in their final assessment. Aegean’s market capitalization reached €1.3 billion, as it closely follows the trajectory of major European airlines hoping for an end to the war in Ukraine. The European aviation index Stoxx Europe Total Market Airlines recorded another rise yesterday (+1.91%) and on a weekly basis its gains exceeded +5.40%. The index is composed of shares of 10 airlines (Ryanair, IAG, Lufthansa, EasyJet, Air France–KLM, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Wizzair, Finnair, Enter Air, and Norse Atlantic), all of which always trade at valuations lower than justified by their figures, as the sector is extremely sensitive to climate or geopolitical shifts. Over the past week—since even faint echoes of peace have been heard—there has been significant capital inflow into the aviation sector, and Aegean is benefiting from this trend. On 19 November, Aegean’s share price was €13.14; yesterday we saw it at €14.60. In last Monday’s session, 158 thousand shares changed hands; on Tuesday the number nearly doubled to 257 thousand, and yesterday, Wednesday, exceeded 100 thousand shares. AEGEAN continues to stand out for its cash position, holding €379 million in net cash, while implementing an ambitious investment plan that will allow it to spread its wings even to India. High-level international delegations have recently been visiting Sunlight’s factory in Xanthi. Recently, a French delegation led by the French Consul General in Thessaloniki visited the facility, while a few weeks earlier, there had been a large visit of Defense Attachés from 23 countries across 5 continents. The close timing and nature of these two visits are not considered coincidental. France, as the second-largest market for industrial batteries in Europe, represents a strategic market for Sunlight, which simultaneously maintains a long-standing international presence in the market for energy solutions for defense applications. The Greek multinational group Sunlight is rapidly strengthening its role in the new international environment, where energy independence, security, and technological innovation are acquiring decisive importance. Excluding Intralot, which we mentioned above (-17.27% at €0.92) and its issues with the British budget, which dragged down all shares of the Kokkalis Group in its decline, yesterday’s session was a victory for balanced growth. The sixth consecutive upward session pushed the General Index above 2,100 points (2,106.9, +0.94%) with increased trading value of €311.55 million, including €70.6 million in pre-agreed block trades. Banks performed well and raised the pace, but the rise spread across almost all blue-chip stocks, with a clear protagonist being the DEI (Public Power Corporation) share (+2.29% at €7.19), for which investment firms are publishing a series of positive reports these days. Eurobank (+3.62% at €3.52) had many supporters yesterday, and trading in the stock approached €70 million (€49.6 million in blocks). National Bank (+3.38% at €13.06) and Piraeus (+2.31% at €7.19) also raised expectations high, while Alpha (+0.86% at €3.64) continues upward steadily without spikes. Notable is the performance of TITAN, which again reached the price of €45.6 (+1.22%). The mere publication of the news immediately knocked NVIDIA’s stock down by -6%. However, the consequences are broader. Zuckerberg’s Meta (Facebook) announced that it chose Google’s TPU chips instead of Nvidia’s GPUs. In doing so, it broke the monopoly that Nvidia had built in AI infrastructure. Nvidia immediately issued a press release expressing its “enthusiasm” for “Google’s success,” while simultaneously losing $250 billion in market capitalization. At the same time, it reminded that “we continue to supply Google,” since Google still depends on Nvidia’s H100 and GB200 chips for the most demanding AI tasks. Nvidia did not want to attack its best customer directly, despite its “infidelity.” For this reason, it made sure to remind the market that its own chips offer “greater performance and flexibility.” It aimed to warn every other hyperscaler and every company considering following Meta’s example. But for the rest of the market, the message is clear: Nvidia’s dominance is being challenged. Its stock lost 11% in ten days. Google’s TPUs are cheaper, may be limited in certain functions, but competition has knocked on the door of costly Nvidia, and this is just the beginning of another war at the heart of Artificial Intelligence. The submission of the 2026 Budget by the Labor government in the UK targets all those who have chosen London as a taxation base for their income. Savers and property income earners will face a straight tax increase of 2 percentage points on income from interest, rents, and dividends. This means that taxes on savings income start at 22%, rise to 42%, and reach 47%. Dividend tax rates rise to 10.75% for basic-rate taxpayers and go up to 35.75% at higher scales. Chancellor Reeves has budgeted an additional £500 million per year in tax revenues from savings and property income, and an additional £1.2 billion from dividends. For decades, the London market attracted income-focused investors precisely because of the large number of companies paying generous dividends every year. Clearly, these developments also concern Greeks who have purchased apartments in London to collect rent, as they now face a new headache. The tax increase comes in a context of rising inflation, high living costs, and increasing financial pressures. Explore related questions

Title: The Bull Case for Vaalco Energy and Its African Assets

During his thirty-eight year career he worked on six-continents in field and… More Info Vaalco Energy (NYSE:EGY) is small cap, Houston, Texas-based producer of oil and gas. Its original focus was offshore in the African country of Gabon, but a few years ago it diversified through a beneficial merger that expanded its global footprint. The company delivered a strong Q-4, 2023 earnings report that included news of its further diversification and entry into Côte d'Ivoire. The stock rallied to nearly $8.00 per share following the release of that report. A mixed report for Q-2 that year took the wind out of the company's sails, and thus began the long slide to the current $3.33 level. Now the Q-3 report is out, and there could be some reason for optimism for a rebound in the company’s shares, despite a miss on EPS and revenue. At a glance, the company trades at low multiples and is currently well below its 200 Day SMA of $3.90 per share. This bodes well for finding a favorable recommendation on EGY. In this article, we will dig into the particulars on EGY and come up with an investment recommendation for the stock. First we will take a quick look at the macro picture for oil. The crude oil macro The oversupply narrative is dominating trading in upstream equities. Crude oil has fallen about 30% thus far this year and may not have yet tested a bottom. Compounding current sluggishness is the war premium that had added back ~$10.00 to the price has leaked away as two of the three international hotbeds of belligerence-Israel/Gaza, and Ukraine/Russia, have shown signs of slowing to a simmer recently, a step down from outright hostilities. Peace, while a noble objective, is not good for business in oil and gas, as fears of a supply interruption keep traders long futures contracts in times of belligerence. When things calm down, the contracts are dumped on the market and must find a home, at a price. One spot worth keeping an eye on is Venezuela, as the U.S. turns the screws on the Maduro regime. A war in our hemisphere, so near the booming Guyanese ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) Stabroeck project, could have profound consequences. Geopolitical volatility makes it important to pick your entry points carefully when investing in upstream oil and gas companies. There is good news on the horizon for those who take the plunge, however. Fortunately, demand remains strong and has decades to run if the new forecast from the International Energy Agency (IEA) is any guide. Fears of stranded barrels being written off on oil companies' balance sheets are less prevalent than a few years ago. The thesis for Vaalco Vaalco has been growing production since its merger with TransGlobe in 2022. This transformed the company from sole reliance on its Gabonese assets to a diversified player with a number of levers to pull globally. A move last year into Côte d'Ivoire was viewed favorably, and EGY just farmed into another offshore block in that country. In the short run, the company's focus has been on ramping up production in its Egyptian concession and Gabon. Results have been uneven with production progress and efficiency increases in Egypt, offset by a production turnaround and an FPSO refurbishment, combined with rig-related drilling delays in Gabon. This has pushed expected production from a new drilling campaign to the right, adversely impacting the stock. As the slide below notes, the shutdown and the near completion of the FPSO refurbishment, and then next the arrival of, Borr Drilling's Norve jack up is underway and should spud the first well sometime this month. Vaalco trades at a low EV/EBITDA multiple-2.8X, and a low flowing barrel valuation- $19K per barrel. Analysts here and on Wall Street rank the company as a strong buy. Price targets are $10.00 per share, but EPS estimates point to small losses over the next couple of quarters, which could delay any rally in the stock. The company has a quarter of its Q-4 production hedged at $ 60 and plans to increase this to about half. In 2026, EGY plans to hedge about 40% of its daily output. The company is returning capital to shareholders through a 6.5% dividend yield. The company has a small amount of LT debt and has been implementing a capital reduction and cost-cutting program that should improve cash flow and production. Catalysts for EGY An explorer's job is to find oil and gas. Full stop. Operating oil and gas assets is also enhanced by the adjacency of other assets. Sometimes this is called critical mass. It enables cost optimization through several avenues. Gaining operatorship over a block where seismic has already been shot for $3 million seems like a reasonably derisked proposition to me. Someone thought Block CI-705 offshore, Côte d'Ivoire, was prospective enough to shoot seismic, which isn't cheap, so it could be like the last person to pull the handle on a slot machine. Or it could lead to nothing. That's exploration. Dry holes are instructive as well. TotalEnergies, (NYSE: TTE) drilled a test in 2021, and DH'd it. Why did they drill it? Why does anyone think this area might be prospective? Well, if you go back 400 million years and put the puzzle pieces together to form Gondwana, you find the area now known as Côte d'Ivoire fits nicely adjacent to the areas known as Guyana and Suriname. That should cement it in your head as to what the Geo-types have in the back of their minds at EGY. This sort of thinking about the Atlantic Margin has led to the well-publicized discoveries in Guyana, Suriname, and Namibia. Snapshot of Atlantic basin (Google Maps) This is all down the road a piece, even in the success case. In the near term, we have the upcoming drilling campaigns in Gabon, Egypt, and the Baobab field in Côte d'Ivoire -EGY's legacy position from the TransGlobe merger. No catalyst discussion would be complete without at least a mention of EGY's 60% interest in Block P, offshore Equatorial Guinea. As of this date, a Plan of Development has been approved, and a Joint Operating Agreement is in place. Although Venus (Not to be confused with Total's Venus discovery offshore Namibia) As the slide below discusses, there is future prospectivity in this block. And the two producers and one injector needed to bring on Venus could be done in 2026. Canada is taking a backseat after several successes in the company's Cardium and Mannville plays in Alberta, with no further drilling planned until 2026. The slide below shows the 2.50-mile horizontal section performing nearly as well as the 3.0-mile type curve. Q-3, 2025 for EGY Most notably, the company hit the upper range of most production estimates, but cash flow suffered due to softness in Brent prices. Guidance for the full year expects 5% uplift YoY. Capex was reduced due to the issues with Gabon to optimize cash flow for the quarter. Even so, the company had to call upon its revolver for current expenses. Otherwise, the company has no debt. Company filings Risks to the thesis for EGY Even great deals can get cheaper. Picking an entry point can be frustrating as fundamentals continue to weaken. That's the era we are in right now. As I laid out in the Macro, there are many moving pieces driving oil prices, and most of them are not supportive. No matter how good the price of EGY stock looks relative to the recent past, it can always get cheaper when the market turns against upstream investors. Your takeaway EGY’s report reads pretty well. And EGY management is due some deference for their experience in West African operations, going back decades. Their balance sheet management also speaks well for the company. Borrowing money to support operations when interruptions in other projects present cash flow hiccups is no big deal. The company retains ample liquidity, assuming refurbishment with the FPSO goes according to plan. In my view, Vaalco's strong balance sheet, prospects for improving cash flow in the next year, and low multiples, put a buy target squarely on the company at its current level. The company is currently trading in a range well below its 50 and 200 day SMAs, which is probably more induced by the depressed pricing of Brent than anything else. I am giving EGY a Strong for investors with a high risk profile, seeking capital growth and competitive shareholder returns.

Title: I love the second-gen Meta AI glasses. Newbies should buy the first-gen Meta Black Friday deal, and here's why
URL: https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-love-the-second-gen-meta-ai-glasses-newbies-should-buy-the-first-gen-meta-black-friday-deal-and-heres-why

I'd definitely recommend Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) or Oakley Meta Vanguard, but if you're new to smart glasses, start on the first-gen ground floor. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta wants to clear out stock of its first-generation Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses. It's launched Black Friday deals for its old Wayfarer models, with its G15 Green and Clear Wayfarers at $238 ($60 off) and its more popular Matte Black Wayfarers with Polarized Graphite lenses at $263 ($66 off). Meta glasses have never gotten a major sale in the 2+ years since launch, making this a rare opportunity. In some ways, this deal is a trap. Meta just launched its Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses and Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses, both of which I gave glowing reviews. I particularly loved how Meta improved battery life this generation, while the first-gen models have shorter battery life by comparison. Here's the problem: the new Ray-Bans start at $379, or $409 with polarized lenses, while Vanguard launched at $499, and I don't expect either device to get a major discount until 2027, based on past history. If you're shopping for your first smart glasses, it makes much more sense to buy the first-gen glasses for less and see if you like them or not; they'll last you until Meta's third-generation glasses in a couple of years. or: Wayfarer (Gen 1) Polarized Graphite: $329 $263.20 at Best Buy Android Central verdict: ★★★★ The original Ray-Ban Meta glasses blew up in a way no one expected, selling millions of units on the strength of its high-res photography, open-ear audio, and Meta AI insights. You get a natural fit that blends in with other sunglasses, letting you capture shots organically by tapping a button or ask the AI for insights, all with your phone in your pocket. Also at: Amazon | Meta If you compare the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 vs. Gen 1, the difference isn't as stark as you'd assume. The photo resolution and FoV, storage space, IPX4 water resistance, mic and speaker quality, Wi-Fi/ Bluetooth connectivity, and apps are unchanged, while the weight is virtually the same. The new glasses do give you a video resolution boost from 1080p to 3K and a couple of extra hours of battery life. But is it worth spending an extra $150 or so for the 2nd-gen polarized glasses, just to get these two perks? Equally important, Meta has already brought its best second-generation features to its first-gen glasses, making them feel new. Vanguard glasses introduced Garmin integration in October, autocapturing videos at important race moments and reading out your health stats from your wrist; Meta brought this feature to Gen 1 glasses the next month. Likewise, Vanguard glasses added improved video stabilization algorithms to make in-motion sporty videos look smoother, and Meta brought the feature to first-gen glasses in November without telling anyone. Meta isn't interested in gatekeeping its features to make you upgrade, which means you can buy the last-gen Ray-Ban deal without any FOMO. The shorter battery life, you'll have to live with. But smart glasses fans lived with the 4-hour maximum for two years; you can too to get this Black Friday price! Or, if you can't, splurge on the full-price newer glasses without regrets!

Title: Coffee Break: Nvidia’s Narrative Breaking Down?

Time Published: 2025-11-26T19:00:49Z

Nvidia’s narrative took a major hit this week due to multiple factors including the emergence of a credible rival, OpenAI’s struggles, and a trade war pincer that has them caught between Trump and China. Is a Government Backstop the Bull Case? Nvidia’s narrative, which it kicked off with the launch of Ampere architecture and A100 chip in 2020, subsumed any competing story-lines in the post-pandemic American stock markets in 2022, and engulfed the entire American economy under Trump. Nvidia’s narrative that Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini ARE the future of technology and the global economy has made them the world’s largest corporation by market cap. The Trump administration may be all-in with Nvidia’s narrative and may be signaling its willingness to backstop the industry to prevent the AI bubble popping. Paypal mafioso and Trump tech czar David Sacks had previously indicated the government would not be backstopping OpenAI earlier this month. I argued elsewhere that Sacks’ tweet contributed to the downturn in AI stocks we saw in the first weeks of this month. But on the 24th, Sacks seemed to signal a change in his (very influential) thinking, in response to a Wall Street Journal piece headlined, “How the U.S. Economy Became Hooked on AI Spending and subtitled, “Growth has been bolstered by data-center investment and stock-market wealth. A reversal could raise the risk of recession.” According to today’s WSJ, AI-related investment accounts for half of GDP growth. A reversal would risk recession. We can’t afford to go backwards. — David Sacks (@DavidSacks) November 24, 2025 Paired with the White House’s executive order titled “Launching the Genesis Mission” released the same day, many took this as bullish news for Nvidia’s narrative and the larger AI bubble. The closest thing I could find to an action word in the EO was this promise to: …build an integrated AI platform to harness Federal scientific datasets — the world’s largest collection of such datasets, developed over decades of Federal investments — to train scientific foundation models and create AI agents to test new hypotheses, automate research workflows, and accelerate scientific breakthroughs. Critics of the Nvidia narrative will of course point out that when a government backstop is the bull case, the bubble is in trouble. Maybe that’s why the a handful of naysayers who’ve been fighting the tide, are now being joined by some major investors who are putting their money where the critics’ keyboards have been. Team Bear Beefs Up Pioneering Nvidia bears like AI scientist Gary Marcus and journalist Ed Zitron have now been joined by notable investors including the “Big Short” contrarian Michael Burry and billionaire Stanley “I killed the Pound” Druckenmiller who sold all 214,060 of his funds’ Nvidia shares. Marcus and Zitron remain opinion leaders in the space, however. Marcus is currently dealing with the emergence of a class of rival AI experts who’ve been on the AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) bandwagon and are now getting off. AGI is the patent nonsense that LLMs are just a few months away from creating super-intelligent, self-replicating machines. Naturally, belief in AGI has been the conventional wisdom in Silicon Vally for the last couple of years and continues to be a big part of the bulls’ case for the Nvidia narrative. Marcus has taken lots of heat for calling bullshit on LLMs as the road to AGI from the get go, and is now expressing mixed feelings about the big names who are joining him on the critical side. Those names include Meta’s Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun and OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever. As for Ed Zitron, his latest “The Hater’s Guide To NVIDIA” is well worth the subscription price and the estimated 54 minute reading time. It includes an excellent, concise explanation of why Nvidia has become the hero of the Nvidia narrative which has reshaped the U.S. economy: Back in 2006, NVIDIA launched CUDA, a software layer that lets you run (some) software on (specifically) NVIDIA graphics cards, and over time this has grown into a massive advantage for the company. The thing is, GPUs are great for parallel processing – essentially spreading a task across multiple, by which I mean thousands, of processor cores at the same time – which means that certain tasks run faster than they would on, say, a CPU. While not every task benefits from parallel processing, or from having several thousand cores available at the same time, the kind of math that underpins LLMs is one such example. CUDA is proprietary to NVIDIA, and while there are alternatives (both closed- and open-source), none of them have the same maturity and breadth. Pair that with the fact that Nvidia’s been focused on the data center market for longer than, say, AMD, and it’s easy to understand why it makes so much money. There really isn’t anyone who can do the same thing as NVIDIA, both in terms of software and hardware, and certainly not at the scale necessary to feed the hungry tech firms that demand these GPUs. Anyway, back in 2019 NVIDIA acquired a company called Mellanox for $6.9 billion, beating off other would-be suitors, including Microsoft and Intel. Mellanox was a manufacturer of high-performance networking gear, and this acquisition would give NVIDIA a stronger value proposition for data center customers. It wanted to sell GPUs — lots of them — to data center customers, and now it could also sell the high-speed networking technology required to make them work in tandem. This is relevant because it created the terms under which NVIDIA could start selling billions (and eventually tens of billions) of specialized GPUs for AI workloads. … Because nobody else has really caught up with CUDA, NVIDIA has a functional monopoly… NVIDIA has been printing money, quarter after quarter, going from a meager $7.192 billion in total revenue in the third (calendar year) quarter of 2023 to an astonishing $50 billion in just data center revenue (that’s where the GPUs are) in its most recent quarter, for a total of $57 billion in revenue, and the company projects to make $63 billion to $67 billion in the next quarter. But never fear, Ziton also puts a stake through the heart of the Nvidia narrative over the course of several thousand words. Here’s a key point: NVIDIA makes so much money, and it makes it from a much smaller customer base than most companies, because there are only so many entities that can buy thousands of chips that cost $50,000 or more each. Zitron cites pseudonymous finance poster “Just Dario” as someone who’s provided key insights into the workings of Nvidia and Dario’s latest piece on the company is worth reading in full, but the TL;DR explanation of Dario’s role in the larger Nvidia narrative wars can be grasped from glancing at these tweets about whether or not Enron is a valid comparison point for Nvidia: Nvidia says it’s not Enron. I actually agree with them, they are Envidia https://t.co/8zN308lZKK pic.twitter.com/IeahPNSd4Q — JustDario 🏊‍♂️ (@DarioCpx) November 25, 2025 I should note that this pretty much unknown (and I suspect AI-using Substack) writer Shanaka Anslem Perera got the credit from Yahoo Finance with triggering Nvidia’s now infamous “we’re not Enron” memo. Yahoo also quoted “Jim Chanos, who is famous for predicting the fall of Enron, (who) thinks the comparison between Nvidia and Lucent bears weight.” “They’re [Nvidia is] putting money into money-losing companies in order for those companies to order their chips,” Chanos said. As for “Big Short” Burry, his new Substack is a bit rich for my blood, although serious investors will likely find it a bargain, but his latest contribution to Nvidia’s narrative involves comparing Nvidia to Cisco before the dot.com bust: Michael Burry's case against Nvidia: pic.twitter.com/XafV3SLYVT — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) November 26, 2025 This adds to Burry’s previous X.com post alleging that AI industry accounting practices of “understating depreciation by extending useful life of assets artificially boosts earnings (are) one of the more common frauds of the modern era.” And of course, Burry’s close to a billion-dollar bet against Nvidia’s narrative has impacted our story as well. There’s also been a spate of bad news for Nvidia in the tech business press. Two More Problems for the Nvidia Narrative Two headlines from The Information neatly summarize the latest issues Nvidia is facing in the marketplace, unfortunately, it’s an expensive subscription only newsletter and we’ll have to look elsewhere for explanations: The talks also involve Meta renting chips from Google Cloud as early as next year and are part of Google’s broader push to get customers to adopt its tensor processing units (TPUs) – used for AI workloads – in their own data centers, the report said, citing people involved in the talks.” Nvidia responded with a statement that is getting mocked online. ByteDance bought more Nvidia chips than ‌any other Chinese firm in 2025 as it raced to secure computing power for its billion-plus ‌users amid concerns Washington could curb supply, according to the report. The reported ban underscores Beijing’s efforts to reduce reliance on U.S. technology, a campaign that has intensified as Washington tightens curbs on exports of advanced semiconductors to China. The Mid-Wits Weigh In No debate in 2025 would be complete without one of the Abundance bros weighing in. Naturally Ezra Klein’s “Abundance” co-author Derek Thomas (co-writing with Understanding AI founder Timothy B. Lee is coming down in the middle with “Six reasons to think there’s an AI bubble — and six reasons not to” and shrewdly saves the bull case for its paying customers. Talk about knowing your audience. The Real Bulls Include Jim Cramer and AGI Crazytown’s Finest But I’ll leave the real bull case to the legendary CNBC commentator Jim Cramer (I should note that the Inverse Jim Cramer ETF has been getting killed lately). His case boils down to growth: I am a huge believer in growth stocks, and …growth stocks are what draws me to the hyperscalers for my travel trust. Now we own many, many stocks from other universes drug stocks, aerospace materials, data center builders. They have long term growth stories, but they’re not turbocharged with the resources of these gigantic companies. That’s what always brings me back to the Mag-7. These stocks are prominent because of their success. The companies they represent have bountiful profits, which is why they could rise to their lofty trillionaire status in the first place. It’s why I don’t kick them out when they’re down in fact. Or in fact, it’s why I might buy them for the trust. But the far more entertaining bull case for the Nvidia narrative is made by Utopia believers like Tomas Pueyo who is helping his 119,000 Substack subscribers prepare for a post-scarcity Utopia brought about by “super-intelligence.” Admittedly, I have an immediate and utter disdain for anyone pitching imminent Utopia but a couple of gummies and Pueyo’s stuff becomes quite entertaining. Here’s a taste from his latest, “AI: How Do We Avoid Societal Collapse and Build a Utopia?“: In the previous article, we saw that we’ll eventually live in a utopia, a world of full abundance and without the conflicts over scarce resources that have plagued humanity throughout history. Well then. But lest readers think Mr. Pueyo isn’t concerned with the obstacles in our path, there’s more: intelligence will not be infinite until there’s infinite energy and infinite compute, which will also need plenty of raw materials and land. So the scarcity of intelligence might not even be completely eliminated until more of these inputs are sufficiently abundant. Assuming AIs still serve humans, how will they prioritize? They will need a signal of what matters most to humans. How will humans convey that? Through money. … So it’s very unlikely that we’re going to get rid of capitalism. We need the price signal to convey the optimal allocation of capital. But in that world, where humans are not working anymore because they’ve been fully automated by AIs more intelligent than themselves, how do you decide how much money each person should have? I’ll leave it up to readers who are really dying to know just how many angels are dancing on the top of his pinhead to read more of his work. Just be aware that the Nvidia narrative bears are up against a whole lot of people who really really really want to believe and are clapping as hard as they can to keep Tinkerbell alive the AI bubble inflated. Unfortunately for the bulls, and Nvidia’s narrative. AI slop is having very real world impacts. The kind people notice. pic.twitter.com/bnATXesA3D — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) November 26, 2025 Will Americans take comfort in their 401K wealth effect if they can’t even go into a happy turkey coma after Thanksgiving dinner because Nvidia’s narrative led to AI slop getting served to the table? Posts Related to Nvidia’s Narrative: Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. RE: …intelligence will not be infinite until there’s infinite energy and infinite compute… It sounds like Mr. Pueyo could use a refresher on the concept of infinity. These AI humpers really are whacked out of their gourds, aren’t they? Krell machine or bust (h/t Dr. Morbius). The Krell data center. Pretty prescient. Morbius to Ostrow and Adams underground, pointing off into the distance: “Twenty billions,” points in the opposite direction, “twenty billions.” Adams, “Listen. Trades opening and closing.” Morbius, in reply, “And they never rest. This is one of their funding vehicles. You can feel the extracted rents rising. Look down here. Look down gentlemen, are you afraid of the deplorables?” Morbius points upwards: “Seventy-eight hundred tranches. And four hundred other funding vehicles like this one.” Later Morbius is to sum it up as: “The harnessed power of an exploited planetary system.” Beware the Monsters From the App! Lol. Gotta say: that is one of my fave scenes in the whole film. I remember thinking when I really looked at those Krell doorways that the set designer for the film had read Lovecraft. Those doors are shaped like Lovecraft described the unnamed aliens from “At the Mountains of Madness.” They too suffered a terrible doom due to their hubris and overconfidence in creating the shoggoths. Monsters from the Id indeed. It’s superb. Every time I see it, and listen to it, I marvel. One thing about tensor processing units is they use way less energy on inference. At least that might help make money on AI. ..Unless we all end up paying for openAI oracle etc. electricity bills. Well, ok, it’ll bring down, but certainly not eliminate, the overhead going to the utility cos. Won’t do anything about paying for the silicon, the optical networking gear, the programming, the training, the $1M+ salaries, and most importantly, the profit margin needed to pay back the gigantic pile of capital they’re in the process of lighting on fire. And of course, one only trains the model once (in principle) and when it’s ready tens, hundreds or even thousands of copies are made to distribute the load of inference (for there may be tens of thousands of request per second). Maybe it’s just me, but even WITH infinite compute and infinite energy, I don’t think we’d be capable of hitting infinite intelligence. I don’t think we have it in us. We’ll probably hit infinite bullshit first, if we’re not almost there already. The universe may not contain infinite energy and we cannot have infinite compute unless compute is absolutley efficient. As to BS, well, that is open ended and without physical limits Based on Zitron and Darion’s summaries it appears Nvidia and AI are headed for the mother of all busts. NVIDIA’s scheme is: Nvidia invests in some company, say two billion dollars. That company then buys a couple billion dollars of Nvidia GPU’s. Now using the GPU’s as collateral, the company borrows 20 billion. It then buys 15 billion of Nvidia GPUS. Now it goes back and borrows another 20 billion using the last twenty billion worth of gpus. or it signs a contract with OpenAI for $50 billion in compute services, and then uses that contract to borrow 40 billion to buy another 30 billion in Nvidia gpus. So, number always goes up for everybody as long as somebody can still borrow money. Some VC said at the current rate, all the VC money will be gone in six quarters ($200 billion ? I forget exactly). So when that day comes and the whole thing collapses, the bankruptcies will be phenomenal. I bet Nvidia drops by half in value, and the NYSE goes down by 30%. OpenAI has announced 1.4 trillion in spending in the next 15 years, when it makes maybe 12 billion a year currently. I think in 2027, if it lives that long, it needs a 100 billion just for that year. One interesting link I’ve read that I don’t think was mentioned was this article: https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/822011/coreweave-debt-data-center-ai aka (“I looked into CoreWeave and the abyss gazed back: Meet the company Nvidia is propping up”) This is an excellent case study for one of the companies Nvidia is propping up. Possibly the best quote that guarantees a bust is as follows: “These [Nvidia] investments [in CoreWeave] are not circular; they are complementary,” CoreWeave’s Davis wrote. “This is about an entire ecosystem all rowing in the same direction to accelerate the AI economy. There’s nothing circular about it. Rather, these partnerships are about accelerating innovation and adoption. We are, collectively, defining the next-generation operating system for civilization.” Lemmings one and all… Another interesting point mentioned was that at the end of July, Nvidia owned $3.9B in non-marketable securities–probably investments in a number of companies like CoreWeave. So I thought, I wonder where Nvidia is now on these securitiesthat they just released a new quarter of data?… $8.2B or over 100% growth in 3 months. My son is in intro accounting and a major AI user. I asked him if they looked at many corporations’ balance sheets in his class. He said not many. I said, go look at NVDA and tell me if you think they’re a $5T company. Seems like a big bust in on the horizon although I easily could see another “socialism for the rich” scenario in the offing. The companies building these data centers for companies like OpenAI might be the first to fail. They are taking on huge debt levels to build these things, with often nothing more than the contracted promise to buy compute services as the collateral behind that debt. Like Oracle, who signed a $300 billion dollar contract with OpenAI to supply 4.5 GigaWatts of computing power, deliverable Jan 1, 2027. Oracle hired Crusoe to build the Stargate Abilene data center, which I believe last month the first of eight buildings was turned over to Oracle with 200 MW of power. Another seven have to be built, equipped and made operational in the next 12 months, lol. The 4GW power substation hasn’t even really started construction yet, Oracle needs to come up with $40 billion just for the GPUs, and has to start paying Crusoe $1 billion dollars a month for the next 15 years for the construction. Good question as to where Larry is going to find the money. The other thing is these contracts are worded such that if the data center is not completed to the specs, the counter-party can walk away. So if, as expected, Oracle fails to build out all the gpu power OpenAI contracted, and Altman walks, who is Oracle going to be able to find to buy the compute power ? Nobody. Then there’s the problem that OpenAI won’t have the money to pay Oracle anyway. Hundreds of billions of dollars are being incinerated, and when the flames go out, the cold will be unreal. Maybe the IDF is helping him out with some of the jewelry they stole from Palestinians. I know that gold has risen a lot but not enough to cover this hole completely. Maybe the precious gems? A good friend who has been working in the US power utility sector recently left that industry for headhunting. He is specialising in recruiting the people required to design and project manage the power connections for AI datacentres. He said over coffee, I might need another specialism. I told him he did…. There really isn’t anyone who can do the same thing as NVIDIA, both in terms of software and hardware, and certainly not at the scale necessary to feed the hungry tech firms that demand these GPUs. Expect that Nvidia doesn’t make the GPUs themselves. They are a (great) hardware and (very poor) software design company. Their “assets” are the engineers, tools, knowhow and of course IP surrounding these chips. So, if the topic of a massive bailout comes up, wouldn’t it just be cheaper to liquidate the company, and sell the tools and re-hire everyone into a new venture? Nvidia’s real lock is CUDA, the software that you use to drive the gpu’s. It is of course proprietary and nobody has anything remotely close. I’m sure anyone who even thinks of trying will run into a thicket of patents surrounded by a moat guarded by an army of 10,000 patent lawyers. https://www.eetimes.com/after-three-years-modulars-cuda-alternative-is-ready/ CUDA alternatives. One of the most successful has been the open-source project ApacheTVM. TVM’s main aim is to enable AI to run efficiently on diverse hardware by automating kernel fusion, but generative AI proved to be a technical challenge, since algorithms are larger and more complex than for older computer vision applications. Generative AI algorithms are also more hardware-specific (like FlashAttention). TVM’s core contributors formed a company called OctoAI, which developed a generative AI inference stack for enterprise clusters, but it was acquired recently by Nvidia, casting some doubt on the project’s future. Another widely known technology, OpenCL, is a standard designed to enable code portability between GPUs and other hardware types. It has been broadly adopted in mobile and embedded devices. However, critics of this standard (including Lattner) point to its lack of agility to keep up with fast-moving AI technology, in part because it is driven by a “co-opetition” of competing companies who generally decline to share anything about future hardware features. Other commercial projects of this nature are still in the early stages, Lattner said. Worth noting that CUDA is not for AI only. To give a real life usage egzample, my brother is a CAD specialist contractor, models architecture and interiors for developers and furniture producers etc. He bought his third Nvidia GPU now because there is a lot of software that requires it for speeding up or automating certain operations like cloth physics (very useful in interior modeling). The GPUs return their price manifold saving him a lot of time. This is true. I currently am involved in high performance computing (undergraduate research) and we often discuss gpu vs cpu for the calculations we are doing. Any time you have a parallelizable problem, ur gonna wanna consider gpu. They originally became big in gaming, because most image processing is inherently parallel. And now that we cant just design smaller faster chips, theres a motivation to find more ways to speedup like parallel processing. We also optimize for memory in my lab. One of the grad students was talking about how cuda doesnt have any way to parallelize sparse or banded matrices. They actually just pass everything to cpu. Which is something they could work on. NVDA chip buyers need more years (if not decades) to pay off their notes that capitalized their “hyper scaling” than NVDA PUs will be state of art. There are efficiencies…. The short term answer to AI is reduce the cost to train your llModles. Then reduce the run cost for compute /inference. Low case “l” not typo. LLM are often too expensive for the answer they provide. DeepSeek does this with SW. The other efficiency is in the PU’s. Which TPU may be just one. OpenAI won’t make any money ever, many NVDA customers go broke and will default a bunch of bonds. The Fed can keep solvent a lot of CDS resulting from a lot of analysts failing to question Huang and Altman. While they ignored macro economics and new disruptive product profit cycles. Bond underwriting. There are all kinds of disrupters chasing tech that will bring down the TBTF. No govt bail out, which tech firm will be first Bear Sterns, ENRON? To put a 2025 technology LLM AI into a humanoid android, approximately 4.3 m³ would be required for the hardware (Computing: 1.5 m³, Cooling: 2.0 m³, Power Supply: 0.5 m³, Connectivity: 0.3 m³). This AI must be pre-trained in data centers that require about 1600 m³ for the hardware, and between two and five of these data centers are needed for the training phase. Once trained, several of these data centers will perform the task of fine-tuning and improving the LLM model, and others will handle storage and backups. Additional data centers will surely be required for this latter task. This AI could perform local inference and fine-tuning, but it would still require connectivity to data centers for model updates (weekly/monthly), data synchronization (optional), specific tasks requiring the cloud, internet searches, complex non-time-sensitive analysis, data backups, among other things. In other words, self-replicating machines and Terminator-style robots are still a long way from becoming a reality. Great compendium as always, Nat. What a time to be alive. In a YouTube video I heard the argument that this certainly looks like a bubble, and there are lots of warning flags, but those firms mostly use their giant pile of cash to do the investing, rather than using (leveraged) debt. I can’t assess it that is totally true, but if it is, then it is a very risky bet, and given that the US economy is driven by those “Magnificent Seven”, it may not hurt the mainstream economy all that much? Of course, there are many investors who will get hurt, so that’s bad. Is this a reasonable point of contention with the bubble-story or not? It’s the pension funds and retail investors who will lose everything when the bubble pops. As a horrible old Man who was licensed to run a collection agency for more than a decade ( I actually specialized in second and third placement debts, including corporate debt) I look at the Money flows. And while NVIDIA is not as blatant a scam as WeWork was, the financial relationships between NVIDIA and its “Customers” are Peculiar, to say the least. I’m reminded of Keyne’s saying that the market can stay irrational longer than I can stay solvent, regarding the short sellers. Since Sam Altman’s ultimate contribution to society and business is going to be individualized sex porn, the only real question for the business world is, what is the monetary value as a percentage of GDP? I assume we can take OpenAI being worth $500B to some investors based on his penultimate contribution of individualized non-sex porn for all ChatGPT users’ needs for companionship and flattery as a starting point for computing the value of his ultimate contribution.

Member sign up is free and easy, and will also earn you 10% off your first order (up to $60). We're seeing Hoka markdowns from other retailers like Zappos and Dick's Sporting Goods. Across these sites, we found early discounts on some of our top-tested styles like the Gaviota 5, Bondi 9, and Clifton 10. We're noticing especially solid deals on trail shoes like the Speedgoat 6, which come in handy on winter runs when the sidewalks turn icy. Below, we've rounded up the best Hoka Black Friday deals — but be sure to grab them while they're still in stock. Also check out our full Black Friday deals hub for more editor-vetted deals across every category. I've tested dozens and dozens of Hoka styles over the years, and there really is a different pair for every person and every need. So if you're shopping with comfort and support top of mind — whether for walking, standing all day, or running — be sure to browse my thoroughly-tested guide to the best Hokas for help picking the right pair. For overpronators, this stability shoe is ultra-plush, ultra-breathable, and super lightweight. Hoka's cushy sneakers are well-loved by our reviewers, the Rincon 4 is the brand’s latest edition of one of our favorite cheap running shoes. The Clifton 10 hits the sweet spot of everything Hoka is known (and loved) for — meta rocker, cushy midsole, great ventilation — making them ideal for novice runners. The Hoka Bondi 9 are the brand’s most cushioned running shoes, built for runners prone to shin splints or knee pain, or anyone who’s on their feet all day. The Bondi 9s offer plush comfort without the bulk, with a roomy fit, soft Super Critical foam, and a breathable knit upper. The updated design of the 9s still feels stable and responsive, making it a solid choice for recovery runs or long shifts. These lightweight trail runners provide a comfortable and responsible ride with incredibly reliable traction to keep you moving fast through the mountains.

Is Google's TPU a threat to Nvidia's dominance? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Nvidia released a statement saying that it’s “delighted by Google’s success,” but said that it continues to supply AI chips to the company. The AI giant made the X post in an apparent response to the news that Meta is in talks with Google to rent its Cloud Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) in 2026 and then to purchase them the following year. This news resulted in an increase in stock prices for Alphabet, Google’s parent company, and Meta, but also saw Nvidia take a 3% hit, especially as the market probably saw this as a break on the AI giant’s monopoly on the AI chip market. We’re delighted by Google’s success — they’ve made great advances in AI and we continue to supply to Google.NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry — it’s the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done.NVIDIA offers greater…November 25, 2025 "Nvidia is a generation ahead of the industry — it's the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done," the company said on X via its Nvidia Newsroom account. "Nvidia offers greater performance, versatility, and fungibility than ASICs, which are designed for specific AI frameworks or functions." Google's Cloud TPUs are ASICs — application-specific integrated circuits — designed for AI workloads like training and inference. On the other hand, Nvidia's AI GPUs are general-purpose machines designed for parallel processing that have been repurposed for AI workloads. Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs are indeed superior to almost anything else on the market, especially in terms of versatility. Although they're primarily advertised for AI applications, they can also be used for high-performance computing, data analytics, graphics rendering and visualization, and many more. On the other hand, Google's TPUs are designed for matrix multiplication — the arithmetic operation that primarily runs most modern AI. This means that you cannot easily repurpose these chips for other purposes. However, it also gives them an advantage in AI processing, even sometimes giving them an advantage in AI workloads, especially in terms of efficiency. Meta isn't the first company to consider using Google TPUs for its AI operations. In fact, Anthropic has been using it since 2023, and the company has signed a deal to expand its contracted capacity to 1GW in 2026. But the biggest challenge for Google is the widespread adoption of its TPU chips, especially given Nvidia's huge market share. More than that, its CUDA platform is widely used in the industry, making it harder for developers to switch to Google's alternatives. However, the size of the proposed deal between Meta and Google appears large enough to threaten Nvidia's dominance in the market. While it would still be a drop in the bucket compared to Nvidia's skyrocketing revenues, it would at least show potential clients that there's a viable alternative to Team Green's GPUs. Just this thought is enough to send Nvidia's stock price sliding, and it comes so soon after the company's record highs, leading CEO Jensen Huang to say the market does not appreciate the AI GPU manufacturer.

Title: Disney Wants to ‘Break Spell’ of Guests Glued to Phones in Parks
URL: https://www.disneytouristblog.com/disney-world-guests-glued-phones-screen-time-complaints-solution/
Time Published: 2025-11-26T13:05:34Z
Full Content:
Walt Disney World fans have a lot of complaints and criticism for the company, and in a rare turn of events, the head of Imagineering agrees with them about one of the biggest problem points with the guest experience in the parks. Unfortunately, one of his proposed solutions isn’t going to be well received, but the first step is acknowledging there’s an issue. Frankly, we’re thankful to hear this. As we’ve covered in Top 10 Guest Complaints About Walt Disney World and other roundups of the biggest annual fan concerns about WDW, we’ve been receiving negative reader feedback at a far historically-high rate over the last 5 years. Essentially, since the honeymoon phase of the post-COVID reopening wore off and fans started realizing temporary changes were going to become permanent. The #4 entry on last year’s version of the biggest complaints list was “too much screen time.” Refreshing for better Lightning Lanes. Mobile Order for counter service restaurants and Merchandise Mobile Checkout to buy stuff. Checking Walk-up Waitlist for new table service availability. Looking at wait times and showtimes. And so on and so forth. It’s been our position that this is both an obvious issue and an overblown one. So many entries on the above list are entirely optional. You can opt-out of Lightning Lanes completely, there are cash registers for counter service restaurants and merchandise, ADRs can be made pre-trip, and wait times boards are throughout the park (if you even need them in the first place). On the other hand, optional might need air quotes around it. Ignore all of those app features to your own detriment, as they can help simplify and streamline your day. Not only that, but FOMO makes it difficult to opt-out of Lightning Lanes or anything else. The compulsion to check the My Disney Experience app is a direct result of the deliberate choices that Walt Disney World has made. For years, we’ve said that Walt Disney World leans too heavily on technology (ironic, since Disney is objectively awful at it) and not enough on tactile experiences. To paraphrase my favorite Walt Disney quote, “it’s people that make the dream a reality.” The best memories are formed as a result of interpersonal moments, and so much emotional resonance is derived from guests connecting with others. Even if people can’t put their finger on it, so much of what differentiates and defines the appeal of Walt Disney World is the ‘little things’ that bring them together with each other and shared spaces. Big new rides get people to take the trip, but it’s the myriad little things and those connections that convince them to return. Then, of course, there are the themed environments that Imagineering worked so hard to create. By having their faces buried in their phones while in line or strolling through the park, guests are missing so much of the defining features of Walt Disney World. It’s not just about racing from ride to ride and accomplishing those, checklist-style, with the shortest wait times possible. It’s the spaces in between–the breathing room and richly themed environments–that make Disney, Disney. If guests are overlooking that, they’re missing a lot of what separates Walt Disney World from regional parks. Walt Disney World now nudges guests towards spending way too much time with their faces buried in their phones. These new app features are great in isolation, and benefit the company by improving efficiency and cutting costs. However, the totality of all of this amounts to Walt Disney World effectively leaning into its biggest weaknesses (technology and isolation) and away from its strengths (richly themed environments and togetherness). It might look good in the quarterly financials, but all of this technology does come with a long-term cost. And now, it would seem that someone high-up in the company actually agrees with the spirit of this sentiment… Walt Disney Imagineering President Bruce Vaughn commented on exactly this issue, and how phones inhibit the guest experience in the parks. Here’s what he said: Extended reality is gonna reinforce the shared experience. A big differentiator for us is that you’re there together with friends and family and people that you care about, and every time you look have to look down at a device or a phone, it breaks that spell. If you can use extended reality, I never stop looking at the environment I’m in or at the people I’m with, it’s gonna be less disruptive. Asa Kalama, Executive Creative Director at Walt Disney Imagineering, spoke about the possibilities of the new partnership with Disney, Meta and Ray-Ban. We have a really wonderful partnership with Meta to leverage their Ray-Ban smart glasses for both guest-facing applications and also behind the scenes design applications as well. What’s great about these glasses is they’ve got cameras in them, microphones, and speakers. For guests, it allows us to put a virtual theme park guide in their ear. The glasses can enhance the ways we tell stories for our guests, unlocking a world of information about the land that they’re in. Just by looking around, I can ask questions about some of the architectural details, and I get the answer right in my ear. Maybe I wanna learn a little bit more about a merchandise item for my child. All I have to do is look at it, ask, “tell me more information about it.” Then, right in my ear, I get all of the product information. Kalama later added: “if we’re doing our jobs properly, all of the technology goes away and our guests get immersed in the story we’re trying to tell.” Another Imagineer was quick to say that Disney “is not just using technology for technology’s sake.” Instead, Disney is using technology “in service of story” they’re trying to tell. This is great sentiment, and I absolutely agree with it. The only problem is that I’ve been a Disney Adult for two decades now, and I’ve seen countless examples of the technological tail wagging the dog in the parks. Things like the entire NextGen initiative to Made with Magic/Glow with the Show to Genie and more. There are countless examples of abandoned technology that the company invested big bucks into, seemingly failing to take into account whether it was something guests would actually embrace. Vaughn and Kalama were just two of the Imagineers who covered this and adjacent topics as part of the new ‘Inside Imagineering Research & Development’ episode of the “We Call it Imagineering” YouTube series. During that, Disney shared an inside look at its once-secret internal R&D arm, while also highlighting prolific partnerships with tech companies including Nvidia, Google, and Meta. I want to start by saying that I’ve enjoyed every episode of “We Call It Imagineering,” but the ‘Inside Imagineering Research & Development’ episode is the first one that really felt like it was aimed at two distinct audiences. There’s the fans, obviously, and we no doubt ate up this behind-the-scenes look at what Disney is doing with robotics. At the same time, a lot of this seemed to be aimed squarely at investors, as a part of Disney’s years-long quest to be viewed (and valued) as a technology company. Heck, they even got Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to say, “at the core, Disney is a technology company.” Wall Street’s favorite CEO said the thing! That’s gotta be worth at least a 2% boost to Disney’s share price!!! In all seriousness, I can’t imagine there are many (any?) diehard Disney fans who were on the edges of their seats waiting to hear Jensen Huang’s take on Imagineering. If you gave me 10,000 guesses as to who would be featured in this episode, I wouldn’t have picked him. And yet, from Disney’s perspective–since it’s serving multiple audiences with content like this–that was probably the most consequential portion of the episode. (One of my favorite writers, Matt Levine of Bloomberg, routinely writes about the circularity of AI deals. Those sometimes involve partnerships with Nvidia and the promise to purchase their chips. That’s not the nature of the Disney-Nvidia relationship, but it’s close enough that this video reminded me of it. Point being, AI is definitely not a bubble. Nothing to see here, folks, just some totally normal pumping of stock prices.) The Meta x Ray-Ban smart glasses feel similarly. That this has been deemed a marquee corporate alliance for the Walt Disney Company (because Meta is a big deal), so they’re supposed to throw resources at it and tout it whenever possible. Honestly, I wouldn’t be the least bit surprised if Meta is underwriting all of the research & development that Disney is doing, and whatever the consumer product ends up being. There’s a tremendous amount of value to Meta in having trusted brands lend their goodwill to this product and normalize it, as Meta isn’t exactly a beloved American institution and this product isn’t something anyone asked for. So it’s going to take time and effort to reach a critical mass. If this is sounding familiar already, it’s because there’s overlap between the Meta x Ray-Ban smart glasses and Apple Vision Pro, which we discussed a couple of years ago when Disney announced a creative partnership for that product. I expressed skepticism at the time, just as I had done previously with Disney’s forays into the metaverse, Cinderella Castle Mural of Memories NFT, Prime-Style Membership Program, AI Task Force, and so on and so forth. What I wrote about Apple Vision Pro more or less applies to the Meta x Ray-Ban smart glasses. And I’ll be honest, I am openly hoping for both to fail so spectacularly that tech companies don’t try this nonsense again for another decade or two. For all of its promise and potential to bring us together, technology has done as much or more to isolate us. We walk around all day with our faces buried in screens; rather than chatting with strangers in face-to-face settings, we pick up our phones the moment there’s a brief lull in conversation. Our fixation with the virtual world has stressed the social fabric, and we are collectively worse for it–even as some aspects of our lives have unquestionably improved thanks to technology. Smart glasses obviously are less obtrusive than clunky Apple Vision Pro headsets. They nevertheless will isolate people from one another in public spaces if widely adopted and used in day-to-day life. If products like this become socially acceptable to wear and interact with in public, we will lose more of the small but meaningful interactions that make us human. That might sound hyperbolic, but the concerns are well-founded. This is precisely what the documentary “Her” was talking about. Disney and Meta can pretend that the future is a world where we’re freed from our screens and talking to an AI copilot as we interact with our family and friends, all while quickly learning about the world around us. Maybe they’re right! Perhaps that’s how it’ll happen. In my view, the more likely outcome is that this isolates people even further. That instead of talking to one another, striking up a conversation with fellow guests or asking questions of Cast Members, everyone retreats to their AI assistants to interact with. That we become less social with actual humans, siloing ourselves off because our agreeable AI companions are easier to talk to. Again, this might sound like doom and gloom. But does anyone actually think that social media made us more sociable? Or that any emerging technology in the last couple of decades has made us less, not more, addicted to devices? Do you truly believe that Meta wants you to spend less time using its products and more time immersed in reality? These trend lines are only going in one direction–at least, if the companies behind them have their ways. They can say otherwise, but they don’t exactly have strong track records with the truth. However, that comes with a very big “if.” Smart glasses are more likely to become socially acceptable to wear in public spaces than Apple Vision Pro (at least with its currently form factor). There’s no doubt about that. But that’s only because most people don’t realize you’re wearing them. I would imagine that it’d be a different story entirely if you got into a crowded queue and started asking questions to your sunglasses. As other guests start looking at you like you’re a crazy person, go ahead and try explaining that you’re talking to your “smart” sunglasses. See how well that goes over. Obviously, I don’t speak for the park-going public, but if I had such an interaction, I would move away from the person in question. Mostly because I don’t want to be in their field of view being watched over by Mark Zuckerberg. But partly because I have certain preconceived notions about someone who would carry on a conversation with their sunglasses. Maybe I’m alone in this, but I doubt it. If you already have these sunglasses and love them, more power to you. Perhaps you’re seeing the world in a new way; it’s worth acknowledging that the reverse might also be true. A decade ago, Google Glass learned precisely that lesson–that this kind of wearable was simply a bridge too far for average Americans. Google Glass was a spectacular failure, and the people who wore that nascent version of this tech were viewed as creeps and weirdos. But Meta and Ray-Ban are more mainstream, and perhaps partners like Disney will further normalize this type of wearable. Or maybe tech evangelists in Silicon Valley are truly disconnected from the rest of human civilization, unable to see beyond their own bubbles where products like this capture the imagination and are deemed the future of humanity. The majority of average Americans are weirded out by this type of thing, do not view it as the logical evolution of the smart device, and will never adopt it. While I don’t think there’s any putting the genie back in the bottle when it comes to the ubiquitousness of technology in society–nor should there be, as there are tangible benefits–I do think that people are becoming, and will continue to become, more cognizant of the dangers of living online and benefits of disconnecting. This is already happening. The first generation of kids exposed to social media and phones at young ages are now parents ourselves, and we’ve seen this firsthand. Phone-free schools are already increasingly common, but there’s a growing push to make schools screen-free entirely. And at least in our circle, most parents significantly limit screen time, or don’t allow it at all. This may seem beside the point, or to reinforce the desire for something like smart glasses, but it’s really not. The underlying sentiment is a skepticism about these tech companies and the addictiveness of their products. If you have any doubt about this, consider researching how tech executives restrict their own children’s use of these devices–or common policies around Silicon Valley school districts. It’s not just Millennial parents, the same trends are happening among younger people. Gen Z is more technologically literate than older generations, and they have a clearer view of these products and companies like Meta. And there’s certainly no reason to believe that older generations will be the early adopters of things like smart glasses, giving them the necessary market penetration. So who, exactly, is this for? What’s the path to it becoming as popular as the iPod or iPhone? It’s my fairly strong belief that there isn’t one. That the Meta x Ray-Ban smart glasses will be the best-selling version of this product, but that it won’t have even 1% of the market penetration as the smart phone. And from that perspective alone, this is DOA as being the future of the theme park experience. This cannot be what ‘breaks the spell’ (I realize I’m using this differently than Vaughn, but I found his turn of phrase apt–albeit in a different direction) of guests being glued to their phones, as not enough guests will use it for it to make a meaningful difference. It’s like the notion that Star Wars Galactic Starcruiser, Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge Datapad, Play Disney Parks, or any other past efforts at creating virtual worlds within the physical confines of Walt Disney World were the future of theme parks. An impossibility based on scale alone. Even with more charitable assumptions than I’m willing to make, it’s highly unlikely that there will ever be enough uptake for something like this to be what resolves the problem of excessive screen time. Perhaps Disney has been paid enough ZuckBucks and such a Walt Disney World application for the Meta x Ray-Ban smart glasses will come to fruition, but it’ll only work for fewer than 5% of guests. And probably the ones least inclined to be on their phones less. Ultimately, I’m heartened that Imagineering President Bruce Vaughn recognizes that excessive screen time is a problem with the guest experience, and something that actively undercuts what his division creates. At the same time, I’m also unconvinced that he has any realistic solutions to address this, or that the powers that be view this as a bug as opposed to a feature. Given that, the most likely outcome is more technology as opposed to less, and the hope that some of that will somehow be a net positive for the parks…and humanity. I don’t like our odds.

Blaming Disney for low grade guest behavior with phones? You e GziT to be kidding. This type of “glued to the screen” abhorrent behavior is everywhere Disney did not invent it. If Disney didn’t have mobile apps for food service, mobile check-out and other services you’d bitch about that and say they aren’t keeping up with the times. Low class guest behavior is a people problem that will be difficult to improve. Some people just have no manners or class hahahahahaha the documentary her Didn’t Disney JUST get rid of the glasses on Remy’s Ratatouille Adventure? And now they think people will want to use different glasses? Outside? Really? I suppose this could become an alternative to 3D glasses on Flight of Passage or Toy Story Mania…but that’s about it. Mom tells me to turn the phone on whenever I go out running errands or to a local restaurant (so she can contact me), but I always keep it off when I go to the theme parks. I boycott Lightning Lane because I think it’s an example of Disney greed & they should’ve stuck with free FastPasses. I’m not very technologically adept anyway & can’t even get my phone’s screen to cooperate with me to successfully type in a password when it keeps randomly switching between the letter, number, & symbol keyboards. Maybe if I could actually use a SmartPhone for more than calling home if I’m going to be late, I would be on the phone more often at the parks. But I’m glad I still enjoy being in the minute when I’m there. I rarely carried an old-fashioned camera with me for the same reasons. Labeling “Her” a documentary is the kind of thing that keeps me coming back, Tom. Your email address will not be published.

As one of Insider Reviews' lead computer experts, I keep a close eye on the laptop market to pick out the best savings. And I've already found sales on fantastic Windows, Mac, and Chromebook laptops. There are a lot of savings to browse, but some of my favorites include nearly $100 off the already-affordable Acer Aspire Go, $200 off the powerful 2025 MacBook Pro M5, and 25% off the 13-inch MacBook Air. You have a lot more options in addition to these, ranging from travel-friendly Chromebooks to RGB gaming rigs. Keep an eye on this article for updated Black Friday laptop deals as they come in, and head to our roundup of Black Friday coverage to see all of the top discounts our team finds throughout the event. There are more Windows laptops on the market than any other kind of laptop. This means that you've got a lot of choices, and it's not hard to find great deals. I'm seeing discounts on laptops across the price spectrum, ranging from high-end gaming models to budget beasts. The Acer Inspire Go is a solid option for users on a budget. Its display is decent with reasonably fast performance for a low price. The Acer Swift Go 14 AI is a thin laptop with a bright screen, fast processor, and unbelievably long battery life. Its power and longevity make it great for students and workers who need a laptop they can take on the go. MacBooks were once infamous for their high prices. However, in the modern day, MacBooks aren't actually any more expensive than PC laptops with the same hardware; PC laptop prices have increased, while MacBook prices have remained relatively stable. And on Black Friday, these premium laptops become even more affordable than usual. The newest MacBook Air models feature an M4 chip, which is one of the most powerful ever included in an Apple computer. Its speed, combined with a sleek design and beautiful screen, makes it a top-tier laptop. This larger 15-inch version of the 2025 MacBook Air uses Apple's M4 processor. It is available in 16GB or 24GB memory configurations with up to 512GB of storage. With all the "Mac vs. PC" hubbub, it's easy to forget about the third major player in the laptop market: Chromebooks. They're not as customizable or versatile as other laptops, but they do win in one department: Affordability. If all you need in a laptop is the ability to browse the web, check your email, watch YouTube, and maybe edit some photos, a Chromebook could be a better choice than an expensive Mac or PC — especially on Black Friday, when those affordable prices drop even lower. Chromebooks are solid options for buyers on a budget, and this affordable model from HP has decent specs for casual users. This budget Chromebook offers more memory and storage than most models, along with a bigger keyboard. It's a very affordable option perfect for budget-minded students and workers. Rather than invest in a bulky and pricey traditional gaming PC, a good gaming laptop is a solid option for smooth performance and portability. They're still not necessarily cheap, but finding one on sale for Black Friday can save you hundreds that would be better spent on peripherals like a reliable headset or lightweight mouse. All three operating systems have their pros and cons. But the large majority of buyers should stick with a Windows or Mac laptop. Windows laptops are remarkably versatile, capable of running more programs, playing more games, and opening a wider range of file types than any other operating system. They're also infinitely more customizable on both the hardware and software levels: Dozens of new PC laptops come out every year, and Windows offers loads of internal settings you can use to manage your computing experience. It's the operating system of choice if you want to have the most control over your laptop. MacBooks, meanwhile, place a greater emphasis on ensuring your computing experience is as smooth as possible. There aren't many settings you can edit, you'll install most programs through a streamlined app store, and viruses are nearly non-existent. It doesn't support as many programs as Windows does, but most users won't encounter any issues with this. If you want a laptop that just works without requiring any effort on your part, consider a MacBook. I wouldn't recommend a Chromebook to anyone except the most minimalist of laptop users. Chromebooks are essentially designed for one thing: Letting you surf the web. Sure, they can run some media editing software and support Google Gemini, but other operating systems can do that better. If all you need from your laptop is a basic internet connection, a Chromebook might be the right choice. Different laptop models fluctuate in price over the year. But in general, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are the best times to buy laptops. This is because, like cars, laptop manufacturers tend to release new models each year. At the end of the year, retailers aim to clear out their stock to make room for the new models. This often leads to record-low prices. It's mostly branding. There's nothing a "gaming" laptop can't do that an everyday laptop can't, and that's mostly true the other way around, too. "Gaming" tends to be another word for "high-end." Gaming laptops typically feature brighter displays, more powerful graphics cards, and higher RAM capacities than laptops that lack the "gaming" branding. In exchange, though, they're usually more expensive and heavier. In short, a great gaming laptop is also a great everyday laptop. If you want the absolute best laptop money can buy, consider a gaming laptop, even if you've never touched a video game in your life. Shopping for more discounts today?

Several top AI chipmakers lost ground as a potential deal between two Big Tech giants underscored competitive pressures in the market. Meanwhile, shares of an electronics retailer moved higher after a strong quarterly report. Major U.S. equities indexes rose for the third straight session as investors grew increasingly optimistic that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates at its December meeting. The Dow rose 1.4%, the S&P 500 gained 0.9%, and the Nasdaq ended 0.7% higher. See here for more from Investopedia on Tuesday's market moves. Keysight Technologies (KEYS) shares jumped 10% to log Tuesday's top performance in the S&P 500, after the provider of electronic test and measurement solutions topped quarterly earnings estimates. The company's sales outlook came in ahead of expectations, boosted by strong demand from AI data centers. Keysight also announced a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program. Shares of companies exposed to the housing market extended their recent rise amid growing optimism about a cut in interest rates, which would lead to lower mortgage rates. Builders FirstSource (BLDR) stock surged close to 9% Tuesday, adding to solid gains posted by the residential construction materials supplier in the prior session. Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) reported better-than-expected same-store sales, revenue, and adjusted profit for the third quarter, and its shares powered over 5% higher. The company also raised its full-year outlook, pointing to consumer resilience as well as gains in the computer, tablet, and gaming categories as customers upgrade and replace older devices. Shares of chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) dropped about 4%, falling the most of any S&P 500 stock Tuesday, while Nvidia (NVDA) slipped nearly 3% following a report that Meta Platforms (META) is evaluating using AI chips from Google. Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) climbed close to 2% to finish at a fresh high. J.M. Smucker (SJM) stock lost 3.7% after the parent of its namesake fruit spreads, Jif peanut butter, and Folgers coffee released its fiscal second-quarter earnings report. Although sales for the period edged out forecasts and adjusted profit matched expectations, Smucker's full-year profit outlook disappointed. The company has raised its coffee prices as it navigates tariff pressures but said it would refrain from additional price hikes this winter after the U.S. excluded raw coffee from tariffs.

Title: Why the GenAI Infrastructure Boom May Break Historical Patterns

Subscribe Mihir Kshirsagar Comments Authored by Mihir Kshirsagar Observers invoke railroad, electricity, and telecom precedents when contextualizing the current generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) infrastructure boom—usually to debate whether or when we are heading for a crash. But these discussions miss an important pattern that held across all three prior cycles: when the bubbles burst, investors lost money but society gained lasting benefits. The infrastructure enabled productivity gains that monopolistic owners could not fully capture. Investors lost, but society won. GenAI threatens to break this pattern. Whether or not the bubble bursts as many anticipate, we may not get the historical consolation prize. There are two reasons to doubt that GenAI will follow this trend: First, as I discuss in my prior post, the chips powering today’s systems have short-asset lives compared to the decades-long life of infrastructure of past cycles. Companies are also actively pursuing software optimization techniques that could dramatically shrink hardware requirements. In either case, the infrastructure that is left behind after a correction is not likely to become a cheap commodity for future growth. Second, the current market is shaped by hyperscaler-led coalitions that enable surplus extraction at multiple layers. As I discuss below, the usage-based API pricing captures application value, information asymmetry enables direct competition with customers, and coalition structures subordinate model developers to infrastructure owners. If productivity gains materialize at scale, these rent extraction capabilities may enable hyperscalers to realize the revenues that justify infrastructure investment—something past infrastructure owners could not do. But whether through sustained profitability or post-bust consolidation, the structural conditions that enabled broad diffusion of benefits in past cycles are absent. Now, there are some countervailing considerations. The research and development supporting open-weight models might be a source for productivity gains to be spread more broadly, and could even serve as the “stranded assets” that enable future innovation if the bubble bursts. But the regulatory environment needs to support such initiatives. The railroad industry consolidated dramatically after the Panic of 1873. By the early 1900s, seven financial groups controlled two-thirds of the nation’s railroad mileage. J.P. Morgan’s syndicate reorganized bankrupt roads into the Southern Railway and consolidated eastern trunk lines. Edward Harriman controlled the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific systems. James J. Hill dominated northern routes through the Great Northern and Northern Pacific. This concentration raised serious antitrust concerns—the Sherman Act was passed in 1890 largely in response to railroad monopoly power. But even with consolidation, railroad owners still struggled to pay their debts because the infrastructure’s economic benefits were dispersed across the economy and did not flow back directly to the owners. Richard Hornbeck and Martin Rotemberg’s important work shows how at the aggregate level when economies have input distortions—misallocated labor, capital stuck in less productive uses, frictions in resource allocation—the railroad infrastructure can generate substantial economy-wide productivity gains. These gains persisted over decades regardless of which financial group controlled the local rail lines. Farmers in Iowa shipping grain to Chicago paid freight rates, but the productivity improvements from market access—crop specialization, mechanization investments justified by larger markets, fertilizer access—stayed with the agricultural sector. The infrastructure that enabled these gains had useful lives measured in decades. Railroad tracks laid in the 1880s remained economically viable into the 1920s and beyond. Rolling stock, locomotives, and terminal facilities similarly had useful lives of twenty to forty years. When railroads consolidated, the long-lived infrastructure continued enabling agricultural productivity gains. The consolidation was anticompetitive, but the economic benefits didn’t concentrate entirely with the infrastructure owners. Three structural constraints, beginning with the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, but only effectively imposed nearly two decades later, limited railroad owners from capturing the economic surplus generated by their investments. First, bound by common carrier obligations, railroads charged fixed rates for shipping based on weight and distance, not a share of crop value. The railroad recovered infrastructure costs plus a margin, but could not discriminate based on agricultural productivity. Second, railroads had no visibility into which farms were most productive, or which crops were most profitable beyond what could be inferred from shipping volumes. As a result, they could not observe and selectively advantage their own agricultural ventures. Third, railroads faced substantial barriers to entering agriculture; directly operating farms required different expertise, capital, and management than operating rail networks. Now, railroads did try to move upstream, but regulatory actions prevented them from extending their dominant position. Samuel Insull built a utility empire in the 1920s that collapsed spectacularly in 1932, taking over $2 billion in investor wealth with it (nearly $50 billion today). The subsequent restructuring produced regional utility monopolies—by the 1940s, electricity generation and distribution were recognized as natural monopolies requiring either public ownership or regulated private provision. This consolidation was problematic enough that Congress passed the Public Utility Holding Company Act in 1935 to break up remaining utility combinations. Despite the market correction, the generating plants and transmission infrastructure built in the 1920s and 1930s had useful lives of forty to fifty years. Even as utility ownership consolidated into regional monopolies, the long-lived infrastructure continued enabling manufacturing productivity gains that utilities sold electricity to but couldn’t capture surplus from. Cheap electricity transformed American manufacturing in ways the utilities could not fully capture. Paul David’s foundational work on the “dynamo problem” shows that electrification enabled factory reorganization—moving from centralized steam power with belt drives to distributed electric motors allowed flexible factory layouts, continuous-process manufacturing, and eventually assembly-line production. Manufacturing productivity gains from electrification were substantial and persistent, but utilities sold kilowatt-hours at regulated rates. They could not price discriminate based on which manufacturers were most innovative or extract ongoing surplus from manufacturing productivity improvements. The constraints preventing electric utilities from capturing the surplus paralleled railroads in important respects, and were also eventually imposed through regulation. Utilities charged volumetric rates for electricity consumed, not a share of manufacturing output. A factory paid based on kilowatt-hours used, whether it was producing innovative products or commodity goods. Regulation eventually standardized rate structures, limiting even the ability to price discriminate across customer classes. Utilities had minimal visibility into how electricity was being used productively—they knew aggregate consumption but couldn’t observe which production processes were most valuable. And while some utilities did integrate forward into consumer appliances to stimulate residential demand, this was primarily about increasing electricity consumption rather than controlling downstream markets. Utilities faced prohibitive barriers to entering manufacturing directly; operating generating plants and distribution networks required different capabilities than running factories. In more recent memory, the telecom bust following the dot-com crash was severe. Several competitive local exchange carriers went bankrupt between 2000 and 2003. WorldCom filed for the largest corporate bankruptcy of its time in 2002. The resulting consolidation was substantial—Level 3 Communications acquired multiple bankrupt competitors’ assets, Verizon absorbed MCI/WorldCom, AT&T was reconstituted through acquisitions. By the mid-2000s, broadband infrastructure was concentrated among a handful of major carriers. But the fiber deployed in the 1990s—much of it still in use today—enabled the internet economy to flourish. The economic productivity gains from internet access are well-documented: e-commerce, SaaS businesses, remote work, streaming services, cloud computing, and so on. The constraints limiting telecom value capture were similar to earlier cycles. Carriers primarily sold bandwidth based on monthly subscriptions or per-gigabyte charges, not revenue shares from application success. A startup building on fiber infrastructure paid the same rates as established businesses. Carriers had limited visibility into which applications were succeeding and could not easily observe application-layer innovation. And telecom providers faced substantial technical and regulatory barriers to competing at the application layer during the critical formation period. Network operators were not positioned to compete with e-commerce sites, SaaS platforms, or streaming services in the late 1990s through early 2010s when the web economy was taking shape. There were exceptions that tested these boundaries. AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner and Verizon’s forays into media ventures showed carriers trying vertical integration. And the important net neutrality debates centered on whether carriers could favor their own services or extract rents from application providers. Regardless, during the critical period when the web economy came into prominence, telecom companies were not vertically integrated and therefore their infrastructure was available on more horizontal terms. The pattern across all three historical cases is consistent. Infrastructure consolidation happened and proved sticky, raising legitimate competition concerns. But structural constraints meant even monopolistic infrastructure owners could not fully capture application-layer surplus. They charged for access to infrastructure—shipping, kilowatt-hours, bandwidth—but the productivity gains from using that infrastructure diffused broadly through the economy. The long useful lives of the infrastructure meant these spillovers persisted for decades, even as ownership consolidated. As I’ve discussed here previously, the chips powering today’s AI systems have useful lives of one to three years due to rapid technological obsolescence and physical wear from high-utilization AI workloads. This short useful life means that even if AI infrastructure spending produces excess capacity, that capacity will not be available for new entrants to acquire and leverage effectively. In railroads, electricity, and telecom, stranded assets with decades of remaining useful life became resources that others could access. Three-year-old GPUs do not provide a competitive foundation when incumbent coalitions are running current-generation hardware. Put differently, in a hypothetical 2027 GenAI bust, an over-leveraged data center stocked with 2-year-old H100s will be comparatively worthless. That compute cannot be bought for pennies on the dollar to fuel new competition. The only entities that can survive are those hyperscalers with the massive, continuous free cash flow to stay on the “GPU treadmill”—namely, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta. (Dramatic increases in software efficiency could break this hardware moat, but the hyperscalers control over distribution channels is difficult to overcome.) The combination is what changes the outcome: vertical integration that enables surplus extraction, information position that enables direct competition, coalition structure that subordinates model developers to infrastructure owners, and short asset life that prevents the emergence of reusable infrastructure that others can access. The GenAI infrastructure buildout is producing market concentration through coalition structures: Microsoft-OpenAI, Amazon-Anthropic, Google-DeepMind. These are not loose partnerships—they are deeply integrated arrangements where the hyperscaler’s infrastructure economics directly enable their coalition’s competitive positioning at the application layer. Microsoft has invested billions in OpenAI and provides exclusive Azure infrastructure. Amazon is heavily invested in Anthropic. Google acquired DeepMind and is developing Gemini models that are integrated across Google Workspace and Cloud. This vertical integration attacks all three constraints that limited value capture in past cycles. First, usage-based GenAI pricing captures application-layer surplus through uncapped rates. Historically, railroads also charged based on usage—more cargo meant higher bills—but eventually regulators imposed the requirement to charge “reasonable and just” rates. Similarly, electric utilities charge per kilowatt-hour but face state commission oversight that caps rates at cost-plus-reasonable-return. These regulatory firewalls prevented infrastructure providers with natural monopoly characteristics from extracting surplus beyond what regulators deemed justified by their costs. While GenAI providers charge uniform per-token rates, they do have common carrier obligations. Moreover, while enterprise pricing remains opaque, the structure of published rates suggests that costs scale in close proportion to usage. This pricing structure, unconstrained by rate regulation or transparent volume pricing, allows concentrated infrastructure providers to capture ongoing application-layer surplus as successful applications scale. This capability has implications beyond just who benefits. In past cycles, infrastructure owners couldn’t capture application-layer surplus, which meant projected revenues never materialized and bubbles burst. If GenAI’s rent extraction model works, it changes the financial calculus and hyperscalers may actually generate sufficient revenues to cover their capital expenditures. But this “success” would come at the cost of concentrating gains rather than diffusing them broadly. Second, API usage patterns reveal application-layer innovation. Railroads could not easily observe crop profitability, utilities could not see manufacturing processes, and telecom providers in the 1990s-2000s could not easily monitor which web applications were succeeding. Hyperscalers can see which applications are working through API call patterns, token usage, and query types. This information asymmetry could allow them to identify promising use cases and compete directly. For example, Microsoft can observe what enterprises build with OpenAI. Or Google can see which applications gain traction on Gemini. The infrastructure position provides comprehensive competitive intelligence about the application layer. Third, hyperscalers are positioned to compete at the application layer. Railroads did not enter farming, utilities did not run factories, and while some telecom providers in the 1990s tried to compete with web startups by using “walled gardens” that strategy failed. By contrast, hyperscalers are already application-layer competitors. Microsoft competes in enterprise software. Google competes in productivity tools through Workspace. They can leverage GenAI capabilities to enhance existing products while simultaneously selling API access to would-be competitors. The integration runs both directions—infrastructure enables their own applications while extracting value from others’ applications. Indeed, in the software industry there is a long history of platforms cannibalizing or “sherlocking” the applications they enable. Moreover, this dynamic differs fundamentally from how cloud services were used in the last decade. When Netflix or Uber ran on AWS, they used the cloud as a commodity utility to host their own proprietary code and business logic. Amazon provided the servers, but it was not the “brain” of the application. In the GenAI stack the application logic—the reasoning, the content generation, the analysis—resides within the infrastructure provider’s model, not the customer’s code. This shifts the relationship from hosting a business to “renting cognition,” allowing the infrastructure owner to capture a significantly higher share of the value creation. The coalition structure reinforces vertical control. OpenAI is the public face of AI innovation but is structurally dependent on Microsoft’s infrastructure. Anthropic operates primarily on AWS and is tied to Amazon’s ecosystem. Even the most prominent model developers lack true independence—they’re subordinate partners in coalitions where the hyperscaler captures value through multiple channels while retaining the option to marginalize or compete with the model developer if advantageous. In past infrastructure cycles, the implicit social bargain was clear: while investors lost, society gained. Railroad, electricity, and telecom markets all concentrated substantially after their corrections, but the infrastructure continued enabling broad economic gains that owners could not fully capture. GenAI breaks this pattern. Whether through sustained profitability (enabled by rent extraction) or through post-bust consolidation (without reusable stranded assets), we may not get the historical consolation prize. The primary counter-narrative rests with the open-weight ecosystem. A robust, competitive landscape of open models could directly challenge the structural constraints that enable surplus extraction. This open-model path, therefore, represents a critical mechanism for realizing the broad, decentralized “spillover” benefits that characterized past infrastructure cycles. Thus, supporting this ecosystem, whether through public access to compute or pro-competitive interoperability rules, should be a strategic imperative for ensuring that the productivity gains from AI diffuse broadly rather than concentrating within the hyperscaler coalitions.

Title: 5 reasons Google is having a moment

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Google is on a tear right now — but its success in the AI race wasn't always guaranteed. In late 2022, OpenAI captured the moment with the release of ChatGPT. After a number of fumbles as Google struggled to get its own chatbot out the door, some of the closest Google watchers were calling for CEO Sundar Pichai to step down. Nearly three years later, Google has performed a miraculous turnaround. Its new AI model, Gemini 3, is proving such a win that Marc Benioff said he's switching from ChatGPT. Google has just surpassed Microsoft's market cap and is on its way to a $4 trillion status. Its stock price is up nearly 70% this year. It's a signal that Google — which has always held the various pieces to compete — has finally got everything working in harmony, all the way from the models up to the platforms like Search that put them in users' hands. In the fast-moving AI race, no victory is secure — but Google has never looked stronger. Here's why. Gemini 3 rolled out to the public last week with rave reviews. It outperforms its predecessor in coding, design, and analysis, and surpasses competing models in benchmark tests. As we at Business Insider discovered, it's highly adept at designing websites and basic video games, giving it broader use beyond coding. The new model has allayed some fears that Google was too far behind rivals and that scaling laws — rules that say AI models improve with more data and compute — were slowing down. The company's stock price has increased by more than 12% since the rollout of Gemini 3 on November 18. Google has spent over a decade developing its own chips for internal use. Known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Google has used these chips to train its Gemini models. That's a great advertisement as Google hopes more companies will adopt the chips for their own models. Google sells access to its TPUs through its cloud business and has made a significant internal push in recent months to attract more customers. That could pose a long-term threat to Nvidia's business. Google is currently in discussions for a blockbuster deal with Meta worth billions of dollars, which would potentially host some of Google's chips in one of Meta's own data centers, according to a person familiar with the discussions. The Information first reported on the arrangement, which sent the shares of chip companies like AMD and Nvidia tumbling on Tuesday. In September, a federal judge handed down penalties for an antitrust lawsuit brought against Google's search business in 2020. Those penalties, which threatened to tear up Google's lucrative search empire, amounted to little more than a slap on the wrist. Google was told it could continue making payments to partners such as Apple for default status, but could not do so exclusively. It was also ordered to share some search data with rivals. At one point, Google's Chrome browser was on the chopping block, which could have severed a crucial part of Google's search-advertising flywheel. Despite the judge ruling that Google had acted as a monopoly, the company came away relatively unscathed. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway built a $4.3 billion stake in Google parent company Alphabet last quarter, a regulatory filing revealed. That's notable for two reasons. Other than Apple, Buffett has tended to avoid tech stocks. He has also historically avoided expensive, high-growth companies. As Buffett prepares to step back as CEO, the decision to finally bet on Google — something he said he wished he'd done long ago — suggests strong confidence in the search giant. Google's core moneymaker is still search advertising, and one of the big investor fears has been how Google's self-disruption might hurt its cash cow. Not a lot, apparently: Search revenues jumped 15% in the third quarter, suggesting that even if AI is hurting some websites' traffic, it's not harming Google's business. In fact, Google says generative AI is causing people to search more than ever. The company is currently testing ads in AI Mode, its chatbot-like version of search that is gradually feeling like less of an experiment and more like Google's vision for how search will eventually work.

Title: The Reset: Your Hollywood Guide to an AI Bubble Burst

Pro Available to WrapPRO members Who’s most exposed when the AI rally finally comes to an end? What you’re missing: The Reset is a newsletter we send out every Sunday to the corporate enterprise subscribers to WrapPRO. If you think your company or organization would be interested in signing up for an enterprise plan, please reach out to our head of enterprise sales, Kimberly Donnan, at kimberly.donnan@thewrap.com. Happy Sunday, Part of any daily dialogue these days seems to include the argument over whether we are in an AI bubble. The sentiment changes almost hourly while the camp of of not if but when is picking up momentum. But it’s a rollercoaster. SoftBank selling its nearly $6 billion stake in Nvidia fueled bubble theories, but Nvidia’s knockout quarter reported on Wednesday seemed to shut those down — for now. The analysts’ estimates vary widely projecting that from 40% to as much as 75% of the stock market’s gains this year are attributable to AI-related equities. Either way, it’s substantial. This chart from Bank of America Global Research highlights the ongoing concerns of fund managers through a new November survey. Hollywood and the larger media sector have had a love-hate relationship with AI so far, which begs the question that if we are indeed in a bubble and that bubble bursts, how bad will it hurt business? Here’s a few thoughts on those with the most exposure: Netflix — A robust early adopter of AI for content personalization, dubbing, localizing programming, and automated trailer production has high exposure. Those tools depend on early-stage AI vendors that would get crushed if a bubble burst. Bottom line is that localization efforts, key to building sub growth outside U.S., would get more expensive. Disney — With its internal efforts at integrating AI stalling, Disney is increasingly looking at partners to help with production and VFX. It’s also beginning to use AI-driven personalization and robotics at its parks. A bubble burst would mean fewer outside options to fully take advantage of the capabilities of AI. Warner Bros. Discovery — AI isn’t much of a presence at WBD beyond the promise of the technology cutting costs from everything to marketing to production. WBD is pitching as positive a narrative as it can to Wall Street right now as it shops itself. The bubble bursting would kill that narrative, but presumably CEO David Zaslav would have sold the company already. Sony — Sony Animation and Crunchyroll are testing AI-dependent localization and subtitling pipelines. Its gigantic gaming division is experimenting with AI in the creative process, especially at the intersection of film and TV IP. What’s more, VFX shops, like Framestore, Weta FX and DNEG, are getting help from AI on so-called rotoscoping, upscaling and simulation. Same story: This kind of help comes from startups that would be wiped out in a bubble burst. It’s worth considering, too, the growing divergence between AI stocks and consumer sentiment, as the Wall Street Journal’s Greg Ip pointed out last week, highlighted by this chart. The so-called Magnificent Seven include Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Tesla. Stepping back, an AI bubble burst would not kill innovation in Hollywood, to be clear. But it will be a setback and likely force the delay of any planned technology rollouts. One upside, I guess, is that a bubble burst might take some of the tension out of labor relations that have been rocky since AI arrived on the scene. Enjoy your Thanksgiving and see you back here next Sunday. Tom LowrySenior Vice President/Editorial Strategytom.lowry@thewrap.com 1. U.S. Political Divide Revealed on Social A recent survey from Statista Consumer Insights reflects pretty much the U.S. political divide on an even basis. Some light differences do show up in the survey conducted between October 2024 and this past September; Facebook is where centrists feel most at home. X is where partisanship is most visible, with more users leaning right. No surprises there. LinkedIn also leans more right with its more business-focused user base. Reddit is the one platform of those included in the survey that leans left. BlueSky, which was created at a time when Elon Musk took control of the old Twitter, was not included in the survey. 2. Streaming’s Sticker Shock We all feel the weight of subscriptions we are carrying but this chart fromLeverage Shares brings it all home. It shows the price changes for the most popular streaming services since 2019, with Disney+ topping the list at 172% inflation, a factor that probably made it easier for subscribers to drop the service over parent company’s decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel. The inflation gives you pause to remember that streaming was created, in part, to be the low-cost alternative to traditional pay platforms like cable and satellite. But content is expensive and growth slows, and streamers feel like they’ve got the pricing power. But for how long? The work of determining the fate of Warner Bros. Discovery begins in earnest now. With bids submitted at Thursday’s deadline, let the due diligence begin. CEO David Zaslav will no doubt be leaning heavily on a team of advisors, no one more so than Paul Gould, the veteran investment banker with Allen & Co., one of the firms WBD hired to navigate a potential sale or split of the company. Allen & Co. has been advising media companies for more than half a century and Gould has been part of the team there since 1972. He is also an independent director on the WBD board, and has a long history of working with one of the company’s largest individual shareholders, billionaire cable mogul John Malone. The boutique investment bank is probably best-known for hosting its annual gathering of media, entertainment and tech executives every July in Sun Valley, Idaho. Gould is a fixture there. The confab has become known as the “billionaire’s summer camp.” But unlike the outsized personalities of the executives he serves, Gould is happy behind the scenes and famously press shy. In fact, the only photo we could find of him is the above picture from Sun Valley more than 10 years ago, walking alongside Malone. Gould has been an advisor on thousands of deals over the decades. Allen’s recent record includes the AT&T / Time Warner deal in 2016, advising Time Warner in its $108 billion acquisition by AT&T; advising Activision in 2022 in the nearly $70 billion acquisition by Microsoft; the firm advised on the 2015 separation of eBay and PayPal, a deal valued at $49.16 billion, the firm also brokered the Jeff Bezos’ 2013 acquisition of The Washington Post. The play for Warner Bros. Discovery is one of the biggest and most high-profile bidding wars in recent years for any company, not just in media. Zaslav will continue to be the public face of the unfolding drama. But you can’t underestimate the investment banker whose team is busy behind the scenes with an opinion or two about the potential buyer that will make the most sense.

Major U.S. equities indexes gained Tuesday afternoon, extending Monday's rally to start a holiday-shortened trading week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up over 1%, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.5%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq ticked 0.1% higher. Kohl's (KSS) saw its shares surge 35% after the department store chain reported a surprise third-quarter profit. The results came a day after the retailer said it would remove the "interim" tag from CEO Michael Bender's title to take over the top job permanently after its prior CEO lasted just months before being ousted over allegations of improper dealings with a vendor. Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) was another retailer that soared Tuesday, with shares up 30% after the company topped third-quarter earnings estimates. Sales growth has slowed among its namesake brand, but picked up for Hollister, which executives said is expected to carry the company's sales for the holiday season. Videoconference software maker Zoom Communications (ZM) also posted quarterly results that topped analysts' estimates, sending shares 12% higher. The company said it is seeing meaningful adoption of its AI offerings. Nvidia (NVDA) shares sank close to 4%, making the stock one of the biggest decliners in the S&P 500 Tuesday following a report that Meta Platforms (META) is considering using chips from Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL). Shares of Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and other chipmakers also slid. Coinbase (COIN) stock was one of several connected to the cryptocurrency sector, along with Robinhood (HOOD), Mara Holdings (MARA), and Strategy (MSTR), that extended their recent declines as the price of Bitcoin lost ground, trading around $87,200. The price of gold rose, and crude oil futures slid. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note edged lower to 4.00%. The U.S. dollar lost ground against the pound, yen, and euro.

Title: Amazon's $50 billion plan - AWS to boost AI, supercomputing for US government agencies — What we know

US-based technology giant Amazon announced its plans to invest up to $50 billion into the expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) and supercomputing capabilities for the US government agencies through its Amazon Web Services (AWS), according to an official announcement. Amazon's investment in the expansion is aimed at improving the discovery and decision-making ability of the government agencies as they integrate their simulation and modeling data with AI, autonomous experimental steering and real-time feedback loops. “Our investment in purpose-built government AI and cloud infrastructure will fundamentally transform how federal agencies leverage supercomputing,” said AWS CEO Matt Garman. “This investment removes the technology barriers that have held government back and further positions America to lead in the AI era.” Amazon Web Services' (AWS) up to $50 billion investment is set to add nearly 1.3 gigawatts of AI and supercomputing capacity across AWS Top Secret, AWS Secret, and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. The company will build data centres with advanced computing and networking technology power as part of its expansion efforts. According to the official announcement, the federal government agencies will gain expanded access to AWS's comprehensive AI services, including Amazon SageMaker AI, Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Nova, and Anthropic Claude, among other things. “These new capabilities will be available to existing and future U.S. government customers across AWS Top Secret, AWS Secret, and GovCloud (US) Regions, strengthening America's AI leadership and giving federal agencies the secure, scalable infrastructure they need for the next era of innovation,” the company said in its announcement. The investment will also contribute to critical US government and industrial base missions ranging from national security to scientific research and innovation, which includes autonomous systems development, cybersecurity, energy innovation, and healthcare research. According to a recent report from CNBC, Amazon's move comes after Meta and Anthropic's decision to expand AI data centres in the United States, and Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank's plan to invest $500 billion in the country's AI infrastructure. Amazon share price jumped more than 1% to $228.64 during the intraday trading session on Tuesday as of 11:53 a.m. (IST), compared to $226.28 at the previous US stock market session, according to the MarketWatch data. Shares of the tech and e-commerce giant have given more than 43% returns in the last five years, and over 14% returns in the last one-year period. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, Amazon shares are trading 4.39% higher in 2025. The shares of Amazon hit their 52-week high level at $258.60, while the 52-week low level stood at $161.38, according to the MarketWatch data. The company's market capitalisation (M-Cap) stood at $2.42 trillion as of the stock market session on Tuesday, 25 November 2025.

Title: Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Bet on This Big Tech Stock. Should You?
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/warren-buffett-s-berkshire-hathaway-bet-on-this-big-tech-stock-should-you-alphabet-goog-googl-11856004
Time Published: 2025-11-25T16:24:06Z
Full Content:
Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has placed a big bet on one of the tech’s hottest stocks. Berkshire (BRK.A)(BRK.B) purchased 17.8 million shares of Alphabet’s Class A stock (GOOGL) in the third quarter, according to a regulatory filing made public earlier this month. A stake of that size in the Google parent would be worth nearly $5.7 billion as of Monday's close. Alphabet is an unusual purchase for Berkshire, which tends to buy unloved stocks with the intention of holding them long term. Alphabet, meanwhile, is far from unloved. The stock soared more than 6% Monday after Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff praised its Gemini 3 AI model, saying he was “never going back” to using rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Later Monday, news reports—first published by The Information—indicated that it might sell AI chips to Meta Platforms (META), further strengthening investors' sense of the company's position. Alphabet shares added nearly 2% on Tuesday. Berkshire Hathaway is known for investing in companies with slow-and-steady businesses and, in the firm's opinion, undervalued stocks, making its Alphabet purchase a relatively unusual one. Not only is Alphabet a member of the Magnificent Seven—the high-flying set of tech stocks whose valuations have spooked investors of late—it’s also the best-performing member of the group by a long shot this year. Shares are up about 70%, more than double Nvidia's (NVDA) year-to-date return as of Tuesday's close. Alphabet isn’t the only Mag 7 stock in Berkshire’s portfolio. Apple (AAPL) is the conglomerate’s largest stock holding, worth about $65.7 billion. But it first bought Apple stock in 2016 and has been trimming that position for the past two years. Berkshire sold about 15% of its stake in the iPhone maker last quarter. Analysts are generally bullish on Alphabet stock. JPMorgan analysts raised their price target by 13% after the company reported better-than-expected third-quarter results late last month. The analysts called the report “strong across the board,” and noted Alphabet was showing “signs that AI search is more opportunity than threat,” contrary to Wall Street’s expectations. Analysts at Wedbush also raised their price target, and argued the quarter "validates Alphabet's position as a leading AI beneficiary.” Alphabet also raised its full-year capital expenditures guidance last month. It expects to invest more than $90 billion in capital equipment this year, with much of that going toward building data centers and filling them with chips to train and run AI models. Investors have recently grown wary of tech's AI spending, with some wondering when they'll see a return on their investments, if at all. Regardless, 12 of the 15 analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha rate shares a “buy,” and the remainder recommend holding the stock. Their average price target of $324 is right about where the stock closed on Tuesday. UPDATE: This article has been updated to include the latest stock price information.

Title: Larry Page becomes second richest person in the world after Alphabet share rally — What's his net worth?

Google co-founder Larry Page is now the second-richest person in the world, just after Tesla CEO Elon Musk. thanks to a bumper and ongoing rally in Alphabet stocks. Larry Page on Monday dethroned Oracle's Larry Ellison to snatch the position, according to the Forbes Real Time Billionaires List. Shares of Alphabet climbed 6.31% on Monday at close after a report said Facebook-parent Meta Platforms was in discussions to use Google's AI chips in its data centers from 2027 and rent chips from Google Cloud by next year. Alphabet stock price today continued its rally to touch an all-time high at premarket trading on Tuesday, rising over 3%. As per Forbes Real Time Billionaires list, the net worth of Larry Page stood at $267.5 billion on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Larry Ellison of Oracle slipped to the No.3 position with a net worth of $250.5 billion. Elon Musk remained the wealthiest person in the world, with his net worth hitting a massive $473.2 billion. On Monday alone, Larry Page's net worth climbed by $8.7 billion as per Forbes, thanks to the rally in Alphabet shares. The rally in Page's personal wealth over the past five years is impressive too, going from $50.9 billion in 2020 to $144 billion at the beginning of 2025. By the years end, he touched the quarter-trillion dollar mark. Larry Page is the co-founder of Google, one of the world's most recognised and valuable companies. Page founded the company with Stanford PhD student Sergey Brin in 1998, and used to be the CEO of Alphabet — the parent company of Google. Larry Page vacated the CEO office in 2019 but continued to remain a stakeholder at the company, which explains the meteoric surge in his wealth. At Google, he was the CEO till 2001. Shares of Google parent Alphabet have rallied almost 70% this year, outperforming other megacaps and bringing it close to the prized $4 trillion market capitalisation. Alphabet climbed 3.7% in premarket trading, bringing the search giant closer to a $4 trillion valuation. The rally came after the Information reported that Meta Platforms Inc. is in talks to spend billions of dollars on the search giant’s artificial intelligence chips. Meta is in discussions to use the chips — known as tensor processing units, or TPUs — in data centers in 2027, according to the Information, which cited an unidentified person familiar with the talks. Meta also may rent chips from Google’s cloud division next year, the news outlet said. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: Nvidia Shares Fall Sharply Amid Talks Of Meta Mulling Use Of Google Chips
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/nvidia-share-price-movement-amid-talks-of-meta-mulling-use-of-google-chips
Time Published: 2025-11-25T15:07:42Z
Full Content:
Shares of Nvidia Corp. plunged nearly 7% during early trade on Tuesday following reports that Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. is considering using chips designed by Google. The slide put the stock on track for its biggest monthly decline since the market rout of 2022. The share price has fallen about 15% month to date. Google-parent Alphabet Inc. gained as much as 2.6% higher, after a more than 6% rally on Monday. The Information reported that Meta is considering using Google's tensor processing units (TPUs) in its data centers in 2027. Meta may also rent TPUs from Google's cloud unit next year, the publication reported. Google launched its first-generation TPU in 2018 and it was initially designed for its own internal use for its cloud computing business. Since then, Google has launched more advanced versions of its chip that are designed to handle artificial intelligence workloads. The company released its 7th generation TPU, Ironwood, this month. A Google-Meta deal would help establish TPUs as an alternative to Nvidia's chips, the gold standard for big tech firms and startups from Meta to OpenAI that need computing power to develop and run artificial intelligence platforms. Graphics processing units (GPUs), dominated by Nvidia, were initially designed to accelerate graphics rendering, particularly for video games and visual effects. However, their ability to handle large data sets and computations made them ideal for training AI models. In contrast, TPUs are specialised microchips, known as application-specific integrated circuits, designed specifically for a particular purpose. Last month, Google signed a deal with Anthropic PBC to supply up to 1 million of its specialised AI chips in a deal worth tens of billions of dollars. Meta's capex of at least $100 billion for 2026 suggests it will spend at least $40-$50 billion on inferencing-chip capacity next year, as per a Bloomberg report.
