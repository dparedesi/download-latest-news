April 28, 2025 14:42 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP APP Investors with Losses Encouraged to Contact the Firm Before May 5th Deadline SAN FRANCISCO, April 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads. Following the release of these reports, the price of AppLovin shares reportedly fell by more than 12%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the claims. “The allegations detailed in the short reports and outlined in the recently filed class action complaint, detailing the purported exploitation of user data and manipulative installation schemes, raise serious questions about the integrity of AppLovin's reported growth and the accuracy of its disclosures to the investing public,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: What’s The Vibe In The U.S. Tech Sector

ByJack Kelly ByJack Kelly, Senior Contributor. Female data scientist is using a digital tablet with graphical electronic circuit projection The U.S. tech sector is contending with a combination of innovation along with job instability. The vibe is resilient, but anxious. A U.S. News survey shows 80% of tech workers report job satisfaction. They cite high pay and impact, but posts on the X platform reveal growing pessimism, with 65% of tech workers surveyed by The Information expecting worse conditions, driven by layoffs and hiring pullbacks. Drawing on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Forbes, Layoffs.fyi, and executive search firm Robert Half, alongside sentiment from the vocal X platform, here’s a snapshot of the tech sector’s pulse. This includes the range of what’s happening in the job market to dream employers and the daily grind. The BLS projects 356,700 annual tech job openings through 2033, signaling growth, especially in AI and fintech, where financial services now attract 22% of Cornell’s computer science graduates, up from 16% in 2022. US tech professionals are drawn to companies like NVIDIA, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Salesforce, Adobe, and Netflix for their innovation, competitive pay, and supportive cultures. These employers offer the chance to work on transformative technologies, grow professionally, and enjoy flexible, inclusive workplaces. Tech workers rank companies like Oracle, Amazon, and FIS Global highly, per Forbes’ 2024 Best Employers for Tech Workers, based on about 25,000 surveyed employees. Oracle’s supportive culture and Amazon’s mentorship programs shine, offering competitive pay, $142,000–$210,000 along with generous bonuses, stock options, and growth. Robert Half’s 2025 Salary Guide notes only 41% of tech workers are satisfied with pay, averaging $112,521, though AI-skilled professionals earn a 17.7% premium. A Dice report highlights 47% of tech workers are actively seeking new roles, driven by underpayment or lack of flexibility. Layoffs make job searches tougher. Still, over 7 million job postings in 2025, a 33% jump, per Dice, show opportunities persist for skilled candidates. AI engineering roles are emerging as the top hiring priority. U.S. tech managers are hiring for AI engineer positions. This surge in AI-focused recruitment is complemented by a growing need for full-stack engineers, who play a crucial role in building AI systems. The most sought-after jobs include AI engineers, cloud architects, and cybersecurity analysts. AI engineers, leveraging Python and TensorFlow, earn $150,000–$300,000 plus bonuses and stock, per Glassdoor. Cloud architects average $148,821, and cybersecurity analysts, vital amid digital threats, earn $120,000–$200,000, according to Robert Half. Work-from-home policies are shrinking. Robert Half finds only 18% of 2025 tech roles are fully remote, clashing with 46% of workers unwilling to return onsite full-time. Hybrid models dominate, with companies offering commute perks to lure workers back, per Crunchbase. This shift frustrates many, as flexibility remains a top priority, per Harvey Nash’s 2024 report. Life as a tech worker is dynamic but demanding. Many juggle upskilling in AI or cloud computing, with 87% of hiring leaders valuing AI experience, per ResumeTemplates.com. Long hours, especially in startups, contrast with perks like mental wellness support at firms like CoreWeave. However, the BLS projects 356,700 annual tech job openings through 2033, driven by AI and fintech growth. Financial services now attract 22% of Cornell’s computer science graduates, up from 16% in 2022, reflecting shifting priorities toward fintech innovation. The tech industry, heavily reliant on global supply chains, faces significant challenges from the 2025 tariffs. Companies like Apple, Amazon, and NVIDIA, which depend on manufacturing in China, Vietnam, and Taiwan, are grappling with increased costs for imported hardware, semiconductors, and consumer electronics. The Consumer Technology Association projects that tariffs could reduce U.S. consumer purchasing power by $90–143 billion, with potential declines in laptop and tablet purchases by up to 68% and smartphones by 37%. This drop in demand threatens revenue for hardware giants and e-commerce platforms, as seen in stock price drops. Business woman working in an incredible futuristic and original office space, looking at her phone, ... More worried about layoffs The tech industry faced significant workforce reductions, with Layoffs.fyi reporting that 50,728 employees were let go across 111 tech companies. This wave of layoffs, while less intense than the peak of 2023, reflects ongoing adjustments within the sector as companies navigate economic shifts, technological advancements, and strategic realignments. Among the companies leading these layoffs, Intel stands out with its announcement to cut approximately 22,000 jobs, representing 20% of its workforce. This move, the largest tech layoff of the year, underscores the challenges faced by the semiconductor industry. Meta followed with a reduction of 3,600 workers, roughly 5% of its staff, framing the cuts as a push to enhance productivity and eliminate underperforming roles. STMicro, another player in the electronics and semiconductor space, laid off 3,000 employees, grappling with market headwinds. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) trimmed 2,500 jobs, about 5% of its workforce, after a 19% drop in its stock price in the first quarter of 2025. Workday, a software firm, reduced its headcount by 1,750, or 8.5%, to redirect resources toward artificial intelligence initiatives. Microsoft also contributed to the trend, eliminating 2,280 roles across divisions like cloud services and mixed reality as part of performance-driven restructuring. The rise of artificial intelligence and automation has reshaped priorities. Firms are channeling significant investments into AI development, automating tasks previously handled by human workers. This shift has rendered roles in areas like software engineering, human resources, and support teams redundant, as evidenced by cuts at Stack Overflow and Salesforce. Despite robust profits at some tech giants, high interest rates, inflation, and investor demands for leaner operations have pushed companies to prioritize cost-cutting. Meta and Microsoft, for instance, have used layoffs to bolster stock prices and strengthen their financial positions. Many firms are restructuring to focus on high-growth areas such as AI and cybersecurity, as seen in Cisco’s strategic pivot away from less profitable segments. A concerning dynamic is at play. Once one or two top tier tech companies announce layoffs, it follows up with a copycat effect where companies also start laying off people too.

Title: Fired FTC commissioners on fighting for their jobs back

Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Slaughter want to take their fight to the Supreme Court, and they think they can win. by Nilay Patel Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Slaughter want to take their fight to the Supreme Court, and they think they can win. by Nilay Patel Today, we have something special for you: A few days ago, I hosted a panel with FTC commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya at the IAPP Global Privacy Summit in Washington, DC. We recorded the discussion, and we’re bringing it to you today. That’s all pretty normal Decoder stuff, you might say — except these are anything but normal circumstances. Right off the bat, you’ll hear me even struggle to introduce them. Becca and Alvaro were FTC commissioners until very recently, when President Donald Trump fired them. The thing is, he doesn’t appear to have any legal authority to actually do that. As you’ll hear them discuss, by law the FTC needs to have commissioners from both political parties. Additionally, there’s a 90-year-old Supreme Court precedent that explicitly says the President can’t fire FTC commissioners in this way. So, given all that, they’re suing the administration to get their jobs back — and as you’ll hear, they are both committed to taking this case all the way to the Supreme Court. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! That puts them in a deeply weird, Schrödinger’s cat kind of position, for now: they both are and are not currently working as FTC commissioners, and that creates some strange tensions you’ll hear us get into. On top of all that, of course, there’s the actual work of the FTC going on. The antitrust trial against Meta was going on basically down the street from where I sat talking with Rebecca and Alvaro, so I spent some time asking how that case was going — and why Mark Zuckerberg’s donations to the inauguration and frequent appearances in the Oval Office haven’t seemed to dissuade the government from trying to break up Meta. You’ll hear Becca in particular point out that being bad at bribes still means the government is open for bribery and corruption, and that creates all kinds of other problems for the economy. There’s a lot going on in this conversation, from how the president fires you to the attempt in Silicon Valley to build AI into a digital god. We also somehow ended up taking printer recommendations from the audience. It’s a good one. Okay: liminal FTC commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Hi everybody. I am Nilay Patel. I’m the editor-in-chief of The Verge and host of the Decoder podcast. I have two excellent guests with me today. I’m going to say former Federal Trade Commission chairs. Alvaro Bedoya: That’s up to you. That’s your call. We would politely disagree. Rebecca Slaughter: We would not say that. Current liminal FTC commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya. Welcome, thank you for being here. RS: Thanks for having us. I have a million questions for the both of you. Let’s start with the elephant in the room. Normally, in a conversation about privacy and consumer protection with FTC commissioners, it would be a fairly predictable set of topics, especially now with AI. It is not a predictable time in America. It is not a predictable set of circumstances. Let’s start with your status with President Donald Trump. He fired both of you. It appears to be illegal. Tell us how that happened. Did he call you? RS: He did not call us. I’ll start by noting that Donald Trump originally appointed me in 2018 to the FTC. I was appointed as a minority commissioner, a Democrat. The agency is, by statute, composed of bipartisan members. The statute says: five members, no more than three from any one party. I was appointed in 2018 as a minority commissioner. I served as a minority commissioner, and then I was briefly the acting chair at the beginning of the Biden administration. Then, I was a majority commissioner, along with Commissioner Bedoya, who joined us in 2022, then became a minority commissioner again in January 2025. On March 18, which was a Tuesday, I had finished a day at the office, meeting with a bunch of staff in the agency. Then, I was at my kid’s elementary school volunteering on a drama club project. We always joke that we like to keep the drama on the stage and out of our house, but no, the drama found us that day. I checked my email and I had an email from someone I’d never heard of in the Presidential Personnel Office with a message purportedly on behalf of Donald Trump announcing that I was terminated effective immediately. I stood up and I walked out of drama club to the courtyard, and I called Alvaro and I said, “Hey, have you checked your email?” And you can take the story over from there. AB: I was very proudly not checking my email because I’d just arrived at my daughter’s gymnastics class, and she gets really annoyed when she does a cool trick and I’m looking at my phone like an idiot. So, I got a call and I picked it up and Becca said, “Have you seen your email?” And I said, “Actually, I haven’t seen my email.” And she said, “You should check your email because I just got an email purporting to fire me.” Sure enough, that same email was in my inbox right there. Okay, I have a number of tech reporter questions. Did you receive a plain text email saying you had been terminated? I’m just imagining Donald Trump creating a PDF. That’s in my head. RS: No, that did not happen. There was no PDF, there was no signed letter, there was no signature. It was a text email. AB: There was no indication that there was any additional level of security associated with email. I’m just curious about the mechanics of how these decisions are made. RS: It literally felt like somebody typed an email in their Outlook and hit send. Very good, very on-brand. You guys are both in litigation against the Trump administration and Chairman Andrew Ferguson. They are in what appears to be a violation of a 90-year-old Supreme Court case called Humphrey’s Executor v. United States. I don’t think a district court is going to overturn that precedent. Are you prepared to go all the way to the Supreme Court on this one? RS: Absolutely. This is not a complicated case. There’s no dispute about the facts and there’s no dispute about what the law says. The law says, very explicitly, that commissioners can only be removed for neglect, malfeasance, or inefficiency, so what we generally call cause. You’ve got to do something wrong. The email purporting to fire us did not allege any cause, and I feel like it’s important to say that there is no cause. Neither of us have engaged in neglect, malfeasance, or inefficiency. Alvaro is one of the hardest working people in not just Washington but the country, andI try to follow close behind him. There is no cause. The statute says we can only be removed for cause. That statute was passed 111 years ago and 92 years ago was the last time a president tried to remove an FTC commissioner. FDR tried to fire Commissioner William Humphrey also for no cause. He sued, challenging his removal, and then he died before the case was settled, which is why this famous case is called “Humphrey’s Executor.” His estate pursued the lawsuit, and it went all the way up to the Supreme Court. The unanimous Supreme Court said, “Yes, that statute says commissioners can only be removed for cause. And yes, that statute is constitutional.” That precedent has been undisturbed, unchanged, unchallenged… well, it’s been challenged but not effectively for 90 years. So yes, I would be shocked if a district court judge decided to unilaterally overturn 90 years of Supreme Court precedent. And yes, I think we are very prepared for this to be a case that is litigated up to the Supreme Court. Indeed, I think that’s what the administration is trying to do. They are unsubtly trying to challenge this 90-year-old precedent under the theory that the president should be able to fire whomever he wants. They argue that that is necessary for Democratic accountability. I find that argument a little ironic because I think what bipartisan commissions provide is accountability and transparency, even while allowing the president to execute his agenda by naming the chair and having the majority of the commission. There are lots of legal nuances, but it’s not a close case. There is the unitary executive theory. In many ways, the Supreme Court has pursued that theory over the course of all of their individual careers. It does feel like maybe they want to overturn another precedent. They’re on a spree of overturning, although I’m not sure I learned anything in law school. RS: Nothing we learned in law school remains relevant. It’s a fair point. Right. It’s gone. What is a tort? Let’s find out. It’s a real situation. Do you think you have a good chance with this court? AB: I think we do. RS: There’s more nuance there. AB: I think it is very important for people to realize that in a sense, this is about Commissioner Slaughter and I, and our continued service on the commission. In another arguably much more important sense, it is about a commission being able to serve without fear of favor, especially independent institutions like our own. And if the president can remove Commissioner Slaughter and I for no reason at any time, he can do the same to Jerome Powell at the Federal Reserve. He can do the same for commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission. He has done the same at the National Credit Union Administration. He could do the same at the FDIC. These are bedrock institutions of our financial life. So this is about privacy to a degree and about cybersecurity. But this is also about your retirement account, your checking account. Will those things that you hold quite dear be subject to the same stable regulatory and enforcement environment that is provided in a world where the leaders of these institutions are protected by for-cause removal productions? RS: I think it goes even further than that because these institutions also include the FCC, the SEC, the CFTC, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, and a whole panoply of institutions that have been built up over the last 100 years by Congress explicitly to be bipartisan. If they effectively challenge removal protections, then what meaning do the appointment requirements have? Then, can these institutions even continue to exist because they would be so divorced from what Congress designed and built. I think understanding that the stability point that Commissioner Bedoya is talking about goes beyond if you’re going to have wild swings in policy at these agencies from administration to administration. It goes much deeper into whether these agencies can even exist. Can markets rely on the stability that they provide?” Are you taking anything from the chaos around Trump threatening Powell and walking it back as the market reacted? RS: What we are seeing is exactly what we’ve been saying, which is that he thinks he can fire whomever he wants. That he chooses not to doesn’t create stability. We are still in the same position of instability and uncertainty with these wild fluctuations that markets have been reacting to. I guess it’s good that he’s responding to market panic, but I would prefer not to panic the markets by following the laws that Congress passed and what our Constitutions says. There’s another piece of this, which is that the FTC continues to operate. It’s in court right now against Meta, and it filed a case against Uber. Chair Ferguson told our reporter Lauren Feiner at a conference that he has to “obey lawful orders,” and that he will pull those cases if the president asks him. But he would be surprised if the president asked him to stop prosecuting Meta or anyone else. Do you think that’s a viable position? Is he saying what he has to say? Is he managing Donald Trump? Is that what he really believes? AB: Let’s add a little meat to that bone, okay? Let’s just add some words to what you described. You have the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission say, “I think this trial is important. I think we are in the right in suing Meta. I think the law is on our side.” He said early on in his tenure, to his great credit, “I want to keep on going with this lawsuit.” You have a law enforcement official making that statement. You also have a law enforcement official saying at the same time, “But if the president gives me an order to drop that lawsuit, I shall do so.” Who is being served by that world? Is competition being served by that world? Are startups being served by that world? Who is helped by that scenario? The other thing that’s very important to underscore is that just because he has not been fired does not mean he is not being influenced. Just because the people haven’t been fired doesn’t mean that they haven’t changed their behavior as a result of a very clear commandment: if you obey, you will stay, and if you don’t, you won’t. Every single person serving in government will tell you that that’s what’s happening right now. So for me, I look at that and I don’t see law enforcement or the mission of the Federal Trade Commission being served by that in the slightest. It is notable that Mark Zuckerberg paid a bunch of money to build a library. He was on stage at the inauguration. He was in the Oval Office in the run-up to the Meta trial. But then he was on the stand giving testimony, and [Instagram co-founder] Kevin Systrom was on the stand. Why do you think that happened? Was is just not effective? Do you think Trump doesn’t like the bling? AB: Look… wait Trump what? He doesn’t like the bling. RS: He likes the bling. Trump is more of a classic necktie guy and [Zuckerberg has shown up with Caesar shirts. AB: I shall not speculate on that point. Let’s just talk about the meeting. In any recent Republican or Democratic administration, a megadonor visiting not just the White House but the Oval Office to meet with the president after having donated $1 dollars to the inauguration to ask for a law enforcement action to be dropped against them would be front-page news for days. It would be considered wildly inappropriate, and it would be considered antithetical to the mission that the commission was charged with doing. I don’t really care what happens after that. The simple fact of that meeting being observed and noted by everyone serving in these positions of leadership– RS: I’m going to put it a little bit more bluntly. AB: Please. RS: Bribery is bad even if it doesn’t work. Bribery is a problem even if it isn’t effective. We have a system of laws based on the idea that you prevail if the facts and the law are on your side and not because you tried to bribe anyone in the system. If we do not resist even efforts at bribery with every fiber of our being, we are doing an enormous disservice to the rule of law, administration of justice, and the operation of our democracy. I mean, genuinely and fundamentally, I think it’s that serious. So bribery is bad even if it doesn’t work. Let me push on that just a little bit. Do all these guys just suck at bribery? Because they’re all in there. The Meta case is going, Google is losing its cases. AB: Let’s talk about another gentleman who was on the stage at the inauguration, Mr. Bezos. Mr. Bezos gave $1 million dollars to the inaugural fund. His company cut a deal that would benefit the first lady to the tune of $29 million, according to the New York Post. His company separately licensed the rights to The Apprentice, which as you might imagine didn’t cost a small amount. Subsequent to most of these things, the new [Occupational Safety and Health Administration nominee] in the United States was a former Amazon executive. This is a company that has, according to numerous studies, an injury rate two times higher vis-à-vis other large warehouses. This is a company that has so many injuries on the warehouse floor that the vending machines there dispense painkillers. This is a company that, according to a Senate investigation, was denying outside referrals to medical care of its own warehouse employees for up to 21 days allegedly as a matter of policy. After you flow in a minimum of $30 million-plus dollars into those coffers, I think having the nation’s leading workplace safety law enforcer be a former executive of your company is astounding. So, I don’t know if these donations are not working, necessarily. RS: I also think that if bribery doesn’t work, the reason is because the bribee says, “No thanks. I don’t do bribes.” If they say, “Cool, give me your dollars,” and then you don’t get what you want, your message is to give more dollars, right? That’s what I think we expect to see. To Commissioner Bedoya’s point, Amazon is also in not one but two active litigations with the FTC right now and is under order for a number of other things. In one of those cases, we saw an FTC attorney go into court and say, “Because of the DOGE cuts and resource constraints, we’re going to have to delay this trial.” Now, Chair Ferguson had him walk that back very quickly, but nothing that attorney said in that courtroom was wrong, right? It was all true in terms of the resource constraints that the agency is facing and the effect that has on active cases and investigations. Is it direct influence? I don’t know. I am not in the minds of the influencers here, but I think it’s all stuff that should make us pay very close attention and be very concerned. Let me ask about the Amazon case specifically. I think of the Amazon case, and I instinctively think of Lina Khan. She came to prominence writing “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox.” She became the chair of the FTC. She was a flash rod of controversy. Ferguson got his job by insisting that he would throw out all of her ideas. He hasn’t though, right? He’s kept the merger guidelines, and he’s stayed in litigation against these companies. The Amazon case is the hard one. That’s the one where we might actually litigate the consumer welfare standard and, win or lose, change that precedent. Do you think that one is at the most risk or is it the Meta case? Because I associate the Amazon litigation with Chair Khan so directly that it feels like it would be the first one to go. RS: It’s hard for us to know what’s at the most risk. I see big, flashing, red danger signs all over the agency’s agenda right now. I think that case is important. Chair Khan wrote a piece, a very influential piece, about Amazon, but that is not what that case ended up being about. I actually really think everybody should read that case because what that case says — Commissioner Bedoya and I both supported that case, and I think we’re very proud to do so — was that you might associate Amazon with lower prices in your mind. But actually, the evidence shows that its conduct was raising prices not only on its own platform but across the internet, hurting not only consumers but also the sellers. So, it was exercising monopoly power in both directions. I think it reads much more like a traditional antitrust case than many people might have expected it to. We’ll see what happens in litigation if it gets to litigation and if it’s properly resourced. It’s very, very hard to know what’s actually happening behind the scenes if you’re not on the case team. So we’ll see. What everybody should want is the confidence that the law is being administered without fear or favor and not with thoughts about whose donors are going to be mad or when the phone might ring and ask you to totally change direction. That’s just bad. You can think the FTC is right or that the FTC is wrong, but you should want that case to be litigated on the merits. Period. Full stop. AB: Let me also speak to something else you said Nilay. I say this to someone who’s lived in D.C. for I think 17 years or 16 years. I think Chair Kahn was controversial in Aspen, Davos, and Sun Valley. You go and talk to a rural grocer in Utah. You go and talk to the urban grocer in North Tulsa. You go talk to corn growers and cattlemen in Iowa about the work she led and that we worked with her on. It is the opposite of controversial. The response you get is, “What took you guys so long? Thank god. Where have you been all this time? I’m so glad you’re doing this.” I get the same news sources. I’m not saying it’s coming from The Verge, but you get rained on by all this press that is focused on the stock market and Wall Street, saying all sorts of things. Half my family lives in Louisiana now. You go talk to them about the work we did. It’s a whole lot of nodding and a whole lot of support. So, I think there’s a certain picture of Chair Khan that’s been painted that’s true in very specific circles of this country. That’s the first thing. Let’s talk about that Amazon case and what it’s about because I think some of the details get lost in this big title, “Amazon.” This is what we allege in that complaint. Number one, we alleged Amazon is a monopolist in that online retail market. We allege it has so much market power that if you’re a small retailer or a small seller, you need to be on Amazon. So once it has you, we allege it slowly started jacking up the price of selling your goods on Amazon, so much so that eventually, almost 50 cents of every dollar you made on that site had to go to Amazon. So what happens? Find me a small seller who can afford to have a 50 percent haircut on every dollar they sell. So people start saying, “Oh wait, I can sell for lower off the site and make a bigger margin because I’m not taking a 50 percent haircut on every sale I make on that site.” So, we allege that when those small sellers moved off the site to sell for 10, 20, 30 percent less, that Amazon used a surveillance system to find those people who were [whispers] lowering their prices and penalize them by knocking them out of the preferred placement on the platform. You say, “It turned the consumer welfare standard on its head.” I think consumers are hurt by this, and that is emphatically part of the argument that’s being made here. I also think small sellers are hurt by this, but this is something that hurt people who wanted to pay less, and it was hurting the small retailers as well. All right, I promise not to do another 20 minutes on hipster antitrust in this room. I can do it. AB: No, no, no, we’re ready for it. Let’s talk about Meta, which is indeed on the cutting edge of privacy in exciting ways. It’s at trial right now. That case was filed in 2020 under the first Trump administration. It was dismissed in 2021 under Biden and refiled. It’s back now. The heart of that case, to me, is an extraordinarily complicated market definition: personal networking services. There’s no one in that category except Snap and a thing called MeWe. How did we get there? It feels like what Meta is really keying on is being nonsensical. RS: You’re doing hipster antitrust again. We’re back in it. Look at me. RS: Look, all antitrust cases are about market definition to a degree, and it’s a very tortured thing that makes people hate lawyers, honestly. The concept of antitrust law is very simple. The administration of it gets very complicated. So yes, most antitrust cases are about market definition, and market definition is always hard. Everybody has a different view about what the right way to define a market is that gets litigated. What that case is really about is whether Meta bought competitors to eliminate the risk of competition. That’s the argument at the end of the day. Did it not want to compete on its merits but instead take out potential competition through acquisition in order to build and maintain a monopoly in a way that’s illegal? That’s what’s going to get litigated. But it’s not a lot more complicated than that, even if there’s going to be hours of debate around what an appropriate market definition is. The reason I ask about that in this context is because Kevin Systrom is on the stand right now just dunking all over his acquirer. By the way, if all of us can have the confidence to sell our companies for a billion dollars, show up seven years later and say, “That sucked,” that’d be great for all of our self-esteem. It’s clear he didn’t like it. He’s saying very loudly they wanted to smother Instagram. That’s how he felt when he was running Instagram as part of Meta. But it still feels like Instagram got huge anyway and had Instagram been a separate company, I’m not sure it would’ve competed on a better privacy policy, or less personalized advertising. Kevin Systrom showing up on SuperLive being like, “I’m not listening to you,” does not feel like a likely outcome of Instagram being an independent company. I’m wondering, as you think about this landscape and all of the problems with consumer protection, what competition solves there and what do you need a regulatory regime to actually solve? RS: That’s a really good question. I think the point that you’re making about what the counterfactual looks like is the hard question anti-trust agencies grapple with every time they’re faced with a merger. Every time you have to review a merger, the question is, “What happens if this company gets acquired and what happens if it doesn’t?” You have to make predictions about what will happen in the market, and that’s hard. That’s a hard thing to do. That’s okay, we can do hard things. I think that the counterfactual is hard to do here. That’s true everywhere, and it’s just impossible to know, honestly. So the question is, “Did [Meta] do the acquisition to eliminate this risk of competition?” more than what the counterfactual universe of [an independent] Instagram looks like. The question that you asked about why this matters for privacy and why it matters for consumer protection is a really, really important one. Not for nothing, but Meta is also under order with the FTC for privacy violations, a renewed order that was issued in 2019 — from which I dissented — for which it paid $5 billion, and it’s currently in an administrative proceeding at the FTC over whether or not that order should be modified because there are further questions about privacy practices, including ones involving children. One of the reasons competition matters, and one of the reasons I think you see so many consumer protection cases against companies where we also have competition concerns, is because without meaningful competition and the ability for customers to vote with their feet and take their business to companies with better products that are less violative, you have an incentive to commit these violations, including to build market share. I’ll go back to an Amazon example. One of the orders that Amazon is under with the FTC right now involves Amazon Alexa devices’ illegal collection and retention of children’s voice recording info. Why did it do this collection of children’s voice data? It was in order to train its AI. So that’s, to me, a very clear example of a consumer protection violation that was orchestrated to build market share and market power. Going back to why you should care about us or our jobs — I mean, maybe you don’t care about our jobs — and why you should care about the institution existing is because it does have this cross-jurisdictional lens where it can look at competition and consumer protection. I will say, we haven’t done that very well historically. I think we have really treated these issues as siloed, but over the time I’ve been at the agency, we’ve been working really hard to integrate those functions better and understand the actual market dynamics that are leading to the kinds of problems we’re seeing both in competition and consumer protection. Let me push that again. If this case is successful and the government succeeds in spinning off Instagram and WhatsApp, do you think there’ll be a meaningful benefit to how consumers experience privacy on these platforms? RS: One would hope. One of the things that’s very frustrating about antitrust law is that ex-post enforcement is long, slow, and takes forever, and it’s very difficult to fix problems once they’ve started. One of the important purposes of bringing these cases is to prevent the next round of problems and to send clear signals to the market about the kinds of transactions that are illegal and should not happen to begin with. Yes, I would love to see healthy thriving competition with social media platforms, but I would also like to see that competition continue with new entrants, new innovation, and organic growth that isn’t just orchestrated through acquisition. Do you think anything short of a breakup would be effective there? Like a long compliance regime? RS: I’ve been talking a lot. You talk. AB: No, I think you are most familiar with the case having voted it out. We’re answering a lot of questions about a case that right now is in trial, and so I don’t feel particularly eager to expound even more on it myself. You know what you’re talking about, so you should. RS: I’ll talk generally about remedies. Everybody talks about what we call “structural remedies,” breakups as this radical approach. I find that very confusing. I actually think structural remedies are a much more small-c conservative approach because they keep the government out of the business and have the businesses operating independently. My impression over the time I’ve been at the FTC has been that complicated compliance regimes are very difficult to administer, less likely to be effective, and can, in fact, interfere with the free market operation of companies. That’s a weird thing for a Democrat to say, right? I generally like government. I think it can and should be a force for good. But I do think that administrability is a real concern in what we call “behavioral remedies.” Going back to the privacy focus, we’ve seen a lot of that concern in privacy remedies where we have complicated compliance regimes. Figuring out if they’re actually working and fixing the problem is not always that easy or clear. I want to ask one more question about privacy as a general concept and then I want to end with some AI questions. There are a lot of reasons to feel nihilism in 2025 in America. One that I get from our audience at The Verge all the time is that privacy is just lost, that it’s over. Everyone is listening to us all the time. The data has been scraped, it’s gone. Apple should just give in and make a better AI system by scraping everyone’s data, and that it won’t do it is holding it back. You can’t put this genie back in the bottle. I hear this from our audience all the time. Then, I see things that I find very amusing in a dark way, like everybody on Instagram posting a screenshot saying, “I command Mark Zuckerberg to not take my data” like an incantation, and it’s great. I look at that as the clearest market signal anyone can ever get. Everyone on my platform says, “I hate you,” but they can’t go anywhere and the terms of service do not change. They do not get renegotiated in the face of that. That is where the regulator should come in and say, “Everyone wants you to change your terms of service.” Do you think it’s just litigation that gets this done? Do you think that there is an ability through regulation to put this genie back in a bottle? RS: I have said for a long time that Congress should pass a more specific privacy law. My own views about the contours of that law and what it should look like have evolved. When Congress started talking about it looked a little bit more like a notice and consent regime, and we all think that’s a terrible idea. We do not need more cookie banners. I think a minimization-focused regulatory approach would make a lot more sense. In fact, Congress got pretty close last year. Commissioner Bedoya and I both worked on the Hill. My experience of the legislative process is that it is absolutely torturous and everything is impossible until it’s a law. It’s never going to happen, and then it’s a law. So that fight needs to continue. I think the best evidence that people actually really do care about privacy comes from the data out of Apple’s “ask not to track” system. I can’t remember what the numbers are, but the number of people who, when given the option to track or not to track, choose, “Please ask the app not to track” is overwhelming. That is a clear market signal that people actually would prefer, given the option, not to have their data shared. Where the trade-offs come up in that, like if they’re willing to get a free service in exchange for sharing data, are personal and complicated. But as a general approach, even though I think people sometimes feel like it’s a lost cause, they don’t want it to be. We have agency and we can work to change that process. AB: I agree with everything Becca just said. I would add these thoughts. The first is that we haven’t lived in a world in recent memory where people have experienced what it’s like to have a meaningful online life with privacy. We’ve lived in a world where you’ve got a bucket with nine holes in it and a bucket with 10 holes, and both of those buckets suck. No one wants a leaky bucket, and so it’s hard to get excited about the bucket with nine holes in it as opposed to the one with 10 holes. I don’t think we’ve really lived in a world where we can say that people don’t care because I don’t think they’ve ever experienced it. That said, I would point to two things that show me that people are changing their behaviors in response to what they perceive as the threat to their privacy. First of all, I have no idea how old you are, Nilay, but I know that Commissioner Slaughter and I are roughly the same age. You remember when we were in law school? The stuff people would put on Facebook was crazy. People would put everything up there. Now, you go up there, there’ll be one thing about politics, one post like, “Hey guys, I’m going to go for a long ride. What should I play for the kids in the back?” People are much more guarded on social media now than they were before. Secondly, look at the uptake in encrypted messaging apps like Signal and WhatsApp, especially in Washington, D.C. Signal is very popular here from what I’m told. AB: Quite prevalent, but it’s not just in Washington D.C. RS: And not just for war plans. AB: Exactly. You see a lot of people in business using Signal by default, and not just in areas where there might be some actual commercial espionage, so to speak. So, I do think you see very clear indications that people care about their privacy even though they’re living in that world of leaky buckets. RS: I’m being a little flippant and making jokes, but I think we’re also in a moment where privacy has very real serious implications for people’s safety, security, access to healthcare, religious worship, political activity, all of these things. We’re seeing very real, very scary consequences happening to real humans who are not able to operate with privacy, and that’s something that is going to change behavior, too. That is connected to this administration and its attitude towards data, to Elon Musk and DOGE. Do you think this administration is positioned to advocate for privacy while they are interlinking databases and using AI tools to surveil Americans? RS: No. AB: No. I guess that’s the answer. I was hoping that you both would say that. RS: I can’t tell if you’re baiting us, but it’s just a no. I’m baiting but in a fun way. My friend Casey Newton has this phrase he uses called the “Splinternet.” He says the internet is going to fragment, not for technical reasons but for political and social reasons. What I see is that we’re about to build a very different kind of internet in the United States that has much fewer privacy protections while Europe begins to regulate tech platforms much more strongly. It issued fines just recently against Apple and Meta. That’s the sort of thing that breaks down data sharing across our different internets, across our different platforms. How do you see that playing out? Do you think we can put that genie back in the bottle and make it possible for European governments to trust our companies? AB: Sorry, what genie again? If our government starts allowing widespread data sharing within itself and stops advocating for privacy, stops pursuing a privacy law, or lets platforms share data more openly, which it appears to be doing. AB: Let me speak very frankly here. What this administration is doing in terms of data sharing is a direct heir of everything that President Biden did, everything President Trump did in his first presidency, everything that President Obama did. In terms of law enforcement sharing information within the federal government, it has been an upwards trajectory arrow with every single administration. It is not like this administration with immigration enforcement, for example, is building a system that was previously non-existent from scratch. That is the opposite of what’s happened. These systems have been ready for many, many, years. I candidly don’t think that the data sharing that’s being discussed today is radically different from the data sharing the federal government enacted prior to this administration. There’s a lot of other areas in which I disagree, but I think we need to be fair about this and the trajectory that intra-US data sharing has taken in recent years. RS: I’ll push back on that a little bit because I think there is a substantial difference. At least in the previous administrations, there was support for independent oversight of some of that data use and sharing, such as the existence of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) and the checks on national security surveillance. That independent oversight, including at the FTC, has been part of what supported adequacy decisions in Europe and the ability of US companies to process the data of Europeans. I do think we’re headed into a direction where that is going to be challenged, and it’s hard for me to see how those challenges are not effective. Who suffers when that happens? Who suffers if we have a different European internet? Humans, people who want to use the internet and communicate with each other suffer. That’s a problem. But also American businesses suffer. When I was working on the Hill, the biggest lobbying that we got over what was then the umbrella agreement was from US companies who wanted to be able to do business in Europe. Sure, the threats to cut off US companies from European market access will penalize Europeans, but it will really penalize US business. That is a profitable market for them, and that’s going to be a problem that I expect they will not be quiet about. I think we’re headed in that direction. Fundamentally, there’s a big difference because privacy is a legal value in Europe in a way that it is not in the US. It’s not enshrined in the same way in our Constitution here. There’s always been this differential view. How it plays out in practice is going to be the subject of a lot of debate, discussion, parliamentary debate and discussion, litigation debate and discussion, and I don’t think it’s going to get resolved anytime soon. One or two more questions about AI. AI companies make a lot of promises. They’re building digital god, they will replace your doctor– AB: Sorry, did you say digital what? Digital god. AB: Digital god. Got it. It’s just a phrase that I get to hear in my job. Totally normal. AB: That’s awesome. I run a magazine about cell phones. Super normal thing for me to hear all the time. An AI executive literally told me last night there would not be doctors and lawyers in the future because AI could just do it. This is the claim level that I hear on the regular from these companies. I don’t think they can do it. Maybe they can, maybe they can’t. It seems like they’re going to make a lot of people a lot of promises about the efficacy of their products. How would you address that in the trade context? AB: Let me address it in the regular human context. That is idiocy, the idea that there will be no doctors in the future. How long have we had printers? Forty years? How well does your printer work? You’re going to let an AI doctor diagnose you for life or death matters, let alone a wart? I think this idea is inane and should not be treated with any degree of respect. I have been shocked by some of the things that these AI execs get away with saying. Someone who runs a company that is valued at something like half a trillion dollars should not be able to say that sentience will be an emergent property in the near future. That is something that anyone who’s familiar with the technology does not think is a serious take unless there are other things going on. Have you ever been to a chili cook-off and a guy arrives like, “I don’t know what’s going to happen here! Could get pretty crazy with my chili!” These claims are what lawyers would call puffery and need to be treated as such. RS: It’s also nothing new, right? For a century, the work of the Federal Trade Commission has been to police misleading claims about what products can do. We do it with so-called medicinal products, dietary supplements, and technology products. This is not new. One of the things that Commissioner Bedoya, Chair Khan, and I have been saying for years now is there is no AI exception to the law. It doesn’t create special rules for AI. We apply the same rules, which are that you can’t misrepresent what your product can do. You can’t lie about it and can’t commit deceptive or unfair acts or practices. That’s true with AI products, too. Out of the body of work that the FTC has brought around AI in the last several years, some of it has been with an eye towards competition so that there is healthy competition in this, I think, incredibly important and valuable technological tool that is not the same as replacing doctors. But a lot of it has also been about misleading claims, business opportunity scams, people saying they’re get-rich-quick schemes, and it’s all the same sort of thing we’ve seen with every other technological iteration over the last 100 years. I think it’s important to take a step back and see through what is new, interesting, different, innovative, or a valuable tool, and what is just the same stuff we’ve been seeing for decades. I would say very few people thought their laser printer was alive, which is a meaningful difference that comes up over and over again. AB: The point is how well does your printer work? Does your printer work awesome? I write a printer recommendation every year. I’ll send you some. AB: Please, please. This is a real thing. AB: Raise your hand if your printer works awesome. This guy right here. AB: Yeah, thank you. One hand, two hands. I’m not going to endorse products. AB: Seriously raise your hand if your printer is awesome. Two hands. What’s that? What printer?Yeah, see? He knows. AB: Brother laser printer. Take the recommendation otherwise because the other 98% of the room does not think their printer is awesome. There’s affiliate links on theverge.com. The promo code is printer. RS: I think your point is that generative AI is messing with people’s brains because it looks human and it’s not human. Are we confused about how to deal with this technology? That is very true. Understanding how to relate to technology and how to process what’s real and not real is a challenge for people. I remember when AirPods first came out, and you’d see people walking down the street talking to themselves, and everyone would be like, “What is happening? This is a very weird social scene.” They did not understand. Then, we became accustomed to it and learned how to interact with it. I remember when smartwatches came out, and all of a sudden you’d have people in meetings checking their watches constantly. I remember the first time it happened to me, and I was like, “Am I so boring? Are they just counting the seconds until they can get out of this meeting?” I realized that they were getting messages and just peeking down. It’s just a different evolution. I do think there’s some of that, and this is a particular push for people. I think we need to be extra sensitive and careful about what it means for children, where we think about if judgment is available to do some of that social processing. I’ll go back to a really important case that the FTC publicly announced. It was referring to the Department of Justice in January against Snap. We didn’t make the complaint public, but we made the referral public and the general series of allegations involving the way Snap’s AI chatbot interacted with children. Now, Chair Ferguson wrote a very long and public dissent when he was a commissioner that was basically about the First Amendment rights of chatbots. That was weird to me and concerning. That’s the kind of thing we do need to have real meaningful debate and discussion about. NP: I’m being told we’re out of time. Thank you so much, commissioners. This was excellent. We’ll have to have you back in soon. RS: Great, thanks. AB: Thank you. Questions or comments about this episode? Hit us up at decoder@theverge.com. We really do read every email!

Good morning. A software engineer who has worked at Google and Meta compared their cultures, promotion processes, and workloads. Interestingly, the more stressful company was their favourite to work at. In today's big story, Donald Trump went after one of America's top law firms. Its decision to fight back took just two hours. What's on deck Markets: Early Tesla investor Ross Gerber told BI he's even "more disturbed" after its latest earnings. Tech: Microsoft is trying to simplify its AI sales pitch, slides obtained by BI reveal. Business: Your favorite Amazon products are about to get more expensive. But first, Trump is outgunned in court. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. An "existential crisis" is how Paul Weiss' chairman, Brad Karp, described it. President Donald Trump's slew of executive orders targeting high-profile law firms triggered a fight-or-flight response. Nine law firms took flight and struck deals with the president — Paul Weiss included — collectively promising $940 million in pro bono work for the administration. Four — Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block, WilmerHale, and Susman Godfrey — opted to fight the administration in court. And they're winning. They've argued that the executive orders violate the Constitution, illegally target people and companies for their speech, and violate their clients' right to counsel. In a hearing on April 23, US District Judge Beryl Howell appeared incredulous at the government's arguments. She directed a barrage of often sarcastic questions at Richard Lawson, a Justice Department lawyer, brushing aside some of his positions as "hyper-technical legal arguments that may have no merit." On the docket, meanwhile, the administration is outgunned. The firms suing the government are working with legal heavyweights. Perkins Coie picked Williams & Connolly; Cooley LLP is representing Jenner & Block; Paul Clement is representing WilmerHale; and Susman Godfrey hired Munger Tolles. "You're a bit outmanned here," a judge quipped at Lawson when he showed up alone to a hearing in Susman Godfrey's case earlier this month. Inside the decision to fight back. In a memo to staff, Karp justified Paul Weiss' move to cut a deal with Trump by saying that leadership had "incredibly difficult decisions" to make. For Susman Godfrey, the way forward was clear. No one at the firm spoke with the White House about cutting a deal, according to two people familiar with the matter. BI's Jack Newsham and Jacob Shamsian have exclusive reporting about how Susman Godfrey decided to sue the Trump administration in just two hours. 1. Ross Gerber's not feeling too hot about Tesla. Though investors cheered Elon Musk's impending DOGE departure, Ross Gerber told BI he's even "more disturbed" after its earnings call. Even with Musk back at the helm, Gerber doubts the EV maker can mount a comeback. 2. America is dangerously close to the worst kind of recession. The country's on the verge of stagflation, a condition in which inflation is taking off at the same time as the job market is getting weaker. It's a rock-and-a-hard place situation for the Fed, and leaves investors in a pickle. 3. There are also signs, however, that investors might be able to take a breath. The stock market has flashed a handful of technical signals that suggest the tariff-induced sell-off that kicked off earlier this month may be over. 1. Microsoft cleans up its AI sales pitch. The software giant is trying to streamline how it pitches its many different AI tools — which are all called Copilot — to customers, according to internal presentation slides viewed by BI. The current approach confused customers and slowed sales, insiders said. 2. The manpower driving Tesla's robotaxi launch. The EV maker aims to roll out robotaxis in Austin this June. To prepare, about 300 test operators have been navigating the city's streets over the past few months. Here's what insiders had to say on "Project Rodeo." 3. Everybody talks (too much). Group chat overload has produced a new-old solution: the rise of voice memos. It's part of a broader trend toward speaking over texting for more personal communication. Not everyone's thrilled, though — especially when the calls happen in public. 1. Price hikes are hitting your favorite Amazon products. Some of the site's most popular items are getting pricier amid tariff news, according to data from SmartScout. Some products have even reached record highs, and it's not just an issue for customers. 2. Uber's CEO says your ride could cost less in a recession. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said the ride-hailing service is "recession-resistant" and could even make rides cheaper in a downturn — if more people sign up to be drivers, bringing labor costs down. 3. What do Delta, Thermo Fisher, and Chipotle have in common? They are among the companies lowering or ditching their guidance as tariff chaos mounts. Here's the full list of companies on edge.

Title: Scrapling - An Undetectable, Powerful, Flexible, High-Performance Python Library That Makes Web Scraping Simple And Easy Again!

KitPloit - leading source of Security Tools, Hacking Tools, CyberSecurity and Network Security ☣ Dealing with failing web scrapers due to anti-bot protections or website changes? Meet Scrapling. Scrapling is a high-performance, intelligent web scraping library for Python that automatically adapts to website changes while significantly outperforming popular alternatives. For both beginners and experts, Scrapling provides powerful features while maintaining simplicity. To keep it simple, all methods can be chained on top of each other! Scrapling isn't just powerful - it's also blazing fast. Scrapling implements many best practices, design patterns, and numerous optimizations to save fractions of seconds. All of that while focusing exclusively on parsing HTML documents. Here are benchmarks comparing Scrapling to popular Python libraries in two tests. As you see, Scrapling is on par with Scrapy and slightly faster than Lxml which both libraries are built on top of. These are the closest results to Scrapling. PyQuery is also built on top of Lxml but still, Scrapling is 4 times faster. Scrapling can find elements with more methods and it returns full element Adaptor objects not only the text like AutoScraper. So, to make this test fair, both libraries will extract an element with text, find similar elements, and then extract the text content for all of them. As you see, Scrapling is still 4.5 times faster at the same task. All benchmarks' results are an average of 100 runs. See our benchmarks.py for methodology and to run your comparisons. Scrapling is a breeze to get started with; Starting from version 0.2.9, we require at least Python 3.9 to work. Then run this command to install browsers' dependencies needed to use Fetcher classes If you have any installation issues, please open an issue. Fetchers are interfaces built on top of other libraries with added features that do requests or fetch pages for you in a single request fashion and then return an Adaptor object. This feature was introduced because the only option we had before was to fetch the page as you wanted it, then pass it manually to the Adaptor class to create an Adaptor instance and start playing around with the page. You might be slightly confused by now so let me clear things up. All fetcher-type classes are imported in the same way All of them can take these initialization arguments: auto_match, huge_tree, keep_comments, keep_cdata, storage, and storage_args, which are the same ones you give to the Adaptor class. If you don't want to pass arguments to the generated Adaptor object and want to use the default values, you can use this import instead for cleaner code: then use it right away without initializing like: Also, the Response object returned from all fetchers is the same as the Adaptor object except it has these added attributes: status, reason, cookies, headers, history, and request_headers. All cookies, headers, and request_headers are always of type dictionary. [!NOTE] The auto_match argument is enabled by default which is the one you should care about the most as you will see later. This class is built on top of httpx with additional configuration options, here you can do GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. For all methods, you have stealthy_headers which makes Fetcher create and use real browser's headers then create a referer header as if this request came from Google's search of this URL's domain. It's enabled by default. You can also set the number of retries with the argument retries for all methods and this will make httpx retry requests if it failed for any reason. The default number of retries for all Fetcher methods is 3. Hence: All headers generated by stealthy_headers argument can be overwritten by you through the headers argument You can route all traffic (HTTP and HTTPS) to a proxy for any of these methods in this format http://username:password@localhost:8030 For Async requests, you will just replace the import like below: This class is built on top of Camoufox, bypassing most anti-bot protections by default. Scrapling adds extra layers of flavors and configurations to increase performance and undetectability even further. Note: all requests done by this fetcher are waiting by default for all JS to be fully loaded and executed so you don't have to :) This list isn't final so expect a lot more additions and flexibility to be added in the next versions! This class is built on top of Playwright which currently provides 4 main run options but they can be mixed as you want. Note: all requests done by this fetcher are waiting by default for all JS to be fully loaded and executed so you don't have to :) Using this Fetcher class, you can make requests with: 1) Vanilla Playwright without any modifications other than the ones you chose. 2) Stealthy Playwright with the stealth mode I wrote for it. It's still a WIP but it bypasses many online tests like Sannysoft's. Some of the things this fetcher's stealth mode does include: * Patching the CDP runtime fingerprint. * Mimics some of the real browsers' properties by injecting several JS files and using custom options. * Using custom flags on launch to hide Playwright even more and make it faster. * Generates real browser's headers of the same type and same user OS then append it to the request's headers. 3) Real browsers by passing the real_chrome argument or the CDP URL of your browser to be controlled by the Fetcher and most of the options can be enabled on it. 4) NSTBrowser's docker browserless option by passing the CDP URL and enabling nstbrowser_mode option. Hence using the real_chrome argument requires that you have Chrome browser installed on your device Add that to a lot of controlling/hiding options as you will see in the arguments list below. This list isn't final so expect a lot more additions and flexibility to be added in the next versions! If your case needs more than the element's parent, you can iterate over the whole ancestors' tree of any element like below You can search for a specific ancestor of an element that satisfies a function, all you need to do is to pass a function that takes an Adaptor object as an argument and return True if the condition satisfies or False otherwise like below: You can select elements by their text content in multiple ways, here's a full example on another website: Find all elements that are similar to the current element in location and attributes To increase the complexity a little bit, let's say we want to get all books' data using that element as a starting point for some reason The documentation will provide more advanced examples. Let's say you are scraping a page with a structure like this: And you want to scrape the first product, the one with the p1 ID. You will probably write a selector like this When website owners implement structural changes like The selector will no longer function and your code needs maintenance. That's where Scrapling's auto-matching feature comes into play. How does the auto-matching work? Check the FAQs section for that and other possible issues while auto-matching. Let's use a real website as an example and use one of the fetchers to fetch its source. To do this we need to find a website that will change its design/structure soon, take a copy of its source then wait for the website to make the change. Of course, that's nearly impossible to know unless I know the website's owner but that will make it a staged test haha. To solve this issue, I will use The Web Archive's Wayback Machine. Here is a copy of StackOverFlow's website in 2010, pretty old huh?Let's test if the automatch feature can extract the same button in the old design from 2010 and the current design using the same selector :) If I want to extract the Questions button from the old design I can use a selector like this #hmenus > div:nth-child(1) > ul > li:nth-child(1) > a This selector is too specific because it was generated by Google Chrome. Now let's test the same selector in both versions Note that I used a new argument called automatch_domain, this is because for Scrapling these are two different URLs, not the website so it isolates their data. To tell Scrapling they are the same website, we then pass the domain we want to use for saving auto-match data for them both so Scrapling doesn't isolate them. In a real-world scenario, the code will be the same except it will use the same URL for both requests so you won't need to use the automatch_domain argument. This is the closest example I can give to real-world cases so I hope it didn't confuse you :) Notes: 1. For the two examples above I used one time the Adaptor class and the second time the Fetcher class just to show you that you can create the Adaptor object by yourself if you have the source or fetch the source using any Fetcher class then it will create the Adaptor object for you. 2. Passing the auto_save argument with the auto_match argument set to False while initializing the Adaptor/Fetcher object will only result in ignoring the auto_save argument value and the following warning message text Argument `auto_save` will be ignored because `auto_match` wasn't enabled on initialization. Check docs for more info. This behavior is purely for performance reasons so the database gets created/connected only when you are planning to use the auto-matching features. Same case with the auto_match argument. Inspired by BeautifulSoup's find_all function you can find elements by using find_all/find methods. Both methods can take multiple types of filters and return all elements in the pages that all these filters apply to. So the way it works is after collecting all passed arguments and keywords, each filter passes its results to the following filter in a waterfall-like filtering system. It filters all elements in the current page/element in the following order: Note: The filtering process always starts from the first filter it finds in the filtering order above so if no tag name(s) are passed but attributes are passed, the process starts from that layer and so on. But the order in which you pass the arguments doesn't matter. Examples to clear any confusion :) Here's what else you can do with Scrapling: Saving and retrieving elements manually to auto-match them outside the css and the xpath methods but you have to set the identifier by yourself. To save an element to the database: python >>> element = page.find_by_text('Tipping the Velvet', first_match=True) >>> page.save(element, 'my_special_element') if you want to keep it as lxml.etree object, leave the adaptor_type argument python >>> page.relocate(element_dict) [<Element a at 0x105a2a7b0>] Filtering results based on a function Doing operations on element content is the same as scrapy python quote.re(r'regex_pattern') # Get all strings (TextHandlers) that match the regex pattern quote.re_first(r'regex_pattern') # Get the first string (TextHandler) only quote.json() # If the content text is jsonable, then convert it to json using `orjson` which is 10x faster than the standard json library and provides more options except that you can do more with them like python quote.re( r'regex_pattern', replace_entities=True, # Character entity references are replaced by their corresponding character clean_match=True, # This will ignore all whitespaces and consecutive spaces while matching case_sensitive= False, # Set the regex to ignore letters case while compiling it ) Hence all of these methods are methods from the TextHandler within that contains the text content so the same can be done directly if you call the .text property or equivalent selector function. Doing operations on the text content itself includes Sort all characters in the string as if it were a list and return the new string python quote.sort(reverse=False) To be clear, TextHandler is a sub-class of Python's str so all normal operations/methods that work with Python strings will work with it. Any element's attributes are not exactly a dictionary but a sub-class of mapping called AttributesHandler that's read-only so it's faster and string values returned are actually TextHandler objects so all operations above can be done on them, standard dictionary operations that don't modify the data, and more :) Scrapling is under active development so expect many more features coming soon :) There are a lot of deep details skipped here to make this as short as possible so to take a deep dive, head to the docs section. I will try to keep it updated as possible and add complex examples. There I will explain points like how to write your storage system, write spiders that don't depend on selectors at all, and more... Note that implementing your storage system can be complex as there are some strict rules such as inheriting from the same abstract class, following the singleton design pattern used in other classes, and more. So make sure to read the docs first. [!IMPORTANT] A website is needed to provide detailed library documentation. I'm trying to rush creating the website, researching new ideas, and adding more features/tests/benchmarks but time is tight with too many spinning plates between work, personal life, and working on Scrapling. I have been working on Scrapling for months for free after all. If you like Scrapling and want it to keep improving then this is a friendly reminder that you can help by supporting me through the sponsor button. This section addresses common questions about Scrapling, please read this section before opening an issue. Now because everything about the element can be changed or removed, nothing from the element can be used as a unique identifier for the database. To solve this issue, I made the storage system rely on two things: Together both are used to retrieve the element's unique properties from the database later. 4. Now later when you enable the auto_match parameter for both the Adaptor instance and the method call. The element properties are retrieved and Scrapling loops over all elements in the page and compares each one's unique properties to the unique properties we already have for this element and a score is calculated for each one. 5. Comparing elements is not exact but more about finding how similar these values are, so everything is taken into consideration, even the values' order, like the order in which the element class names were written before and the order in which the same element class names are written now. 6. The score for each element is stored in the table, and the element(s) with the highest combined similarity scores are returned. Not a big problem as it depends on your usage. The word default will be used in place of the URL field while saving the element's unique properties. So this will only be an issue if you used the same identifier later for a different website that you didn't pass the URL parameter while initializing it as well. The save process will overwrite the previous data and auto-matching uses the latest saved properties only. For each element, Scrapling will extract: - Element tag name, text, attributes (names and values), siblings (tag names only), and path (tag names only). - Element's parent tag name, attributes (names and values), and text. That's because passing the auto_save/auto_match argument without setting auto_match to True while initializing the Adaptor object will only result in ignoring the auto_save/auto_match argument value. This behavior is purely for performance reasons so the database gets created only when you are planning to use the auto-matching features. It could be one of these reasons: 1. No data were saved/stored for this element before. 2. The selector passed is not the one used while storing element data. The solution is simple - Pass the old selector again as an identifier to the method called. - Retrieve the element with the retrieve method using the old selector as identifier then save it again with the save method and the new selector as identifier. - Start using the identifier argument more often if you are planning to use every new selector from now on. 3. The website had some extreme structural changes like a new full design. If this happens a lot with this website, the solution would be to make your code as selector-free as possible using Scrapling features. Pretty much yeah, almost all features you get from BeautifulSoup can be found or achieved in Scrapling one way or another. In fact, if you see there's a feature in bs4 that is missing in Scrapling, please make a feature request from the issues tab to let me know. Of course, you can find elements by text/regex, find similar elements in a more reliable way than AutoScraper, and finally save/retrieve elements manually to use later as the model feature in AutoScraper. I have pulled all top articles about AutoScraper from Google and tested Scrapling against examples in them. In all examples, Scrapling got the same results as AutoScraper in much less time. Yes, Scrapling instances are thread-safe. Each Adaptor instance maintains its state. Everybody is invited and welcome to contribute to Scrapling. There is a lot to do!

Title: Marketing has failed big booze but there’s light at the bottom of the bottle

Advertisement April 28, 2025 | 14 min read Listen to article 4 min Andrew Tindall started his marketing career with seven years in the commercial and marketing teams at Bacardi, Innocent, Brown-Forman, and Diageo. Now working in global marketing effectiveness, he reckons the drinks trade has lost its way. A still from I'd like to buy the world a Coke, where they are holding Guinness instead My marketing career began in the drinks business where I developed three bad habits: I’m a sugary juice fiend, I spend far too much time in the pub, and worst of all, I became a certified drink-marketing-wanker (DMW). We are all one or two friends removed from a DMW. You just have to learn how to spot them: All their friends work in booze marketing or behind bars. They constantly outdo each other’s cool new “hidden” bar, like a liquid cultural capital dick-measuring contest. They have WhatsApp groups to debate ad launches, innovation flops, and gossip about people moves like they actually matter to anyone outside Soho. It is the category-navel-gazing that completely screws a DMW’s objectivity so much so that they start thinking a new hard seltzer or gin launch is genuinely culturally significant. However, good DMWs recognize this and rely on customer data to make decisions instead of just pleasing their mates. I’m now three years DMW clean, having left drinks marketing to work in marketing effectiveness. Sure, I still occasionally swirl a mezcal negroni while chortling at the latest celebrity acquisition, but mostly, I’m out. After working across different categories and markets, I can confidently confirm that the drinks category isn’t what it was. I don’t take any joy in writing this. Ignore what that CSO wrote about me on the back of the toilet cubicle door at the Groucho Club; I always try to keep things positive. Yes, there are some brilliant exceptions, but we must wake up and smell the sambuca. The industry that once produced the best marketers has fallen off the wagon. Marketing has failed big-booze. Big-booze stock prices are drunkenly falling. The top houses are all more than 30% down; one is literally down 79%. Listening to industry folk trying to explain this decline quickly sorts them into four camps: The Lifer: This person holds a golden DMW card, is an expert at boardroom politics and has survived 10+ restructures. They’ll always cite “macroeconomic factors.” The Marketing Non-Believer: Considers marketing a cost and (quite rightly) points out how hard procurement teams have dropped the ball. A good example is the tequila mess, where no one could get enough agave, and now there’s a massive oversupply. Whisky planners forecasting 20 years of barrel aging into the future must be howling. The Clueless: Always the loudest. They claim culture has changed (alcohol has become less relevant), people are trading down to cheaper brands, and revenues are slumping as people leave the category for alternatives. The Minority: Understands marketing’s role, so cringes at The Clueless. Knows proper marketing keeps brands in culture, grows categories through penetration, and allows you to charge a premium. You can usually work out which group someone falls into by asking them why the Coca-Cola share price remains impervious to decline and gets Warren Buffett out of bed in the morning. Not every drink brand and business is guilty, obviously, but it’s worth pondering a few key issues. Advertisement Many spirits ads are incredibly “left-brained.” In Orlando Wood’s seminal work, the IPA books ‘Lemon’ and ‘Look out’, he showed that brands must put on a show with “right-brained” creative features to capture attention and elicit emotion from non-buyers. He was forced to name some “left brain” creative features to prove the point with data. You’ll see a lot of spirits clearly use a lot of these: vacant stares, fast cut scenes, overt voiceovers, abstracted body parts and rational product features. This style of work only speaks to the already aware and interested, and struggles to recruit lighter buyers. Elite-DMW Nick Williamson researched over 200 global booze ads and proved this in his drinks ad how-to guide: Raising The Bar. (Reach out if you want to see that.) Beyond the dependency on rational thinking, many ads from big-booze brands look, smell, and taste the same, be it grading, studios, music, sets, lens flare, and the ever-present Gen Z-esque cast. Honestly, go pick a big-booze business. Watch the latest ads from its various brands. The similarities are uncanny and hilarious. Is this procurement having too much sway? Brand managers rotating between brands? Refusal to hire non-drink marketers? I am not sure the agencies are blame-free here either. I once launched a paid Meta campaign for a whisky brand, a competitor launched something similar on Meta the week after and I shit you not: they’d picked the same music and used the same studio. Also, innovation has been replaced with chasing incremental flavors and slimming down glass bottles at the expense of distinctiveness. Or launching global travel retail “exclusives” that eventually fail and end up in the staff shop. You hear horror stories as stock prices get spicy and trousers get soiled. “We must focus on the core.” I agree; get back to brand building, not incremental flavor BS, while we wind back investment in anything that will pay back in 5+ years. Incubation and brand accelerator budgets have been slashed. And the biggest crime of all: no one has managed to arrest the endless discounting. Some of your favorite spirit brands are sold on offer in grocery 95%+ of the time. I understand grocers need their pound of flesh. I understand shelf space, joint business plans, and how you get activation space. But if you pulled that at a P&G or Unilever brand, the CMO would personally come and drag you from your desk to the front door, no matter how many times you say “revenue growth management”. Saving the largest discounts for Christmas as well is like a florist doing a deal on roses for Valentine’s Day. When did you last buy a case of beer or a bottle of spirit at full price? As one of my DMW mentors always laughs, “Why charge for it when you can give it away?” It’s hard not to rant like this when you care about the industry and brands. And you see friends losing jobs, unable to find new ones. Marketing’s role in society is to turn the wheels of commerce. It’s noble. Without exposing myself as a card-carrying capitalist too much. What really prompted me to bother writing this was re-listening to Tito’s CMO (Taylor Berry) on The CMO podcast. A rare podcast episode that I’ve found myself diving back into multiple times over the past few years. This guy really gets it. It only has six product lines (SKUs). I’ve worked on tiny, tiny brands with hundreds. Tito’s refused to jump on trends but focused on driving its brand power. It found an emotional brand platform and stuck with it over the years while still keeping it creative and interesting. This got me thinking about the green shoots we see in the industry from people who clearly get it, green shoots of marketing hope. There’s the obvious advertising and culture work coming from Guinness, maybe the less obvious, incredibly consistent ‘Do What Moves You’ Bacardi Rum campaign that gets far too little recognition for what it’s managed to do for its market share. White Claw’s creation of a global category should also be studied. The Woodsman whisky’s creation of Barry the Beaver and the results that followed, in a category determined to discuss flavor benefits, is heartwarming. 5-star work in System1’s testing and subsequent market share gobbling. Poretti’s first powerful stake in the ground with their new foxy work is also magnificent. De Kuyper’s purchase of the dormant giant Archer’s Peach Schnapps and investment in a brand refresh and new campaign to turn latent awareness into salience is poised to yield brilliant results. Honestly, Gemma Collins is exactly what this brand needs, even if the bottle refresh went a little too far. Speaking of excellent celeb use, Malibu’s new work with Brian Cox is right-brained AF. Malibu is consistently doing some interesting things to drive brand fame. It has to as rival premium coconut rums pop up left, right and centre. Cox really makes all other drinks ads (a category inherently rooted in friends, fun, and relaxation) look serious, boring, and stuffy. And AU vodka is, by some measures, the fastest growing global brand (not drink brand, brand). I can’t reference any big TV ads because it hasn’t done any. Growth has come from a genuine market orientation that birthed a garish gold bottle, a high-color high-flavor strategy (that changed the category), authentic celeb collabs, and owning where few DMWs have bothered to step foot in - a corner shop. Top-shelf vodka brands are getting shown up by a couple of mates from Swansea. But the brand that should really give us hope is the one that should be the most impressive marketing story of the past decade. Heineken’s Birra Morreti. What a champion of a brand. It's just about to overtake Peroni’s off-trade sales, off the back of the ‘Enjoy Life’s Simple Pleasures’ brand platform, which just hit the System1 database. The second highest scoring beer ad we’ve tested. Cracking work from Lucky Generals as always. It lost volume last year but managed to grow by increasing its price by 11%. You see this in about 3% of IPA case studies and 5% of WARC’s. Bloody brilliant. And its Birra Moretti Sale Di Mare (sea salt) is a great example of fluent innovation (80% familiar, 20% new). It’s not all doom and gloom. Marketers who are smashing it will raise the bar. Let’s just hope everyone gets serious and catches up before the decent ones all go and start marketing toilet roll. The minority must become the majority. Right, all this writing made me thirsty, so I went off to the pub. And not for juice. Email all your complaints about the above here.

Prep for the report with this review of how the company is doing, what analysts expect and which data points will be most telling in the upcoming Meta stock earnings presentation. Year to date, Meta stock is down almost 9%. The stock reached its 2025 high of $740.91 on February 14, after announcing consensus-beating performance for the fourth quarter and then raising its dividend. As with other tech companies, the recent expansion of the U.S. tariff policy has taken a toll on Meta’s stock price. After U.S. President Donald Trump announced a sweeping set of tariffs on April 2, Meta dipped more than 13% in two trading days. Today, the stock trades for about $547 per share. Prior to this year, Meta stock had been trending up with volatility. The stock gained 67% in 2024 and 194% in 2023 on higher revenue and earnings. Earnings growth was the headlining story in both years: Diluted EPS grew 60% in 2024 and 73% in the year prior. Key components of Meta's first-quarter earnings presentation will include updates on sales, profits, user engagement, ad prices and the company's artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives. Meta has beaten analysts’ expectations for revenue and EPS for seven consecutive quarters. The company makes its money selling digital advertising across its network of apps, and demand has been strong. Earnings have benefited from cost-cutting efforts that began in 2023, a period CEO Mark Zuckerberg called the "year of efficiency." Continued strong increases in revenue and EPS demonstrate a good balance between Meta's capital-intensive growth initiatives and operational execution. Family DAP is Meta’s high-level user engagement metric. Family refers to the company's portfolio of applications: Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. The DAP metric quantifies how many people log in and access a Meta app in a day. For a company that sells digital ads, family DAP is like inventory. When more people use Meta apps, there are more advertising impressions to sell. Not only that, but advertising demand and effectiveness can rise as the user base grows. This is because a larger user base provides more data and audience targeting options. Meta's family DAP has been increasing for years, but the pace of growth has fluctuated between 4.27% and 15.45% since 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2024, family DAP was 3.35 billion, about 5% higher than the prior-year period. Strength in ad prices indicates good demand. It signals that advertisers are generally happy with the value they’re getting for their ad investment. Alongside a rising inventory of ad impressions, this perception of value is critical for long-term growth. If ads don't deliver results, advertisers will spend their money elsewhere. Average ad price can be a tricky metric for digital advertisers. There are several huge players in this space—Google, Amazon, TikTok and Reddit, to name a few. Each is working to build its audience, which creates a continually expanding supply of advertising opportunities. Demand must grow also to keep advertising rates strong. In 2024, Meta increased its average ad price by 10%. Meta regularly reports what it spends on capital investments, including AI. Total capital expenditures in 2024 was $39.2 billion. CFO Susan Li said the company expects to spend a jaw-dropping $60 billion to $65 billion in 2025. AI represents Meta’s most compelling growth opportunity. The company is developing an open-source large language model called Llama. Morningstar reports that Llama is among the most cost-efficient LLMs available today. Additionally, if Meta can make further cost improvements, Llama has many interesting use cases—from generating effective, customized ad content for advertisers to reducing Meta's application development costs. Given Meta's investment in AI, investors want to see these use cases take shape as transformational and competition-busting business initiatives. Every global company faces macroeconomic risks. Three factors to watch for Meta are consumer spending, the U.S. regulatory environment and the ongoing U.S. trade war with China. A slowdown in consumer spending in the U.S. and globally lessens the return potential for digital advertising. Advertisers are likely to limit their advertising budgets in response. Should the U.S. or other major economies fall into recession, Meta would feel the impact as slowing or negative sales growth. Meta is currently defending an antitrust lawsuit brought forth by the Federal Trade Commission. The suit could require the company to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. Congress is also investigating whether Meta collaborated with the Chinese government at the expense of U.S. national security. How far these cases go could define Meta's future. Some outlets report that Zuckerberg has courted President Trump to alleviate his company's legal woes. Time will tell if that strategy proves effective. Wells Fargo analysts estimate that 11% of Meta's revenue comes from China-based advertisers, as quoted by Investing.com. These revenues are at risk under President Trump's new tariff policy that imposes taxes of up to 245% on imported Chinese goods. The tariff costs can be absorbed by Chinese sellers or passed on to U.S. consumers, but either strategy likely limits advertising returns. In its last earnings presentation, Meta shared a first-quarter revenue guidance range of $39.5 billion to $41.8 billion. According to Tradingview.com, analysts expect the company to produce $41.38 billion revenue, near the high end of the guidance. Analysts also expect EPS of $5.24. These numbers represent quarter-over-quarter revenue growth of 14.4% and EPS growth of 21.3%. Out of 72 analysts, 53 rate Meta a strong buy and 10 rate the company a buy. There are also seven hold ratings, one sell rating and one strong sell rating. Price targets range from $448 to $900, averaging to $710.90, which is about 30% higher than the current Meta stock price. Meta's stock price has declined in April, but this seems more related to the ongoing U.S. tariff saga than a company-specific trend. Many stocks and the S&P 500 have followed the same trajectory. Bottom Line Things to love about Meta right now are its revenue momentum, improving efficiency and exciting AI initiatives. However, the company also has some legal trouble to manage and may face short-term headwinds related to the U.S. economy and the trade war with China. These won’t impact first-quarter results, but investors should pay close attention to leadership's commentary on these topics during the earnings webcast. So far, more analysts view the legal and macroeconomic risks as temporary problems vs. long-term issues. If that's accurate, now may be the time to scoop up Meta at a good price. Otherwise, see best stocks for 2025 for more investing ideas.

Title: What Tech Workforce Changes Could Mean For Opportunistic Family Offices

ByFrancois Botha ByFrancois Botha, Senior Contributor. The Intel headquarters in Santa Clara could end up a ghost town if their planned "de-laboring" ends ... More up being an extensive exercise. The past week’s markets seem confused. Alphabet’s stock price went up after strong earnings, great news for investors, even while the company has significantly reduced jobs. Major tech businesses including Intel and Meta are cutting large numbers of workers. Public interest as seen in Google trends about these changes continues to rise, showing that something deeper than just cost cuts is taking place. These moves point to broader market shifts as companies put more focus on artificial intelligence and reconsider staffing and global trade issues. Family offices investing in public and private technology companies will likely pay close attention. Three critical areas now require their focus: managing investment risk, finding talented people, and discovering new business opportunities. Managing Investment Risk in an Uncertain Market Tech companies today don’t just deal with internal changes like layoffs and cost reductions. Bigger global issues such as tariffs, trade conflicts, and political challenges directly affect the companies’ costs, supply chains, and profits. Family offices, in turn, must now consider these global factors carefully. It's no longer enough to just review a company's quarterly earnings or internal plans. Tariff changes, broken supply chains, and shifting international trade rules must all factor into an investor’s planning. To manage these risks, family offices should carefully evaluate how global issues affect each business they invest in. They should also spread their investments across different markets or industries to lower overall risk and protect against unexpected events. People as Assets, Not Costs: Building Teams for the Future Recent workforce reductions at tech companies have placed many skilled professionals back onto the hiring market. For family offices, this creates fresh opportunity to hire talent for their own teams or for the businesses they support. Many family offices are now operating similarly to technology startup teams. They view finding and hiring talented people as an investment, rather than viewing employees as expenses. Skills related to cyber security, artificial intelligence, digital compliance, and data analysis have become especially valuable. To succeed, family offices must invest in training and developing their teams. They should encourage staff to expand their knowledge and skills and give employees the opportunity to learn new tasks. Family offices can also help the businesses they own in identifying and hiring people with valuable skills who might otherwise be missed. Success won't result from reacting after the fact. It requires thoughtful planning and a commitment to continually build and reshape effective, adaptable teams. Humans and Technology Working Together Recent tech industry adjustments have raised questions about the future role of workers. Many discussions revolve around which tasks humans will continue to perform and which can be handled by artificial intelligence and technology. These discussions shouldn’t focus exclusively on replacing human workers. Instead, effective solutions will involve people and technology working side by side. Human abilities such as judgment, critical thinking, and contextual understanding remain difficult for machines to handle and will remain highly important for years to come. Family offices that understand this reality will hire people whose skills complement technology. Areas such as compliance, ethical considerations, client relationships, and interpretation of data still clearly depend on human understanding. Importantly, family offices should look for team members who are flexible, eager to learn new skills, and open to evolving their roles as technology advances and market needs change. Staying Flexible in a Changing Market The recent tech sector changes signal deeper shifts than ordinary market ups and downs. Family offices risk serious disappointment when they follow trends without careful thought. Instead, successful family offices will focus on thoughtful analysis and maintain patience, remaining ready to quickly adapt to market changes. To navigate successfully, family offices should question popular assumptions and avoid investments driven by hype. They should examine each potential opportunity carefully and clearly. Those who keep an open mind, remain committed to learning, and think independently will be best suited to thrive. Opportunistic family offices can stand out by understanding market conditions thoroughly, thoughtfully building strong teams, effectively pairing human insight with technology, and preparing themselves to respond decisively to change.

Title: SPAS-12 History Value: Legacy and Rising Price

Time Published: 2025-04-27T14:00:00Z

The SPAS-12 shotgun, with its rich history and significant value, stands as one of the most iconic firearms of its time. Known for its unique design and powerful performance, the SPAS-12’s history and value have only grown over the years, making it a prized collectible for enthusiasts. Check out our video reel showcasing the SPAS-12 in action on Facebook and Instagram: The SPAS-12 (Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun) was a combat shotgun manufactured by the Italian firearms company Franchi S.p.A. from 1979 to 2000. Initially designed as a law enforcement and military shotgun, the SPAS-12 became iconic due to its unique dual-mode action, allowing it to function as both a semi-automatic and pump-action shotgun. Its distinctive appearance, combined with a folding metal stock, heat shield, and overall aggressive design, contributed to its cult status among firearm enthusiasts, collectors, and Hollywood filmmakers alike. The SPAS-12 was unique in that it was one of the few shotguns designed with a dual-action mode, allowing the user to switch between semi-automatic and pump-action operation. The ability to cycle between these modes gave it a tactical advantage in specific scenarios. In semi-automatic mode, it could rapidly fire shells, while in pump-action mode, it could handle a broader range of ammunition, including lower-powered shells that might not cycle in a gas-operated system. Some other notable features include: Due to its versatility and intimidating appearance, the SPAS-12 was marketed toward military, law enforcement, and civilian buyers, although it was ultimately restricted in many regions due to firearm regulations. In 1994, the United States Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB) was enacted under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act (Public Law No. 103-322). This legislation restricted the sale and importation of certain firearms based on a set of cosmetic and functional features, rather than their actual operational capabilities. The SPAS-12, with its tactical appearance, pistol grip, and semi-automatic functionality, was classified as an “excessively lethal firearm” by proponents of the ban. Critics of the law, including firearm experts and enthusiasts, pointed out that the SPAS-12 was mechanically similar to other commonly used semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns used for hunting, skeet shooting, and home defense. Despite this, the gun’s aggressive aesthetic led it to be vilified by gun-control advocates who often lacked technical knowledge about firearms (Koper, 2004). This flawed logic exposed the major weaknesses of the ban. The legislation focused heavily on appearances rather than functionality, meaning firearms that operated identically to banned guns but looked different remained legal. The SPAS-12, for example, was essentially just a heavier, bulkier version of many legally available shotguns. The law failed to target criminal misuse of firearms, instead restricting law-abiding citizens from purchasing certain guns simply because they looked “scary.” Further demonstrating its ineffectiveness, a 2004 study funded by the U.S. Department of Justice found that the Assault Weapons Ban had no measurable impact on gun violence during its ten-year enforcement (Koper, 2004). Even the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) conducted a meta-analysis and found “insufficient evidence” that banning certain firearms reduced crime rates (Hahn et al., 2005). The sunset clause in the AWB ensured that the law would expire on September 13, 2004, unless renewed by Congress, which did not occur (Kleck, 2001). However, due to the ban’s restrictions on importation, shipments of the SPAS-12 to the United States ended in 1994, with Franchi ultimately ceasing production of the model in 2000. Ironically, instead of reducing access to “dangerous weapons,” the ban fueled demand for firearms like the SPAS-12, driving up prices and making them more desirable to collectors. Today, the SPAS-12 remains a sought-after collectible, proving that cosmetic bans do little more than inconvenience lawful gun owners while failing to address actual crime. The SPAS-12 gained legendary status not only among firearm collectors but also in Hollywood and video games. It was famously wielded by Arnold Schwarzenegger’s T-800 in The Terminator (1984), reinforcing its image as a formidable weapon. Additionally, Robert Muldoon, the game warden in Jurassic Park (1993), carried a SPAS-12 while facing off against velociraptors. The gun also became a staple in the gaming world, appearing in franchises such as: This widespread representation cemented the SPAS-12’s place in pop culture, making it one of the most recognizable shotguns ever produced. Many firearm enthusiasts consider the SPAS-12 to be a “grail gun”, meaning it is a highly desirable and rare firearm in the collecting community. The limited availability and cultural significance of the SPAS-12 have led to a massive increase in its market value. When the shotgun was still in production, its retail price in the United States was approximately $1,500 in its final year of availability. By 2016, auction prices for the SPAS-12 had climbed to an average of $2,588 (Rock Island Auction, 2016). The value increase continued at an unprecedented rate, and by 2022, the price of an SPAS-12 at auction had skyrocketed to an average of $7,000. As of 2025, the SPAS-12 remains one of the hottest collectibles in the firearms market, with some pristine examples exceeding $10,000 at auction. This dramatic price surge outpaces many other classic firearms and highlights the enduring demand for rare and historically significant tactical shotguns (Miller, 2023).

Additionally, they offer custom heirloom-grade display cases and handcrafted leather goods built to last. The Benelli M2 also has the option to switch between semi-auto and pump, though the semi action is inertia blowback instead of gas-operated. That makes the cycling unreliable when the M2 isn’t fully shouldered/supported (like when firing from the hip). Similar to “limp-wristing” a Glock. I remember those things. The joke at time was that it was called SPAS because a spase is what it is. (Slang at the time among teens for another kid that was socially awkward.) Never owned one, but I did own a Benelli M3 Super 90. Pump/auto. Neither fish nor fowl. Hated it. Disposed of it at the first gun show I could. Liked all the M1 Super 90s I owned. Let’s see 1500 in 2000 money adjusted for inflation to 2025 would be 2,785 so 2016 probably would have been the last reasonable price. RE: “Critics of the law, including firearm experts and enthusiasts, pointed out that the SPAS-12 was mechanically similar to other commonly used semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns used for hunting, skeet shooting, and home defense. Despite this, the gun’s aggressive aesthetic led it to be vilified by gun-control advocates who often lacked technical knowledge about firearms (Koper, 2004).” The old piss poor sporting purpose defense of the 2A all while not defining Gun Control by its History…how dare we embarrass our Gun Control colleagues. The Founders and millions of defenseless victims of Gun Control were rolling over in their graves. Thankfully Bush II let the clinton/biden Gun Control insanity sunset. As for Franchi they produce nice shotguns. I own one since 1996. There are easier shotguns to use in pump action and reload, but when you start shooting it fast in semiauto, the muzzle rise is minimal. Also the recoil is… tame. That thing shoots fast and straight. I love it, and after many thousands of rounds, tens of thousands, it still goes as new. Top!!! “Robust build”? Except for those parts made from plastic which are getting brittle with age. Plastic doesn’t get brittle. I’ve a pair of Glocks made in 1851 and they’re still as robust as they were when Wild Bill Hickok was using them. I forgot to say. $10,000 for one of these things? What do they say about a fool and his money? This is not a three digit serial number, first generation Colt SAA calvary model. Scarcity is a bitch, see also Colt python pre2020, s&w pre lock, pre freedom group Marlin lever rifles for silliness at the low end. Could probably throw in Kimber for pre mim parts Safe, I understand. I have a 6″ stainless Python that I bought for myself as a present to myself when I got out of the U. S. Army. A long time ago. I can touch a 6 1/2″ 2nd model hand ejector target.44 Spl and a S&W 28 Highway Patrolman now. Everyone says they’re worth a lot more than I paid for them. Good. But a SPAS? No accounting for collectors, still at a loss to explain the $500+ pricing for Nagant rifles. Supply shortage caused by the war in Ukraine? Many have been spotted being used in the conflict. The market will achieve equilibrium. If they were still in production and not disappearing on a battlefield where they will never get to the US sure. Realistically it will be a long time of a lot of estate sales allowing them to trickle back into the market that has enough other desirable products to see any reasonable drop in prices for milsurp of any kind…….. except maybe m1 carbines we may eventually get some of those back in large numbers. The first thing that comes to my mind when I see this gun is “Clever girl”. Unfortunately, it’s not a shining moment for the gun.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. Then, on March 26, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a report (the “Muddy Waters Report”) concluding that AppLovin systematically used proprietary third-party data in ways that violated the terms of service of Facebook, Google, Snap, Reddit, as well as other platforms, potentially leading to backlash and service blocking and threatening the sustainability of AppLovin’s revenue growth. On this news, AppLovin’s stock price plummeted 20.1 percent, dropping from $327.62 to $261.70 per share on March 27, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding AppLovin’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the AppLovin class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/APP or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Title: 9 Pieces of Advice for a Retired Doctor
URL: https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/retired-doctor-advice/
Time Published: 2025-04-26T06:30:56Z
Full Content:
We occasionally get requests for more posts about doctors who are on the cusp of retirement or already retired, so I thought I would highlight the situation of a doctor who posted on the Bogleheads Forum looking for advice. The relevant material in the post was as follows: “I am a 74-year-old retired, divorced physician with two sons and a partner who lives separately on a similar amount of assets. I currently have $2 million in investments with an advisor charging 0.7%, and I'm afraid to do this on my own. I have two homes, each worth about $1.8 million. The summer home has many expenses but no mortgage and is adored by my children. The winter house has a $360,000 mortgage at 3.1% and I want to keep both houses for now. I choose to give my kids big extras now, so they don't have to wait until I die. One son is in the arts, and I've said I would pay for childcare if he has children. My two sons are getting married, and I would like to give one $100,000 for a home purchase in the next 2-3 years. I had expected to follow the 4% rule but am finding I need 5.5% to cover my expenses. I was in 60% equities before COVID. I sold 90% of my equities in mid-2022 because I could not afford to hold and make it in retirement. Now I'm back in stocks with 20% of my portfolio (all big American companies including LLY, NVDA, Google, Meta, V, MSFt, Cost, ADBE, AMZN, AAPL) with the rest in bonds, including Treasuries, munis, and corporates. I am thinking about switching to Bogle Vanguard index funds—e.g. [a] three- or four-fund plan. But since I am actually retired, will this give me the 5.5% return? I know I will save some on management fees, but what would Bogleheads recommend as I find I need to go into my capital? Are there other recommendations for people actually in retirement, not just saving for retirement? I would need to get a Vanguard personal advisor, but will they send me cash each month? Are they reachable if I need to make a change? Sometimes I feel the Bogle plan is one-size-fits-all, and with this state of the world, I feel I need help financially adjusting to pandemics, wars, and now a good economy which could go bad depending on the state of the world! I don't want to run out of money!” I think there are nine things to learn from this example—some for this doctor and others for those who are not yet at this stage. It does not appear that this doctor is particularly knowledgeable about personal finance or investing, and it doesn't seem she's been doing a particularly good job managing her assets so far. Yet despite doing that AND probably cutting her assets in half in a divorce, this doc still has a net worth of about $5 million. Imagine how much more that could have been when combined with a dose of financial literacy administered early in her career. House poor is when you have a lot of wealth but it is all tied up in your house. In the case of this doctor, there is $3.6 million tied up in her two houses, but the remainder of the assets total up to just $1.64 million ($2 million in investments minus a $360,000 mortgage). Two million dollars is a big portfolio but not when it is being asked to support a lifestyle that includes twice that much in housing. Selling one of those two houses changes the assets-to-housing ratio from $1.64 million/$3.6 million to $3.4 million/$1.8 million. Dramatically different. Robert Kiyosaki might not have gotten everything right, but he sure was right about the house you live in being a consumption item, not an investment. More information here: How to Buy a House the Right Way This doc has lots of financial goals. She wants to pull 5.5% out of her portfolio. She wants to give her son $100,000 and cover childcare. She wants to maintain both houses. She doesn't want to marry her current partner and combine assets and housing. She wants someone else to manage her investments. She doesn't want to run out of money. She could do any one of those things. She could do most of them. But she probably can't quite do all of them. She's going to have to decide what her priorities are. Making mortgage payments in your 70s is a drag. It's a drag on your cash flow. I don't know what the monthly payment on that $360,000 mortgage at 3.1% is, but let's say it was originally a $700,000 30-year mortgage. The principal and interest payments on that would be $36,177 a year. While the return on paying off the mortgage would be 3.1% (or perhaps even less after tax), the cash flow that would be freed up would be more like 10% ($36,177/$360,000 = 10%). That beats the socks off of 5.5%, much less 4%. This “financial advisor” is charging $14,000 a year, and they allowed this investor to sell low and are now encouraging her to buy high. That's terrible stock market behavior. What's the point of an advisor who can't keep their client from doing that? And why hire an advisor at all if you're going to control the investments yourself? What's up with the individual stock picking and performance chasing, too? It's one thing to pay too much for good advice. It's entirely different to pay too much for bad advice—not that there is any price low enough for advice and service like this doc is getting. If this doc had been using index funds for the last 20 years and had, with the assistance of a good advisor, managed to curb bad investor behavior, her nest egg could easily be two or even three times as large. More information here: The Perfect Financial Advisor How Do You Know If You Are Getting Good Advice at a Fair Price? The 4% guideline basically says you can withdraw 4% of your portfolio a year, adjusted upward for inflation each year, and expect it to last at least 30 years with a high degree of confidence. How do you apply that in the life of a 93-year-old client? You don't. It doesn't apply. That 93-year-old is not going to live 30 more years. They probably won't live five more years. Let's go back to that Trinity Chart and see what it says about shorter time horizons. Note that the study didn't even bother looking at five- and 10-year periods. The shortest period on the chart is 15 years. There's nothing useful here for 93-year-olds. But I'm willing to go way out on a limb here and say a 10% withdrawal rate is completely reasonable for a 93-year-old. That's probably going to last 8-15 more years, and that's going to be plenty. What about a 74-year-old? What's the life expectancy of a 74-year-old female? It's 13 years. It's not bonkers to use the 15-year line in the Trinity study. You can be conservative and use the 20-year line or be ultra-conservative and use the 25-year line. If she has a 50/50 portfolio, she can withdraw 7% a year and expect it to last 15 years 84% of the time. Bump it down to 6%, and it's surely going to make it. So, 5.5% isn't going to be a problem. Even if she lives 25 years, 6% would work 70% of the time (and 5% would work 87% of the time), and it isn't like she can't adjust as she goes (i.e., sell one or even both of the houses). I'm not sure where the old maxim “Never spend your capital” came from, but I suspect it was from a bunch of immortal vampires or something. The rest of us are going to die at some point, and may we all be lucky enough to be heirs of someone who thought they weren't supposed to spend their capital. If you have a $2 million portfolio and never spend your capital, you're going to leave at least $2 million behind that you could have spent yourself or given away to charity with warm hands. Probably more like $4 million. Plan to spend some of your capital in a reasonable way during retirement. It's OK; you won't live forever. This investor feels like she needs an individualized portfolio—a portfolio that can be adjusted for pandemics and wars and good economies—and an advisor that can be reachable in the event she needs to make a change. None of that is likely true. The honest truth about asset management is that we could all probably be dumped into the Vanguard LifeStrategy Moderate Growth Fund (VSMGX) (or maybe the Conservative Growth Fund if we're 74) and be just fine. Seriously. Something reasonable, anything reasonable, is going to work when combined with adequate funding and a reasonable withdrawal rate. Thinking we need something special probably just costs us more in advisory fees and hassle. More information here: Retirement Spending Is Ridiculously Tax Advantaged A Framework for Thinking About Retirement Income A big fear for this doc is running out of money. She won't ever actually run out of money because of Social Security. But she doesn't have to set the floor on her spending that low. She can raise it with a Single Premium Immediate Annuity (SPIA). A SPIA purchased by a 74-year-old female pays 9.2%. Let's say she's getting $40,000 a year in Social Security. She can take $500,000 of that nest egg, buy a SPIA with it, and raise that floor from $40,000 to $86,000. No, that SPIA isn't adjusted for inflation like Social Security (that's why delaying Social Security to 70 is the best SPIA you can buy), but she's also 74. There aren't that many more years ahead of her for inflation to rear its ugly head. Using some of the nest egg to pay off the mortgage and some of the nest egg to buy a SPIA dramatically improves her cash flow, especially when she realizes she can easily take 6%-7% of the rest each year and spend it without much fear. The decumulation phase can certainly be more complicated than the accumulation phase, but this stuff isn't rocket science, much less nephrology. You can figure it out, and even if you need a little help, you can find someone who can provide that help at a fair price. What do you think? What takeaways do you have from this real-life example? What advice would you give this doc? This doc’s scenario is a textbook case for using a risk-based guardrails (RBG) withdrawal strategy. X% rules are ham-fisted at best – rough approximations of how much money one might need in the kitty to retire with, but terrible for using as a withdrawal strategy. And if she’s doing it that way, why in the heck is she paying an investment advisor 0.7%?? Any variable-percentage withdrawal (VPW) strategy would be better for her. An RBG strategy would be even better, providing her with a maximum spending level based on her current portfolio’s actual value coupled with an adjustment trigger – up or down – based on when her portfolio value hits an upper or lower guardrail. If she could find an advisor who uses that approach it might be worth paying for rather than a ‘roll your own’ BH simple portfolio approach. As for your other suggestions, I can’t add anything else. I especially love the “you can have anything you want; just not everything you want” observation. Yes, spend it down – portfolio and all. Yes, investigate a SPIA (maybe wait until 80, though?). Yes, get out of individual stocks and into index trackers (hopefully without taking too big of a LTCG tax hit). Until I was confident that my finances were secure, I wouldn’t 1) give $100K for a house down payment or 2) agree to pay for childcare. Also, I think she should consider selling one of the houses. I am only 62 and probably have as much with my spouse as she and her ex had before their divorce if it was in the past decade. I was unable to convince myself to give with warm hands until my mother-in-law died leaving money she should have spent on herself or given to her grandkids. Now I am willing and able to distribute to our kids good portions of what she left my husband and let him trade in his old boat for a new one so long as he names it after her. Likely we could have afforded to do it without the inheritance but since we had not counted on it I am pushing myself to technically remove it from our retirement plan. However I also find myself more willing to go out to eat or tip well now that our coffers are a little fatter. Interesting that “afraid to do this on my own” is coupled with several outsized wants. She appears to be alone notwithstanding an advisor whose services has produced this inquiry and should be fired on the spot. It isn’t clear whether the investments are in an IRA or similar retirement account or a regular taxable brokerage account. I suggest starting with some accounting help with budgeting to get on a sound financial footing with no debt and appropriate liquid cash equivalents. Also possibly counseling as I read this. The investment part will then take care of itself. Not sure if WCICON replays would help, the Bogleheads University videos might, and reading The White Coat Investor and The Little Book of Common Sense Investing are musts. Dr Dahle, I think you did a great job analyzing this Doctor’s question and situation, so I don’t have much to add. Regarding the advisor, if she overrode the Advisor’s advice and made the decisions to sell out of equities initially, then I would give a bit of a pass to the advisor. It’s not clear from her statements whether that is the case but I do recognize it as a possibility. My other thought is that maybe she should watch a bit less news and thereby not worry so much about economic calamity. Love your work. Thanks. It’s also interesting that this post was written long before the election, much less the market events of April 2025. I agree about the advisor. She really needs someone to guide her better. Or at least align her goals closer to reality. I would personally be uncomfortable with her overall plans. Regarding the houses, it is a pure luxury in this day and age to have a second house. Especially if unused half the year or more. I don’t know what a proper calculation would be, but I wouldn’t want a second home unless I were worth twice what she has. Maybe not even then. I would consider turning one into a rental and if the kids love it enough they can rent it a few weeks out of the year. Otherwise if it were me, I would sell it. If not, I would personally downgrade the other priorities. Childcare alone in the California Bay area can hit 30k a year. Per child. Red flags abound in this situation. Age 74 and $360,000 mortgage don’t belong in the same sentence. Unless you can enjoy this place for just a couple more years of snowbirding and then sell it for more than what you paid for it, it would be wise to consider selling it now. I think renting a winter place for 2 to 3 months out of the year would still save you a lot of money. And if you gift your son $100,000 to help pay for a home, remember that you will be withdrawing more than that because you will have to cover your taxes from that large withdrawal (unless it’s from a Roth). And taking out that much money at once will likely move you into a higher tax bracket. It’s noble of you to want to help your adult children but you may need to reevaluate the size of your gifts to ensure that you stay financially solvent. We always hear to pay yourself first when saving money while we are working. You need to pay yourself first when in retirement as well! Interesting read. Why is it that the withdrawal portfolios often are a mix of only stocks and bonds? Seems other assets mixed in there can give a higher withdrawal when back tested. I think you should get Frank Vasquez from risk parity radio on the show. The Trinity study only included two asset classes (stocks and bonds) likely for simplicity. The concept of the study is excellent that there are sequence of returns risk and therefore you can’t take out say 8% per year even if your overall average return is 8%. However the 4% number is conservative over a 30 year drawdown. Hopefully you’re right. I’ve included real estate in my portfolio hoping for some of those benefits. This was good. I think you should do more of these analysis. There usually isn’t as much detail or as much to discuss as there was in this case. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Economic Digest: Nepal’s Business News in a Snap

26 April 2025 Time taken to read : 12 Minute KATHMANDU: Economic Digest offers a concise yet comprehensive overview of significant business happenings in Nepal, presented in easily digestible summaries. The compiled reports reflect a broad spectrum of Nepal’s economic and governance dynamics, highlighting issues of regulatory enforcement, infrastructure development, and investment patterns. While NEPSE saw a minor rebound after days of decline, gold prices fell by NPR 1,000 per tola, and consumers continue to bear inflated petroleum costs despite a global price slump—benefiting Nepal Oil Corporation’s profit margins. Regulatory tightening was evident with Nepal Rastra Bank penalizing financial institutions and the Insurance Authority revising foreign employment fund rules. Simultaneously, Facebook faces a registration ultimatum, while Durga Prasai’s multi-billion-rupee loan default case underscores growing scrutiny of corporate misconduct. On the legislative front, the government introduced a bill restricting Everest climbs without prior experience and restructured taxi service standards. Meanwhile, infrastructure remains a mixed picture—rapid bridge construction in Saptari contrasts with chronic delays in Achham and Bajura. In trade and investment, local goods from Humla found markets in China, and Koshi Province reached out to Indian investors. Similarly, the NRNA Australia pledged investment interest, pending a friendlier climate. Despite having sufficient domestic production, the government controversially approved areca nut imports, raising questions about policy priorities. Other highlights include Sun Nepal Life’s rights share issuance, a capped agriculture budget amid high provincial demands, and calls to upgrade critical road segments affecting tourism. Despite global political shifts, MCC aid to Nepal remains intact, reinforcing continued strategic ties with the U.S. Nepse sees minor uptick after consecutive losses The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) index recorded a slight rise of 2.08 points (0.07%) on the final trading day of the week, closing at 2,658.02. After four days of steady decline, Thursday saw a mild recovery driven by increased investor activity. Out of the traded companies, shares of 83 firms rose, 161 declined, and one remained unchanged. While most sector indices dropped, the trade index climbed by 17.72 points, hydropower rose by 7.73 points, and investment increased by 2.81 points. Gold prices dropped to NPR 189,600 per tola on Friday, down from NPR 190,600 the previous day, according to the Federation of Nepal Gold and Silver Dealers’ Association. Silver prices held steady at NPR 2,000 per tola. On the global market, gold was trading at approximately USD 3,325 per ounce. Despite a 23.53% decline in international crude oil prices since the start of this fiscal year, the Nepal Oil Corporation has passed on minimal price reductions to consumers while posting profits of NPR 9 billion. Petrol prices have dropped by only 6.43%, while diesel, kerosene, and aviation fuel were reduced by 8.75%. The price of cooking gas has remained unchanged. MCC assistance to Nepal unaffected by U.S. political shifts Despite the re-election of Donald Trump and changes in U.S. foreign policy, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) will continue its support to Nepal. According to Reuters, the Trump administration, under close ally Elon Musk, has ordered the suspension of MCC programs in most countries, except for Nepal and three others. Trump has questioned the effectiveness of such aid programs, arguing against the misuse of American taxpayer funds. Minister for Communication and Information Technology, Prithvi Subba Gurung, has issued a one-week ultimatum to Meta (Facebook’s parent company) to register in Nepal. Speaking at a program organized by the National Information Commission, he warned that failure to register would result in a ban. The minister emphasized that Meta earns substantial revenue from Nepal and must comply with tax and regulatory obligations, stating that no foreign corporation can be allowed to bypass national laws. Since the Mothihari-Amlekhganj petroleum pipeline came into operation six years ago, over 57 million kiloliters (5.71 billion liters) of diesel have been imported into Nepal. The Madhesh Regional Office of Nepal Oil Corporation reports that between 1,353 to 3,568 kiloliters are imported daily. In the first nine months of the current fiscal year alone, the import volume reached 851,338 kiloliters, with daily imports averaging 2,840 kiloliters in the last fiscal year. The Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) has taken disciplinary action against five financial institutions for breaching banking norms. These include three development banks—Mukti Nath, Narayani, and Salpa—and two finance companies—Janaki and Pokhara Finance. Among the violations, Mukti Nath’s chairman Bharat Raj Dhakal was found involved in unauthorized construction activities, leading NRB to issue an official warning. For the next fiscal year, the Ministry of Agriculture has capped the budget for new agricultural projects at NPR 1 billion across provincial and local levels. However, proposals from these governments have already exceeded NPR 30 billion. Minister Ramnath Adhikari stated that this ceiling includes funding for rural roads, markets, livestock programs, organic fertilizers, and crop improvement. The Non-Resident Nepali Association (NRNA) of Australia has expressed its intention to increase investments in Nepal. In a meeting with Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, NRNA Australia president Anil Pokhrel emphasized the desire of the Australian NRN community to invest more, provided Nepal ensures an investor-friendly environment. Discussions also included strengthening trade and economic ties, leveraging the investment framework, and enhancing bilateral cooperation between the two countries. The Nepal Insurance Authority has made a second amendment to the regulations governing the Foreign Employment Group Insurance Fund (PUL). Under the new rule, insurance companies must deposit premium records from the 1st to 15th of each month into the designated bank account by the 1st of the following month. Similar requirements apply to the second half of the month. Insurance companies must also submit details of claims and premium receipts to the fund manager, who must confirm the transactions. The Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport has introduced new national standards for taxi services under the “National Standards for Vehicles Used as Taxis 2081,” replacing those of 2076. The updated classification divides taxis into three categories—Ordinary, Deluxe, and Luxury—based on features like size, performance, and amenities. These rules apply to all taxis, including existing and newly registered ones. A proposed provision in the new Tourism Bill 2081 bars individuals from attempting Mount Everest unless they have previously summited a 7,000-meter Himalayan peak. The bill, registered in the National Assembly by the Ministry of Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation, also requires climbers to submit health certificates. Those deemed medically unfit will be barred from mountaineering or joining climbing teams. This bill will replace the Tourism Act of 2035 B.S. At the Nepal-India Partnership Summit held in Purnia, Bihar, the Koshi Province Committee of the Nepal-India Chamber of Commerce and Industry (NICCI) encouraged Indian investors to consider projects in the province. Committee president Mukesh Upadhyay highlighted investment potential in tourism, agriculture, and other sectors. The event was held in collaboration with organizations like the Sub-Himalayan Research Institute and the Nepal-India Centre. Sun Nepal Life Insurance Company is set to issue 27% rights shares, totaling 10,696,320 shares at NPR 100 per share. The total value of the issue is NPR 1.07 billion. Shareholders recorded by Baishakh 4 are eligible to apply during the open window from Baishakh 30 to Jestha 19. Nepal SBI Merchant Banking is managing the rights issuance. The Gandaki chapter of the Hotel Association Nepal (HAN) has urged the government to expedite improvements along the Narayanghat-Butwal section of the East-West Highway. Chairman Hariprasad Sharma Gaire stated that delays in upgrading the road have caused significant hardship for both tourists and locals, with ongoing dust and mud making travel unpleasant. The government has permitted the import of over 11,000 tons of areca nut for the next six months, even though local production—estimated at 14,500 tons annually—is sufficient. Critics argue that the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies yielded to pressure from interest groups, especially after scrapping the import quota system last month. Six bridges have been completed in Saptari within the first nine months of the current fiscal year, and seven others are nearing completion, according to the Lahan Road Division Office. Chief Ashutosh Karna said that while load testing remains pending, these efforts aim to expand road infrastructure in the district. Notable projects include bridges on the Ghode Daha River and along the Rajbiraj-Chhinnamasta road. Despite allocating NPR 3.57 billion for 13 road projects in Achham and Bajura, delays persist across 14 out of 19 contracts awarded by the Infrastructure Development Office. Among these, two are designated as provincial pride projects. So far, NPR 1.89 billion has been spent, with NPR 573 million allocated for the current year. Deadline extensions have not resolved construction delays. Local producers in Humla have successfully exported traditional food products to Taklakot, China, under a cross-border trade agreement. Mukunda Rokaya, an entrepreneur from Simkot Municipality-6, reported that the initial shipment—featuring millet and buckwheat flour, walnut oil, and more—generated NPR 1.8 million in revenue. Controversial businessman and healthcare entrepreneur Durga Prasai is being investigated for loan defaults totaling over NPR 7 billion, related to three of his projects. Previously known for leading anti-loan repayment protests, Prasai now faces allegations of threatening bank officials, including a former NRB governor. He has been taken into police custody as investigations continue.

RECAP: Asian shares rose yesterday in line with a global relief rally as trade tensions cooled and US Federal Reserve officials indicated they would be open to cutting interest rates earlier than anticipated. The SET index moved in a range of 1,127.46 and 1,161.03 points this week, before closing yesterday at 1,159.00, up 0.7% from the previous week, with daily turnover averaging 34.94 billion baht. NEWSMAKERS: US President Donald Trump has signalled a potential U-turn in his trade war with China amid continued market volatility, saying the high tariffs on Chinese goods will "come down substantially, but it won't be zero". COMING UP: On Monday, France releases employment data. On Tuesday, the US releases consumer confidence and job openings updates, and China reports manufacturing PMI. On Wednesday, Germany reports first-quarter GDP and updated inflation data; the US releases quarterly GDP and crude oil inventories, and the Bank of Japan announces interest rate decision. STOCKS TO WATCH: InnovestX Securities says that if the Thai policy interest rate is cut next week, it could provide positive sentiment for stocks, in addition to the expected boost when Thai ESGX funds begin trading on May 2. However, ongoing uncertainty about US-China trade is a concern. As well, Q1 earnings of large listed companies are starting to arrive, which may introduce further volatility. Recommended stocks are BDMS with a fundamental target price of 32 baht, CPF (30 baht) and BCP (47 baht). TECHNICAL VIEW: InnovestX Securities sees support at 1,120 points and resistance at 1,190. Kasikorn Securities sees support at 1,130 points and resistance at 1,160.

Title: APP DEADLINE ALERT: AppLovin (APP) Investors with Losses Encouraged to Contact Hagens Berman Before May 5th Deadline in Securities Class Action

April 25, 2025 13:50 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads. Following the release of these reports, the price of AppLovin shares reportedly fell by more than 12%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the claims. “The allegations detailed in the short reports and outlined in the recently filed class action complaint, detailing the purported exploitation of user data and manipulative installation schemes, raise serious questions about the integrity of AppLovin's reported growth and the accuracy of its disclosures to the investing public,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) climbed Friday, leading shares of several other adtech and AI stocks higher, after showing signs of success with AI features. Alphabet's Class A shares jumped over 4% to just above $166, before paring gains in recent trading. Shares of several other tech companies in digital advertising that use AI tools also gained, including Meta Platforms (META), Pinterest (PINS), Snap (SNAP), and AppLovin (APP). (Read Investopedia's live coverage of today's market action here.) The Google parent reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings Thursday, with CEO Sundar Pichai telling investors Google Search growth was driven by "engagement we're seeing with features like AI Overviews, which now has 1.5 billion users per month" in just under a year since its launch. Several analysts, including those at Citi and Wedbush, boosted their price targets for the stock in the wake of the results, pointing to its AI potential. Bank of America analysts, who also raised their price target, said they believe Wall Street "may be underappreciating" opportunities tied to search features like AI Overviews and AI-driven cloud demand. That trend could suggest more growth for other companies with cloud and digital ad businesses, with several set to report earnings in the coming weeks. Snap is scheduled to report next Tuesday, with Meta and cloud giant Microsoft set to follow Wednesday, and Amazon on Thursday. AppLovin is scheduled to release results the following Wednesday, May 7, with Pinterest's report due a day later.

This group brings together those who are interested in topics around oil and gas exploration, drilling, refining, and processing. Post Germán José Manuel Toro Ghio, son of Germán Alfonso and Jenny Isabel Cristina, became a citizen of planet Earth in the cold dawn of Sunday, May 11, 1958, in Santiago, capital of southern Chile.... All rights reserved by Germán & Co. Reproduction is strictly prohibited. By Germán & Co. Karlstad, Sweden | April 25, 2025 ________________________________________ The transformation of our relationship with news resembles the shift from voyaging on a sailing ship to piloting a supersonic jet. In the age of handwritten letters and horse-drawn mail coaches, news travelled like vessels charting ancient sea routes: steadily, predictably, with ample time for fact and rumour to be sifted before docking at the harbour of public consciousness. A letter from distant kin might take months to cross continents, and each word it bore was treasured with patience—information was scarce and therefore sacred. Today, we navigate a “digital Macondo hyperocean,” where, instead of one carefully composed missive, we are submerged in an unending torrent of fragments clamouring for our attention. News no longer passes through traditional verification customs; anyone may cast a message, like a piece of paper, into a bottle—into the cyber sea of Macondo—and millions may retrieve its contents simultaneously. Rather than a single official bulletin, the modern “port authorities”—governments and institutions—issue manifold and often contradictory communiqués. We inhabit a dishonest realm where every statement drifts under suspicion of falsehood. ________________________________________ In those forgotten years when the postal carriers—uniforms as strict as their expressions—imposed order upon the wilderness of streets with their mystic system of numbers, the world possessed a rigidity that made it legible. Even digits divided the righteous from the sinners: evens to the right, odds to the left. Colonel Aureliano Buendía had yet to witness the seventeen artificial roses that would blossom from his blood in the plaza, and the gypsy Melquíades had not yet returned with his parchments of miracles. Now we wander like blind men through a labyrinth of our design, our fingertips raw from brushing against walls that shift by the hour. We yearn for the certainty that once guided letters from lover to beloved across impossible distances, yet the compass needle spins madly, mocking our desperation. The boundary between right and left has dissolved like sugar in the bitter coffee of existence—a minor tragedy beside the greater dissolution that follows. In this perpetual twilight, white no longer stands apart from black, nor light from shadow. The grey mist that descended upon Macondo during those five years of unrelenting rain has settled permanently in our souls. We peer at moral questions through their haze, unable to discern their accurate outline, while ancestral ghosts whisper counsel that fades before we can grasp it. And here lies the most terrible revelation—an heirloom of despair passed down through generations: we have forfeited even the sacred right to choose. Our freedom languishes in the same distant chamber where undeliverable letters are heaped, forgotten in dusty corners where lamps never glimmer. The illusion of choice gleams before us like the golden fish Úrsula once dreamed of, always visible yet forever beyond reach, condemned to circle in waters too deep for our understanding. If we remember when we complained about the postal service, we did so because we did not know what the future would bring; it was impossible to imagine that ZIP codes would impose order on chaos and that envelopes—sealed with a quick lick and a spark of hope—would carry our faith across continents. The postal network, conceived by visionary officials and traced daily by letter carriers who mapped the world with every route, served as an invisible compass: a shared spell through which nations unable to understand one another knew precisely how to be found. Indeed, in every odd-numbered address lay a promise, in every even number, a certainty. ________________________________________ But now, adrift in a present that reeks of stale hand sanitiser and cables severed by tariff wars, we grope blindly through shattered coordinates. Postal routes, once sacred, have been replaced by supply chains that snap like threads of spittle in a dying man’s mouth. The Universal Postal Union, which in glorious times stitched together continents like the points of a single love letter, lies in tatters, replaced by a masquerade in which trade powers recite lies in diplomatic accents. In this deracinated age—a world without fixed coordinates, where addresses dissolve like salt in rain—there are no saviours in postal uniforms, no envelopes bearing redemption. The mailman’s whistle has gone silent, replaced by the hollow reverberation of footsteps that never arrive, never depart. They linger as spectres in the dust, those echoes: false promises of connection, of permanence. Empires crumble on schedule. Tyrants rot. Rebels in overalls, clutching Orwell’s tattered manifesto, rise from furrows only to inherit the same rot they sought to burn. History is not a straight road but a ouroboros, its jaws clamped tight on its tail, spinning the earth into a dizzying gyre of repetition. We exist in the parenthesis between ruin and renaissance, scribbling our names on air, sending letters to a future that rewrites itself endlessly. There is no fixed point, no destination—only the ceaseless orbit, the Sisyphean march, the myth of progress unravelling like a frayed postal route into the void. ________________________________________ Late last week, the Financial Times reported that President Vladimir Putin had “generously” offered to freeze Russia’s invasion of Ukraine at whatever line most suited Moscow. The pitch was whispered to Steve Witkoff—Donald Trump’s self‑styled envoy—during a meet‑and‑greet in St Petersburg. Never mind the optics: who better than a property developer to broker peace between armies? Washington, meanwhile, floated the notion of gifting Crimea to Russia and turning a polite blind eye while four more regions stayed under occupation. Voilà—peace! The proposal was trumpeted as the Kremlin’s first “formal” softening in three years, and some Western headlines applauded Putin’s "restraint" as though brutality measured in half‑steps were magnanimity. Less enchanted, European diplomats warned that the offer was likely bait: a showy concession designed to tether Trump to deeper Russian demands. Still, the story rolled on—amplified by Bloomberg, cross‑stitched by Swedish reporting, and wallpapered across the 24‑hour news feeds. Back home, President Trump’s standing was buckling. A Supreme Court setback and the worst poll numbers of his career formed the backdrop to the St Petersburg overture. Into that vacuum stepped The Mirror, gleefully quoting Trump, labelling Volodymyr Zelensky a "dictator" during a sour White House clash—footage Russian broadcasters replayed for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. ________________________________________ In a tableau torn from Dostoyevsky’s Crime and Punishment, a handful of nimble traders—moral compasses rattling like Raskolnikov’s heartbeat—scooped up billions on a toy‑company stock that whiplashed with every tariff tweet—sí, te quiero, poquito, nada: tariff on at noon, tariff off by dusk—while the broader energy sector bled nearly $150 billion in market value over the same 48‑hour whiplash—Brent futures slid 7 percent, the XLE energy ETF sank 6.2 percent, ExxonMobil alone vaporised roughly $22 billion in market cap, Chevron $18 billion, and the European duo of BP and Shell a further $25 billion. Clean‑energy names fared no better—ICLN (the global clean‑energy ETF) sank 8 per cent, First Solar erased $4 billion, Enphase another $3 billion, while Vestas and Ørsted together shed roughly €6 billion—altogether about $35 billion in green‑power market cap evaporated. Nor did Big Tech escape the downdraft: the so‑called Magnificent Seven—Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla—collectively shed roughly $350 billion in market value during the same two‑day window (Apple − $80 billion, Microsoft − $70 billion, Nvidia − $60 billion, Amazon − $45 billion, Alphabet − $40 billion, Meta − $30 billion, Tesla − $25 billion). In the market’s brutal zero‑sum arithmetic, one player’s windfall is another’s ruin. This time, the crater opened beneath ordinary pension funds—state teachers’ and firefighters’ plans with heavy XLE exposure surrendered an estimated $9 billion in paper value. When you roll in police, municipal‑worker, and federal Thrift Savings allocations, public‑sector pension systems saw roughly $27 billion vanish inside two trading sessions. ________________________________________ Enter, stage left, the indispensable Mr. Dmitry Peskov—because what self‑respecting Kremlin melodrama would dare proceed without its dapper master of ceremonies? A career diplomat‑turned‑spin‑doctor, he glides through marble corridors brandishing a résumé as glossy as a freshly lacquered nesting doll: fluent in English, Turkish, French, and Arabic (thank you, MGIMO—Russia’s Hogwarts for budding power‑brokers), a formative posting in Ankara, and a society‑page marriage to Olympic ice‑dance diva Tatiana Navka. The man even sports a clipped Oxford accent, as if the Queen herself had coached him between caviar courses. And of course, this week’s Absolutely‑Limited‑Time Offer™—pitched with the grin of a duty‑free perfume hawker and the menace of a Bond villain—features: 🌹 One (1) Romanov‑era Fabergé egg—nothing whispers “trust me” like jewel‑encrusted poultry. 🌹 Lifetime first‑dibs on rare‑earth contracts—corner the battery market while saving the planet (fine print rendered in invisible ink). 🌹 Billions in natural‑gas sweetheart deals—blue flame, red tape, green cash. 🌹 And—crash the cymbals—the shimmering hallucination of a TRUMP KREMLIN TOWER®, stabbing the Moscow skyline and powered exclusively by Gazprom gratitude. The Moscow Times calls this glittering hamper “bait” to reel in Donald Trump; Peskov, ever the courteous angler, insists they are merely “areas of mutual economic opportunity.” Happy birthday, democracy—your cake is Fabergé, the candles burn methane, and the guest of honour just sold the bakery. The pièce de résistance? A February 10 executive order pausing enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for 180 days “in the interests of national security.” Just in time to clear the path for all those mutual opportunities. ________________________________________ In memory of Pope Francis—the man of humility, inclusion, and the migrant—hailed, astonishingly, by both Vladimir Putin, the authoritarian leader of the Russian state, and Donald Trump, the former and current President of the United States, as though concord itself had sprouted wings. Their unlikely agreement in praising the pontiff bridged ideological chasms, creating a rare moment when these two powerful heads of state found common ground in their admiration for a man who consistently advocated for the vulnerable and marginalized.

Reproduction is strictly prohibited. The controversy surrounding the Trump administration's halt of Equinor's Empire Wind 1 project has intensified this week. New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit challenging the Interior Department's decision, arguing it violates federal administrative procedures and established permitting protocols. Meanwhile, a coalition of environmental groups and labour unions has announced plans for nationwide protests against what they describe as "politically motivated energy policy reversals." Secretary Burgum defended the administration's position in a press conference on Tuesday, stating that all offshore wind projects are under review to ensure "economic viability and energy security." Ørsted announced a strategic review of its U.S. operations in response to the current regulatory climate, potentially delaying additional offshore wind investments. Meanwhile, in Europe, Finland has joined Sweden and Italy in accelerating nuclear power development, announcing plans to extend the operating licenses of its existing reactors and streamline approvals for new small modular reactor technologies. This week, the International Energy Agency released a report indicating that global renewable energy installations continue to grow slower than projected in specific markets due to policy uncertainties, supply chain constraints, and inflationary pressures. Crude oil markets experienced significant volatility this week, with prices rebounding slightly following last week's sharp decline. Brent crude settled at $72.40 per barrel on Thursday, up 3.2% from last week's three-year low, as markets reassessed the impact of China's retaliatory tariffs. On Wednesday, OPEC+ ministers held an emergency virtual meeting to discuss market conditions but maintained their current production strategy. ExxonMobil announced a $12 billion investment in Gulf of Mexico oil and gas development, citing the administration's supportive stance toward domestic fossil fuel production. Similarly, Chevron has reactivated previously paused drilling projects in the Permian Basin. Several automakers are reconsidering their U.S. electric vehicle manufacturing investments following the administration's rollback of federal incentives. Ford announced it will delay the planned expansion of its Tennessee battery plant by at least 18 months. General Motors is reportedly reviewing the timeline for transitioning certain production lines to EVs at its Michigan facilities. BYD broke ground on its first European manufacturing facility in Hungary this week, accelerating its international expansion despite growing trade tensions. The facility will produce battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles primarily for European markets. Brazil's environmental protection agency, Ibama, reversed its technical staff and granted preliminary approval for Petrobras to drill near the Amazon River mouth, sparking protests in Brasília and criticism from environmental organisations. President Lula defended the decision as "necessary for Brazil's energy sovereignty" while promising additional ecological safeguards. India's Power Ministry announced new grid integration measures to accommodate both coal expansion and growing renewable capacity, acknowledging the country's dual strategy will continue through the decade. The announcement came as parts of northern India experienced rolling blackouts amid an early heat wave. Energy sector stocks have shown divergent performance this week, with fossil fuel companies generally gaining while clean energy shares declined. The S&P Global Clean Energy Index fell 3.2% over the week, while the S&P 500 Energy Sector index rose 2.1%. Analysts attribute this pattern to anticipated policy shifts favouring conventional energy sources. Natural gas prices in the U.S. rose to a six-month high following forecasts of warmer-than-average temperatures across much of the country, increasing cooling demand expectations. European gas prices remained stable as storage levels continue to exceed seasonal averages. The markets are closely watching next week's Federal Reserve meeting for signals about interest rate trajectories, which could significantly impact energy investment patterns through the remainder of 2025. 📌 U.S. Climate and Energy Policy Reuters – "NY files legal challenge against Trump administration's Empire Wind halt" (April 23, 2025) Bloomberg – "Burgum defends energy policy amid mounting offshore wind controversy" (April 22, 2025) Politico – "Environmental groups plan nationwide protests over wind project cancellations" (April 24, 2025) 📌 Renewable Energy and Nuclear Power Financial Times – "Ørsted announces strategic review of US operations amid policy uncertainty" (April 21, 2025) World Nuclear News – "Finland accelerates nuclear development plan to meet carbon goals" (April 22, 2025) IEA – "Renewable Energy Market Update – April 2025" (April 20, 2025) 📌 Fossil Fuel Markets and Investment S&P Global – "Oil prices rebound from three-year lows as market reassesses China tariff impact" (April 24, 2025) Reuters – "OPEC+ holds emergency meeting, maintains production strategy" (April 23, 2025) Wall Street Journal – "ExxonMobil announces $12B Gulf of Mexico investment push" (April 23, 2025) Energy Intelligence – "Chevron restarts paused Permian drilling projects" (April 24, 2025) 📌 Electric Vehicle Market Dynamics Automotive News – "Ford delays Tennessee battery plant expansion amid EV incentive uncertainty" (April 22, 2025) Reuters – "GM reviewing EV transition timeline for Michigan facilities" (April 23, 2025) Financial Times – "BYD begins construction on first European manufacturing plant" (April 21, 2025) 📌 Geopolitical Energy Developments Reuters – "Brazil's Ibama approves Amazon drilling despite staff recommendations" (April 22, 2025) Estado de São Paulo – "Environmental protesters gather in Brasília following Amazon drilling decision" (April 23, 2025) Economic Times – "India announces new grid integration measures amid northern blackouts" (April 24, 2025) 📌 Economic and Market Trends Bloomberg – "Clean energy stocks slide as fossil fuels rally on policy expectations" (April 24, 2025) CNBC – "Natural gas prices hit six-month high on warming forecasts" (April 24, 2025) Wall Street Journal – "Energy investors eye Fed meeting for interest rate signals" (April 25, 2025) No discussions yet.

Title: The Meta Trial Shows the Dangers of Selling Out

Meta has a lot at stake in the current FTC lawsuit against it. In theory a negative verdict could result in a company breakup. But CEO Mark Zuckerberg once faced an even bigger existential threat. Back in 2006, his investors and even his employees were pressuring him to sell his two-year-old startup for a quick payoff. Facebook was still a college-based social network, and several companies were interested in buying it. The most serious offer came from Yahoo, which offered a stunning $1 billion. Zuckerberg, though, believed he could grow the company into something worth much more. The pressure was tremendous, and at one point he blinked, agreeing in principle to sell. But immediately after that, a dip in Yahoo stock led its leader at the time, Terry Semel, to ask for a price adjustment. Zuckerberg seized the opportunity to shut down negotiations; Facebook would remain in his hands. “That was by far the most stressful time in my life,” Zuckerberg told me years later. So it’s ironic to observe, through the testimony of this trial, how he treated two other sets of founders in very similar situations to him—but whom he successfully bought out. This is an essay from the latest edition of Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter. SIGN UP for Plaintext to read the whole thing, and tap Steven's unique insights and unmatched contacts for the long view on tech. The nub of the current FTC trial seems to hinge on how US District Court judge James Boasberg will define Meta’s market—whether it’s limited to social media or, as Meta is arguing, the broader field of “entertainment.” But much of the early testimony exhumed the details of Zuckerberg’s successful pursuit of Instagram and WhatsApp—two companies that, according to the government, are now part of Meta’s illegal monopolistic grip on social media. (The trial also invoked the case of Snap, which resisted Zuckerberg’s $6 billion offer and had to deal with Facebook copying its products.) Legalities aside, the way these companies were upended by a Zuckerberg offer made the first few days of this case a dramatic and instructive study of acquisition dynamics between small and big business. Though almost all of these narratives have been covered at length over the years—I documented them pretty thoroughly in my own 2020 account Facebook: The Inside Story—it was striking to see the principals testifying under oath about what happened. Hey, my sources were pretty good, but I didn’t get to swear them in! In their testimony, star witnesses Zuckerberg and Instagram cofounder Kevin Systrom agreed on facts, but their interpretations were Mars and Venus. In 2012, Instagram was about to close a $500 million investment round, when suddenly the tiny company found itself in play, with Facebook in hot pursuit. In an email at the time, Facebook’s CFO asked Zuckerberg if his goal was to “neutralize a potential competitor.” The answer was affirmative. That was not the way he pitched it to Systrom and cofounder Mike Krieger. Zuckerberg promised the cofounders they would control Instagram and could grow it their way. They would have the best of both worlds—independence and Facebook’s huge resources. Oh, and Facebook’s $1 billion offer was double the valuation of the company in the funding round it was about to close. Everything worked great for a few years, but then Zuckerberg began denying resources to Instagram, which its cofounders had built into a juggernaut. Systrom testified that Zuckerberg seemed envious of Instagram’s success and cultural currency, saying that his boss “believed we were hurting Facebook’s growth.” Zuckerberg’s snubs ultimately drove Instagram's founders to leave in 2018. By that time, Instagram was arguably worth perhaps 100 times Zuckerberg’s purchase price. Systrom and Krieger’s spoils, though considerable, did not reflect the fantastic value they had built for Facebook. The founders of WhatsApp did reap a stratospheric buyout, because in 2014 Zuckerberg threw $19 billion to acquire their then tiny operation. But, as told through testimony of some of its executives and funders, the acquisition hinged on promises that cofounders Brian Acton and Jan Koum would retain control. The WhatsApp cofounders hated advertising and were adamant that no ads should ever appear on their service. But documents introduced in the trial indicated that Facebook was basing its valuation on the premise that WhatsApp would be monetized, apparently with those despised ads. The founders left in 2018, when it became clear that Zuckerberg was calling the shots. “I espoused a certain set of principles, even publicly, to my users, and I said, Look, we are not gonna sell your data, we are not going to sell you ads, and I turned around and sold my company,” cofounder Brian Acton told me. His penance for this “crime,” he told me, was spending $50 million to create the Signal Foundation. Though these founders were pressured to sell, there weren’t literal guns to their heads—and they did cash out in exchange for pursuing their dreams. So we shouldn’t feel too sorry for them. But lately people in Silicon Valley have been chattering about startup guru Paul Graham’s “Founder Mode” theory, which assumes that the person most responsible for creating a company is the best one to run it—and that the world itself benefits from such people. Zuckerberg, of course, is an iconic founder. But the trial is revealing a narrative beyond the FTC’s legal argument about anticompetitive acquisitions: Zuckerberg’s penchant for snuffing out founders to advance his own goals. Of course, sometimes founders are well advised to take the money and run. Consider the case of Clubhouse, the audio-based social networking product that exploded during the pandemic. Its founders, Paul Davison and Rohan Seth, fended off multiple suitors, including a rumored $4 billion offer from Twitter. But after the pandemic—and some poor strategic choices—the service deflated like a punctured balloon. In 2023 it laid off half of its staff. On the other hand, it’s still around, and at least in one of its recent town halls, Davison still seemed to be having fun. One question that Mark Zuckerberg did not have to answer during his testimony was how he viewed his own transition from prey to predator. But I did pose that question to him during my book research. We were discussing the mental anguish he suffered during the 2006 crisis. Zuckerberg told me that he often advises young founders not to give in to pressure. This advice, of course, was not offered to those running companies he wanted to buy. So I asked him directly—given his lesson from the Yahoo experience, did Systrom and Krieger make a mistake by selling to him? There was a long pause, not an uncommon phenomenon when Zuckerberg considers a question where a candid answer might put him in a damning position. Finally he gave a response that dodged the issue, saying that Instagram could never have reached its heights without Facebook’s support. He said pretty much the same thing in court this month. On a legal basis, Meta will not be judged on how he bought off the dreams of founders, but whether he gamed the marketplace through his purchases. No judge will rule on the calculus of selling off a dream. In Kevin Systrom’s testimony, he opined that Zuckerberg denied resources to Instagram in part out of jealousy. The photo-sharing app, which he didn’t invent, was growing faster than Facebook’s blue app, a Mark Zuckerberg Production. When reporting Facebook: The Inside Story, I became familiar with this tension and put it to Zuckerberg: Was he in fact jealous of the Instagram team? “Jealous…” he repeated. Yes, I said. And that you would prefer growth of Facebook’s Blue app to Instagram’s? He said no, and explained to me how he thought about it. Early on … it made sense to leave the founders alone and let them build their best products. “That was incredibly successful,” he says. “And it made sense for the first five years. But now we’re at the point where all the products are big and important. I don’t want to build just multiple versions of the same product. We should have a more coherent and integrated product strategy.” And if that meant losing founders, so be it. “I can understand if you’re an entrepreneur who built one of those things and had awesome success, you’d wake up and say, ‘Okay, I’m proud of what I did, but this isn’t for me going forward.’ That’s how I see it, and we’re going in the right direction.” Those close to Kevin Systrom, though, believe that had Zuckerberg not asserted control, he would have remained at Instagram for 20 more years. Jim asks, “What was it like interviewing some of the pioneers of modern-day computing for Hackers?” Thanks for the question, Jim. You are asking me to access the feelings I had over 40 years ago when I was talking first-hand to people who are now legends. But in the circles I traveled they were virtually unknown, even computer science pioneers like Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy. And to my knowledge no reporter had documented the world of MIT hackers, who pretty much invented computer culture. I do recall as the interviews accumulated, I came to realize that the story I was telling was significant and would have continuing relevance. Also, some of them outright stretched my mind. These people were so interesting that after the book was published I kept talking to computer folk. I still am. Submit your questions in the comments below, or send an email to mail@wired.com.

Catch up on select AI news and developments from the past week or so (in no particular order): YouTube tests AI Overviews carousel in search results. YouTube is experimenting with an AI Overviews feature that surfaces short clips from videos deemed most relevant to a user's search query. Available only to a small number of US-based YouTube Premium users, the AI-generated highlights are presented in a carousel format within search results. The test applies only to select English-language queries related to product research or travel. This feature mirrors the controversial AI Overviews in Google Search, which have been linked to declining site traffic. Importance for marketers: If widely deployed, AI Overviews could reduce visibility and video views, affecting branded content discoverability on YouTube. Trump signs executive order launching AI education initiative. President Trump has issued an executive order establishing a national AI education initiative and a new White House Task Force on AI Education. The order directs resources toward AI training in schools, teacher development, and an AI-focused Presidential Challenge. Despite recent cuts to the Department of Education, the administration aims to prioritize AI in discretionary grants and research. The initiative's success will depend on cross-sector collaboration and effective coordination across government departments. Importance for marketers: Broader AI literacy and workforce readiness could accelerate AI adoption across industries, influencing future demand for AI-based marketing solutions and services. Google finds UK workers can save 122 hours a year using AI for admin tasks. Google's AI Works pilot program in the UK showed that workers—especially older women in lower-income roles—can save 122 hours annually using AI for administrative tasks. Simple interventions like training and "permission to prompt" doubled AI usage among participants. The study suggests AI adoption barriers include legitimacy concerns and lack of confidence. With minor training, weekly AI usage rose from 17% to 56%. Google estimates AI adoption could add £400 billion to the UK economy. Importance for marketers: Demonstrates measurable time savings and the importance of upskilling, with implications for marketing operations and productivity improvements. Baidu launches cheaper, upgraded AI models to stay competitive. Baidu introduced two improved versions of its Ernie chatbot—Ernie 4.5 Turbo and Ernie X1 Turbo—at significantly reduced cost. The Ernie 4.5 Turbo model is now 80% cheaper than its predecessor, while the reasoning-focused X1 Turbo is 50% less expensive. The move comes amid rising competition from Chinese firms like DeepSeek and Zhipu AI, as well as global leaders like OpenAI. Baidu's share price rose after the announcement. Importance for marketers: Lower pricing and improved performance from Chinese AI providers could increase global adoption, reduce costs for marketers, and spark competitive pricing shifts across the industry. OpenAI introduces 'lightweight' version of deep research tool. OpenAI has released a "lightweight" version of its deep research tool powered by the o4-mini model. It's now available to free users (limited to five tasks/month) and paid tiers. The tool offers shorter, cost-effective responses while retaining research depth and quality. Paid users get higher limits: 25 monthly tasks for Plus/Team, 250 for Pro. Enterprise and Education plans will get access soon. The new version is significantly cheaper to run, helping OpenAI reduce costs. Importance for marketers: Expanded access to deep research tools enables teams to extract insights and automate content generation more affordably and efficiently. Microsoft reveals it used AI to create ad that went unnoticed. Microsoft disclosed that it produced a Surface Pro and Surface Laptop ad using generative AI without public awareness. The ad, released in January, used AI for quick-cut shots and background visuals, while detailed movements were shot live. Microsoft says the approach saved 90% of time and cost compared to traditional methods. Designers used AI for scripting, imagery, and iteration. Despite being live for months, no viewers flagged the AI elements. Importance for marketers: This case illustrates that well-integrated AI can reduce production costs and timelines without compromising quality or raising viewer skepticism. Kuaishou debuts upgraded Kling AI video generator, touts global leadership. Kuaishou unveiled Kling 2.0, claiming it to be the world's most powerful AI video generator. It features improved realism, motion quality, and prompt handling. Kling has already produced over 168 million videos and 344 million images. Importance for marketers: Advanced generative video tools like Kling 2.0 offer scalable, high-quality video creation options for brand storytelling and engagement—potentially at a fraction of traditional production costs. Ziff Davis sues OpenAI over copyright infringement. Digital media company Ziff Davis has filed suit against OpenAI, alleging that the AI firm copied content from outlets like IGN, PCMag, and CNET without permission. Ziff Davis claims OpenAI ignored its robots.txt directives and stripped copyright notices from scraped data. It joins The New York Times and others in a wave of lawsuits against OpenAI over training data use. The company is seeking damages and deletion of affected datasets. Importance for marketers: The growing legal pressure may influence how AI companies use web content, affecting SEO, content licensing, and the discoverability of brand content. Perplexity launches voice assistant for older iOS devices. Perplexity released a voice assistant feature in its iOS app, bringing AI-powered voice interaction to Apple devices—even those not eligible for Apple Intelligence.

Importance for marketers: Perplexity's voice assistant expands voice-first interactions to a broader user base, opening new pathways for content consumption, customer support, and task automation. OpenAI partners with NTT Data to bring AI agents to Japan. OpenAI and NTT Data have formed a strategic partnership to distribute ChatGPT Enterprise in Japan and co-develop agentic AI solutions. NTT will also launch an OpenAI-focused center of excellence and offer an AI use case accelerator program to 100 major companies. The partnership aims to achieve $697M in related revenue by 2027. Importance for marketers: Expanding enterprise-grade AI in Japan presents a strong use case for industry-specific AI applications in marketing automation and customer engagement. Adobe and Figma adopt ChatGPT's upgraded image generator. OpenAI's powerful "gpt-image-1" model is now available via API, enabling Adobe and Figma to embed it in their tools. Users can generate and edit images from prompts, adjust styles, and render text with high fidelity. Canva, GoDaddy, and others are also exploring integrations. Importance for marketers: Enhanced image-generation tools within popular creative platforms will streamline design workflows and visual content creation for marketers, speeding campaign development and iteration. OpenAI expresses interest in acquiring Chrome for AI-first experience. OpenAI's head of product said the company would consider buying Google Chrome if antitrust rulings forced its sale. OpenAI has already hired key former Chrome developers and considered building its own browser. Integrating ChatGPT into a browser with Chrome's user base could give OpenAI massive distribution and training data for agentic AI. Importance for marketers: An OpenAI-owned browser could significantly reshape web discovery and behavior, affecting SEO, advertising placement, and content strategy. Adobe adds new Firefly models and third-party AI tools to Creative Cloud. Adobe introduced Firefly Image Model 4 and 4 Ultra, offering faster, more controllable, and higher-quality image generation. The web app now supports OpenAI, Google, and others for image and video generation. Adobe maintains its models are "commercially safe" due to licensed training data. Importance for marketers: Greater control and safety in AI-generated media enable marketers to create publish-ready visuals confidently, reducing legal risk while accelerating creative production. Google DeepMind previews Astra and future AGI capabilities. In a 60 Minutes interview, DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis showcased Project Astra and discussed Gemini's evolution toward acting in the world. Astra includes memory and smart glasses integration. Hassabis believes AGI is 5–10 years away and noted self-awareness may arise implicitly, though it's not a design goal. Importance for marketers: Tools like Astra and Gemini signal the rise of context-aware, multimodal AI that can power real-time marketing decisions and immersive customer experiences. Microsoft unveils Copilot AI agents to transform workplace productivity. Microsoft launched "Researcher" and "Analyst" AI agents within Microsoft 365 Copilot, designed to handle deep reasoning tasks like summarizing meetings and analyzing CRM data.

Importance for marketers: Marketers gain advanced AI collaborators capable of extracting insights, generating reports, and optimizing campaigns with less manual effort and greater strategic depth. HubSpot acquires Dashworks to power AI assistants with deeper search. HubSpot is acquiring Dashworks to improve its AI assistant, Breeze Copilot. Dashworks enables deep cross-platform search and reasoning, allowing marketers, sales, and CX teams to retrieve unstructured data via natural language. This expands Breeze's ability to serve as a go-to-market assistant. Importance for marketers: The acquisition boosts HubSpot's AI capabilities, making campaign insights, account status, and brand data easier to access—improving speed and personalization in marketing execution. OpenAI and Shopify prepare native ChatGPT shopping integration. Code found in ChatGPT's assets shows signs of a direct Shopify checkout experience embedded in the chat interface. Users may soon browse, review, and purchase products without leaving ChatGPT. The feature appears close to launch and mirrors moves by Microsoft and Perplexity toward in-chat commerce. Importance for marketers: Native shopping in ChatGPT could open a powerful new sales channel, enabling frictionless AI-assisted buying journeys and direct product exposure for Shopify merchants. Investor claims AI is already replacing workers—especially in law and HR. VC Victor Lazarte claims AI is "fully replacing people," particularly in legal and HR roles. Critics point to recent courtroom mishaps involving flawed AI-generated legal documents as evidence that the technology isn't ready. Meanwhile, biased hiring AI continues to disadvantage certain job seekers. Importance for marketers: The rhetoric around AI replacement may shape how companies evaluate automation tools. Marketers must balance AI use with brand reputation, ethics, and accuracy—especially in regulated or people-centric sectors. Meta expands AI assistant access on Ray-Ban smart glasses in Europe. Meta is rolling out its Meta AI assistant to Ray-Ban smart glasses users in seven European countries. The AI can respond to voice prompts, offer translations, and identify real-world objects. The expansion follows regulatory delays in the EU. Importance for marketers: Smart glasses with AI capabilities represent an emerging touchpoint for hyper-contextual marketing and real-world engagement—especially valuable for retail, travel, and local discovery applications. IMF: AI's economic gains will outweigh emissions costs. The IMF estimates AI could boost global GDP by 0.5% annually from 2025–2030, outweighing increased emissions from energy-hungry data centers. Still, the report warns that benefits won't be distributed equally, and urges more sustainable deployment. Importance for marketers: This reinforces the importance of aligning AI innovation with ESG goals. Marketers promoting AI solutions should address sustainability and societal impact to resonate with stakeholders and regulators. YouTube adds AI-generated background music tool for creators. YouTube's new "Music assistant" lets creators generate copyright-free instrumental tracks by entering text prompts. Available to some users of the Creator Music beta, it generates multiple options for download and editing. Importance for marketers: The tool enables fast, legal background music creation for video content, helping brands produce compliant multimedia assets without relying on stock libraries. Creators Guild of America launches legal CGA Rider to protect content creators. The CGA has released a binding "CGA Rider" document that creators can attach to contracts with brands or agencies. It covers content rights, payment terms, revision limits, and AI usage permissions. Several platforms have already adopted it. Importance for marketers: As AI use and content reuse increase, marketers must align with creator rights protections. Using CGA-backed standards helps foster trust and compliance in influencer partnerships. Italian newspaper Il Foglio finds success with AI-written sections. Il Foglio published a daily four-page AI-written section for a month and plans to continue weekly. Editor Claudio Cerasa says AI excels at irony and summarizing books, but lacks critical thinking.

Title: Market Volatility And Monday Morning Quarterbacks
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjkinahan/2025/04/25/market-volatility-and-monday-morning-quarterbacks/
Time Published: 2025-04-25T13:49:08Z

ByJJ Kinahan ByJJ Kinahan, Senior Contributor. Google announced earnings that were better than expected, however, the company warned of headwinds ... More because of tariffs. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) Updated, April 25, 2025: This post has been adjusted to correct the spelling of Procter & Gamble. Key Takeaways Stocks staged a broad rally on Thursday, led by tech stocks. The Nasdaq Composite gained 2.75%. That was followed by both the S&P 500 and Russell 2000, both gaining 2%. Meantime, the Dow Jones Industrial Average notched a gain of 1.2%. Ten of the 11 S&P sectors closed higher with Consumer Staples being the only sector to close lower. As we get further into earnings season, we’re seeing a continuation of something that began with United Airlines. Companies are struggling when it comes to forecasting in this environment. Alphabet, who beat on their earnings report, said tariffs will be a headwind. American Airlines, PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble, and others have all specifically called out the unique nature of the current geopolitical situation and economic policies being implemented. We’re also seeing massive shifts in supply chains. Apple recently announced it hopes to move most iPhone production to India by 2026. I expect these types of announcements and changes will continue as we get earnings reports from more household-type names. Right now, the only trend to this market is that there is no trend. Technicians and fundamentalists are all struggling to make heads or tails of what is happening. That makes for a challenging situation. Therefore, I think it's important to take a step back here and discuss the broader trading and investing environment as well as how it might make sense to approach the market. We are seeing a heightened level of volatility sustain itself. Even if you are not someone who trades options, this is important because higher volatility means the expected trading ranges for stocks will be wider. It was just a few months ago when the expected move in the S&P 500 was +/- 50 points for a week. Friday alone the expected move in the S&P 500 is over 60 points and looking to next week, the expected move is over 170 points. Those large, expected moves in the index trickle down to individual stocks as well. Apple has an expected move Friday of $4 whereas a couple months ago, expected moves of the day were half that. Large moves have practical implications for both investors and traders. If you are someone who invests in stocks and does dollar cost averaging, you’ll want to take the wider trading ranges into consideration. If you were buying more stock anytime price fell 1%, you may now want to wait for 1.5% to 2%. You should also expect a greater volatility in your account value when market volatility is higher. At the moment, with the VIX around 27, the market's daily expected moves are around 1.5x historical averages. If you have a portfolio that is closely correlated to the market, expect your daily swings to be larger. If you are an options trader, a higher volatility market is what you want. Option premium is what we call, “rich.” What that means is, if you could normally collect $5 selling something like a put that expires in a month, you can now collect $7.50 to $10. Greater volatility means people are willing to pay more for options, this of course makes sense with puts to many people, as you see the downside protection. But those short calls, be it in a covered call or spread, may not go down as much as expected. Again, higher volatility, means that a wider range of stock movement (both up and down) is expected, so all options hold more premium. One of the most important things when volatility is like this is keeping position size small and defining your risk before you place a trade. These types of markets will bring out a lot of Monday-morning quarterbacks, meaning it'll be easy to say what you should have done. Before you go beating yourself up with what you should have sold or should have bought, remind yourself that there is an emotional aspect of trading. I've been doing this my entire adult life and I still succumb to the emotional aspects at times. Therefore, understanding your risk tolerance ahead of time is crucial, it helps take as much emotion as possible out of the trade as you have already walked through mentally, what can go wrong. For today, I'm keeping an eye on volatility. Some of the more esoteric measures of volatility actually have come down over the past few days, and ideally, we'll see that carry over into the VIX. However, next week is a big week for economic data and earnings. The Personal Consumption Expenditures report and employment for April are just two of the many economic reports due. Then companies like Apple and Meta Platforms, among a number of other companies, are scheduled to announce earnings. Therefore, I'm not so sure we'll see that VIX contraction just yet. As always, I would stick with your investing plan and long-term objectives. tastytrade, Inc. commentary for educational purposes only.

Title: Forbes Daily: Alphabet’s Hot Start To 2025 Despite Uncertainty

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. The rise of AI has also driven a surge in its use for nefarious purposes. But Atlanta-based startup Pindrop just hit a new milestone helping fight the increase in fraud that the technology has brought. After more than 10 years in business, the firm surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue, and such growth is driven by its efforts to fight deepfakes—digitally created hoax recordings, images or videos. CEO Vijay Balasubramaniyan said the company has seen a 111% increase in deepfake-related fraud attempts since 2022. The company even had a moment in the spotlight last year: It identified a fraudulent robocall impersonating former President Joe Biden’s voice that was used in New Hampshire to discourage Democrats from voting. Illustration by Cecilia Runxi Zhang for Forbes; Photos by Getty Images: LAW Ho Ming; Michael A. McCoy/Stringer Tesla’s stock surged despite the company posting some of its worst quarterly results in years this week, as Elon Musk said he would step back from his DOGE duties. But even if Musk becomes a more active CEO again, the problems the EV maker faces—like declining profit margins, intensifying competition and a tarnished brand image—aren’t going away anytime soon. Worse, it’s becoming clear Musk has run out of ideas for how to fix them, writes Forbes senior editor Alan Ohnsman. Just one hour after Forbes released an investigation into metaverse company Infinite Reality, which had previously announced a massive $3 billion fundraise from a single anonymous investor, the company revealed the investor’s identity. The company said the investment was “represented by” Sterling Select, a venture firm affiliated with Sterling Equities, whose cofounders are former principal owners of the New York Mets and prominent figures in the New York real estate industry—and known for their ties to Bernie Madoff. Sterling Equities’ general counsel denied any involvement with the funding round. NurPhoto via Getty Images The Chinese government may exempt some goods from its 125% tariff rate on all U.S. imports over reported concerns about the economic impact of the steep levies—imposed in response to Washington’s “reciprocal” tariffs. It would follow a similar carve out made by the Trump Administration earlier this month for certain items like Chinese-made smartphones and laptops. In a sign of the shifting cultural tides, 39% of companies said they would scale back on engagement for LGBTQ Pride Month this June, a survey from Gravity Research found. The executives surveyed from top companies cited conservative activists and President Donald Trump, who has waged a war on DEI and targeted the transgender community. Google CEO Sundar Pichai Google parent company Alphabet topped earnings expectations as it was the first of the trillion-dollar U.S. technology giants to report results from an uncertain first quarter. Google stock jumped about 4% in after-hours trading immediately following the release, and Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft are expected to report their earnings next week. The White House is reportedly considering a number of proposals to incentivize Americans to have children amid declining birth rates in the U.S., including a potential $5,000 “baby bonus.” When asked about the proposal, President Donald Trump called the bonus a “good idea,” though it would need to be approved by Congress. After President Donald Trump suggested it on Truth Social, the Trump Organization fired its ethics attorney, whom Harvard University hired to help with its lawsuit against the federal government. The Trump Organization began working with attorney William Burck in January to help prevent conflicts of interest between the company and Trump’s presidency, but the move to fire him raises questions about Trump’s independence from his business empire. ILLUSTRATION BY FORBES; IMAGES BY GOOGLE GEMINI AI Talk to any financial advisor these days, and he or she is likely to have a strong opinion about something known as “structured notes.” These complex products are sold as the “have your cake and eat it” investments of the wealth management world. Their specialty is flexibility—some are geared toward growth and others toward income. Returns are capped and in all cases the goal is to limit downside risk. They are manufactured by big banks like JPMorgan using derivatives, and are often sold as “stock market-linked” with “sleep well at night” protection. They come with maturities ranging from six months to five years, provide principal protection and sometimes offer annual yields of 10% or more. Up until the last few years, structured notes were mostly the domain of hedge funds and other sophisticated investors or ultra-wealthy clients. But thanks to clever engineering, the notes are now being offered by scores of brokers and sold in bite-sized $1,000 increments. The current market volatility and uncertainty has caused them to surge in popularity. Last year the broker-sold U.S. structured notes market reached a record high of nearly $150 billion, up 46% from the previous year, according to London’s Deriva Intelligence. JPMorgan was the top issuer in 2024, followed closely by the likes of Citi, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Barclays. WHY IT MATTERS "The surge in downside protection securities signals a proactive approach by both advisors and investors in response to today's market uncertainty,” says Forbes staff writer Sergei Klebnikov. “As these complex products which seek to limit losses become increasingly accessible, it's imperative that investors understand the nuances of different costs and risks involved."

(Photo by Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty Images) It offers better returns than your bank savings, ignores market crashes, and is tailored for the new economic landscape. Who are we referring to? It’s TransDigm Group (NYSE:TDG). Still overlooking it? We understand. It’s not an exciting tech name or a new AI superstar. It may seem dull. However, this is precisely the tactical error you should sidestep if you aim to grow your wealth. Evading significant fluctuations is crucial for wealth accumulation. The High-Quality portfolio, which aims to minimize volatility while providing compounding upside, has surpassed the S&P 500 and achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Let’s see if you still consider TDG stock unexciting after what we’ll share. You’ve heard enough about tech stocks that fluctuate like trapeze artists. But what if there exists a stock that offers tech-like returns without the chaotic movements? One that provides you with a 5.5% dividend– right now – and possesses the strength to increase that payout continuously? Introducing the defense stock that quietly exceeds expectations – TDG At 5.5%, this dividend outperforms most savings accounts, money markets, and even Treasuries. But here’s the catch – this dividend isn’t a “set-it-and-forget-it” yield. It has momentum behind it. What does this signify? This isn’t merely a dividend investment – it’s a cash-generating machine with growth potential. With healthy margins and swift revenue growth, dividends are set to increase as well. This implies that yields could rise or stay consistent as the stock price appreciates. Either way – you benefit! You enjoy growing income year after year. Many income stocks offer substantial dividends. Few provide them in conjunction with stability and capital appreciation. Contrast that with your favorite tech stocks. Nvidia: -62% in 2022, Meta: -75% drop from peak to trough, and Tesla – well, let’s not even discuss that. With this defense investment, you’re compounding quietly and steadily. And guess what – with its impressive margins, robust cash flow, and a DE ratio of 30%, this stock has considerable capacity to manage increased interest costs as debts are refinanced at higher yields in the coming years. This indicates that the risk to dividend growth is minimal. Think defense stocks are dull? Think again. Tariffs have returned. U.S.-China tensions are rising. The new industrial policy wave (whether called re-shoring, de-risking, or “Make America Build Again”) represents a favorable environment for defense expenses. Defense firms are not only safeguarded – they are positioned to prosper. And TDG has remained steadfast during market crises in the past. However, as the saying goes – never put all your eggs in one basket. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio is crafted to diversify stock-specific risks while providing access to potential growth. With a collection of 30 stocks, it has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the past 4 years. Why is that? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; experiencing less volatility, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / APRIL 25 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand.

President Donald Trump at the White House on April 22, 2025, in front of a painting depicting the aftermath of the assassination attempt last July in Butler, Pa. President Donald Trump sat down for an interview with TIME at the White House on April 22. Over the course of the interview, Trump discussed a wide range of issues, including his trade war and the economy, immigration, presidential power, and the situations in Ukraine and the Middle East. Below is a lightly edited transcript of the interview conducted by TIME Senior Political Correspondent Eric Cortellessa and Editor-in-Chief Sam Jacobs. Click here to read our fact check. Advertisement Advertisement TIME: Obviously, a lot has happened. We want to have a conversation about what your first 100 days have looked like in office. And we want to try to touch on as many different points as we can. Trump: There’s a lot, right? A lot of things happening. You know better than anyone that the President of the United States is the most powerful person in the world. At the same time, it seems like you are expanding the power of the presidency. Why do you think you need more power? Well, I don't feel I'm expanding it. I think I'm using it as it was meant to be used. I feel that we've had a very successful presidency in 100 days. We've had people writing it was the best first month and best second month, and really the best third month. But that you won't know about for a little while, because it takes a little time in transition. You know, we're resetting a table. We were losing $2 trillion a year on trade, and you can't do that. I mean, at some point somebody has to come along and stop it, because it's not sustainable. We were carrying other countries on our back with, you know, with trade numbers, with horrible numbers, and we've changed it. You see the market fluctuates quite a bit. Today, it's up 1,000 or 1,200 points. It goes up and down, but that will steady out, and we're taking in tremendous amounts of money. We have, as you know, already, 25% on cars, 25% on steel and aluminum— Mr. President, I think what we’re driving at is that you've taken congressional authority on trade and appropriations. You fired the heads of independent agencies. You're challenging the courts right now, as you know. You're using the levers of government to weaken private institutions like law firms and universities. Isn't this seizing power away from institutions and concentrating them inside the presidency? No, I think that what I'm doing is exactly what I've campaigned on. If you look at what I campaigned on, for instance, you can talk about removing people from the country. We have to do it because Biden allowed people to come in through his open border crazy, insanity. He allowed people to come into our country that we can't have in our country. Many criminals—they emptied their prisons, many countries, almost every country, but not a complete emptying, but some countries a complete emptying of their prison system. But you look all over the world, and I'm not just talking about South America, we're talking about all over the world. People have been led into our country that are very dangerous. If you were walking down the street, and if you happen to be near one of these people, they could, they would kill you, and they wouldn't even think about it. And we can't have that in our country. Buy a copy of TIME’s ‘Dealing With It’ issue here So you're not concentrating more power in the presidency? I don't think so. I think I'm using it properly, and I'm also using it as per my election. You know, everything that I'm doing—this is what I talked about doing. I said that I'm going to move the criminals out. I saw what was happening early on when I heard that he had open borders, when I, because it was a hard thing to believe. I built hundreds of miles of wall, and then he didn't want to, and we had another, an extra hundred miles that I could have put up because I ordered it as extra. I completed the wall, what I was doing, but we have, I wanted to build additional because it was working so well. An extension. And he didn't want to do that. And when he said he wasn't going to do that, I said, “Well, he must want open borders.” There were sections that were being built. And he stopped to work on it, and I said, this guy actually wants to have open borders. That's going to be a tragedy for our country. That's going to mean that other countries will release into our country some very rough people. We’d love to come back to immigration but maybe start with the economy. Obviously an issue you campaigned on as well. You promised that you would immediately bring down prices and usher in a golden age of America. The prices of gas and eggs have gone down, but the cost of other things remain— The prices of groceries have gone down. The only price that hasn't gone down is the price of energy. The cost of energy, I'm sorry, well, energy has gone down, excuse me. Let me change that—is the interest rates. And interest rates have essentially stayed the same. But almost every other thing, I mean, you take a look at what's going on, and this is, we're taking in billions of dollars of tariffs, by the way. And just to go back to the past, I took in hundreds of billions of dollars of tariffs from China, and then when COVID came, I couldn't institute the full program, but I took in hundreds of billions, and we had no inflation. But let’s focus on what is happening right now because— We took in billions of dollars, we had no inflation. Now, if you take a look, the price of groceries are down. The price of energy is down. Inflation remains pretty much the same. And the IMF is saying it’s going to go up. No, Eric, you can't say what they think, because so far what I thought is right. I've been right about— 401ks are down. The Atlanta Fed says our economy is contracting -2.2% during quarter one. Well, they may have said that, but so far, they've been, I mean, I've been right. If you look at all of the years that I've been doing this, I've been right on things. You're gonna—you're gonna have the wealthiest country we've ever had, and you're gonna have an explosion upward in the not-too-distant future. You know, I've been here now for three months, and I inherited eggs, I inherited groceries, I inherited energy. It was all going through the roof. And we had the highest inflation we've ever had as a country, or very close to it. And I believe it was the highest ever. Somebody said it's the highest in only 48 years. That's a lot, too, but I believe we had the highest inflation we've ever had. I've been here now for three months. And three months, we are taking in billions and billions of dollars from other countries that we never took in before. And that's just the start. Well let’s talk about the tariffs. You want companies to build and make goods here in America. Not in all cases. There are some products I really don't want to make here. Like t-shirts? I can’t–I can give you a list because I actually have a list, but if you want, I could give it to you. Well, I mean, the question is, how can CEOs make long-term plans and investments if our tariff policy can change from day to day and still remains so uncertain? How can they make long-term investments? I'll turn it around. How can they make long-term investments if our country is losing $2 trillion a year on trade? Will you consider giving exemptions— No wait, just so you understand. How can we sustain and how is it sustainable that our country lost almost $2 trillion on trade in Biden years, in this last year. That's not—when you talk about a company. I had the head of Walmart yesterday, right in that seat. I had the head of Walmart. I had the head of Home Depot and the head of Target in my office. And I'll tell you what they think, they think what I'm doing is exactly right. Well, the CEOs of small businesses are saying they may not be able to last another two months with the current regime in place. Will you consider giving small businesses an exemption similar to what you've given to Big Tech? I’d have to look at the individual business. Would you consider it? Our country is going to be very rich in not a long period of time. I've been doing this for three months, and if you look at the kind of numbers that we're taking in and the jobs, and if you look at, more importantly, the companies, the chip companies, the car companies, the Apple. $500 billion. Apple is investing $500 billion in building plants. They never invested in this country. Small businesses are worried that you’re treating the Apples of the world better than you’re treating them. No, I’m treating small businesses—small businesses will be a bigger beneficiary of what I'm doing than than the large businesses. But everybody's going to benefit. If we still have high tariffs, whether it's 20% or 30% or 50%, on foreign imports a year from now, will you consider that a victory? Total victory. Why so? Because the country will be making a fortune. Look, that's what China did to us. They charge us 100%. If you look at India—India charges 100-150%. If you look at Brazil, if you look at many, many countries, they charge—that's how they survive. That's how they got rich. Now, zero would be easy. Oh, zero would be easy, but zero, you wouldn't have any companies coming in. They're coming in because they don't want to pay the tariffs. Remember this, there are no tariffs, if they make their product here. There are no tariffs, if they make their product here. There are no tariffs. This is a tremendous success. You just don't know it yet, but this is a tremendous success what’s happening. We're taking in billions and billions of dollars, money that we never took in before. We're also, very importantly, because of that, because of the money we're taking in, those companies are going to come back and they're going to make their product here. They're going to go back into North Carolina and start making furniture again. They've already started. In Mexico, many car plants that were under construction have stopped. They're all coming into this country. We're gonna, you're gonna see car plants going at a level that you've never seen before. Your trade adviser– I'm also—chips. Look at Jensen. Nvidia. He's gonna spend $500 billion. Look at Mr. Wei from Taiwan. Do you trust them when they say that? These businessmen who say, Oh, I'm gonna spend $500 billion. Oh yeah. Well, I’ll tell you why I trust them. First of all, I think they’re trustworthy people. But more importantly, they have no choice, because they won't be able to pay the tariffs if they don't do it. The tariffs are bringing in the business. Remember, with all the, you know, questions you're asking about tariffs, there are no tariffs when you make your product here. Sure, no, I understand, Mr. President— Zero. Your trade adviser, Peter Navarro, says 90 deals in 90 days is possible. We're now 13 days into the point from when you lifted the reciprocal, the discounted reciprocal tariffs. There's zero deals so far. Why is that? No, there’s many deals. When are they going to be announced? You have to understand, I'm dealing with all the companies, very friendly countries. We're meeting with China. We're doing fine with everybody. But ultimately, I've made all the deals. Not one has been announced yet. When are you going to announce them? I’ve made 200 deals. You’ve made 200 deals? 100%. Can you share with whom? Because the deal is a deal that I choose. View it differently: We are a department store, and we set the price. I meet with the companies, and then I set a fair price, what I consider to be a fair price, and they can pay it, or they don't have to pay it. They don't have to do business with the United States, but I set a tariff on countries. Some have been horrible to us. Some have been okay. Nobody's been great. Nobody's been great. Everybody took advantage of us. What I'm doing is I will, at a certain point in the not too distant future, I will set a fair price of tariffs for different countries. These are countries—some of them have made hundreds of billions of dollars, and some of them have made just a lot of money. Very few of them have made nothing because the United States was being ripped off by every, almost every country in the world, in the entire world. So I will set a price, and when I set the price, and I will set it fairly according to the statistics, and according to everything else. For instance, do they have the VAT system in play? Do they charge us tariffs? How much are they charging us? How much have they been charging us? Many, many different factors, right. How are we being treated by that country? And then I will set a tariff. Are we paying for their military? You know, as an example, we have Korea. We pay billions of dollars for the military. Japan, billions for those and others. But that, I'm going to keep us a separate item, the paying of the military. Germany, we have 50,000 soldiers— I’m just curious, why don’t you announce these deals that you’ve solidified? I would say, over the next three to four weeks, and we're finished, by the way. You’re finished? We’ll be finished. Oh, you will be finished in three to four weeks. I’ll be finished. Now, some countries may come back and ask for an adjustment, and I'll consider that, but I'll basically be, with great knowledge, setting—ready? We're a department store, a giant department store, the biggest department store in history. Everybody wants to come in and take from us. They're going to come in and they're going to pay a price for taking our treasure, for taking our jobs, for doing all of these things. But what I'm doing with the tariffs is people are coming in, and they're building at levels you've never seen before. We have $7 trillion of new plants, factories and other things, investment coming into the United States. And if you look back at past presidents, nobody was anywhere near that. And this is in three months. Will you call President Xi if he doesn’t call you? No. You won’t? Nope. Has he called you yet? Yep. When did he call you? He's called. And I don't think that's a sign of weakness on his behalf. But you would think it’s a sign of weakness if you called him? I don’t–I just look— Well, what did he say? If people want to–well, we all want to make deals. But I am this giant store. It's a giant, beautiful store, and everybody wants to go shopping there. And on behalf of the American people, I own the store, and I set prices, and I'll say, if you want to shop here, this is what you have to pay. This period of uncertainty will be over in three to four weeks? I don’t think there’s any uncertainty there. The only thing—they have an option. They don't have to shop here. They can go someplace else, but there aren't too many places they can go. You understand what I mean though? Sure. Your Treasury Secretary says this situation with China is unsustainable. Oh I agree. You mean the way it is now? Yes. Or the way it was before I got here? The current moment, too, he believes is unsustainable. Well, no, they won’t do any business here, because at 145% it's going to be very rare that you see business. But your conversations with Xi have made you feel like we’re moving towards a more productive— Oh, there’s a number at which they will feel comfortable. Yeah. But you can’t let them make a trillion dollars from us. You can’t let them make $750 billion. See, that’s really what’s not sustainable when China makes a trillion dollars, or a trillion one, when we have almost $2 trillion worth of, I call it loss. Some people don't, but a lot of it’s loss. I say, when you have a trade deficit of $2 trillion I consider that loss. Mr. President, there was a period of time on April 9 when the bond market was under extreme stress and there was a risk of a financial crisis far beyond what the plummeting stock market suggested. I wasn’t worried. What did your advisers tell you, though? You were in the Oval Office with Scott Bessent and Howard Lutnick. What did they tell you to convince you to lift the reciprocal tariffs for the 90-day pause? They didn’t tell me. I did that. What made you decide? It wasn’t for that reason. It wasn’t for the bond market? No, it wasn’t for that reason. I'm doing that until we come up with the numbers that I want to come up with. I've met with a lot of countries. I've talked on the telephone. I don’t even want them to come in. You said the bond market was getting the yips. The bond market was getting the yips, but I wasn’t. Because I know what we have. I know what we have, but I also know we won't have it for long if we allowed four more years of the gross incompetence. This thing was just running—it was running as a free spirit. This was—this was the most incompetent president in history. In our interview last year, Mr. President, you committed to complying with all Supreme Court orders. I said what? You committed to complying with all Supreme Court orders— Yeah. When you and I spoke last April. Are you still committed to complying with all Supreme Court orders? Sure, I believe in the court system. The Supreme Court ruled 9-0 that you have to bring back Kilmar Abrego Garcia. You haven't done so. Aren’t you disobeying the Supreme Court? Well, that’s not what my people told me—they didn’t say it was, they said it was—the nine to nothing was something entirely different. Let me quote from the ruling. “The order properly requires the government to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador.” Are you facilitating a release? I leave that to my lawyers. I give them no instructions. They feel that the order said something very much different from what you're saying. But I leave that to my lawyers. If they want—and that would be the Attorney General of the United States and the people that represent the country. I don't make that decision. Have you asked President Bukele to return him? I haven’t, uh, he said he wouldn’t. Did you ask him? But I haven’t asked him positively, but he said he wouldn’t. But if you haven't asked him, then how are you facilitating his release? Well, because I haven't been asked to ask him by my attorneys. Nobody asked me to ask him that question, except you. Do you believe he deserves his day in court? I believe that they made him look like a saint, and then we found out about him. He wasn't a saint. He was MS-13. He was a wife beater and he had a lot of things that were very bad, you know, very, very bad. When I first heard of the situation, I was not happy, and then I found out that he was a person who was an MS-13 member. And in fact, he had a tattooed right on his—I'm sure you saw that—he had it tattooed right on his knuckles: MS-13. No, I believe he's a man who has got quite a past. This is no longer just a nice, wonderful man from Maryland, which people, which the fake news had me and other people for a period of time believing. Now, nobody believes that. And I think this isa very bad—I think this is another menwomen’s sports thing for the Democrats. Maybe, but Mr. President, whatever he might have done, whoever he might be affiliated with, doesn’t he deserve his day in court? Nazi saboteurs who came on our shores at Montauk during World War II had their day in court. Al Qaeda terrorists had their day in court. I really give that to my lawyers to determine, that’s why I have them. That’s not my determination. It's something that, frankly, bringing him back and retrying him wouldn't bother me, but I leave that up to my lawyer. You could bring him back and retry him— That’s exactly right. You could fix this simply by bringing him back and going through the legal process— But I leave that decision to the lawyers. At this moment, they just don’t want to do that. They say we’re in total compliance with the Supreme Court. What about the lower courts? Are you committed to complying with lower courts? Sure. All courts. One more question on this, sir. You took an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. The Constitution says the Supreme Court is the ultimate authority once they issue a ruling. If you defy them, aren't you violating your oath? I'm not defying the Supreme Court. I never defy the Supreme Court. I wouldn't do that. I'm a big believer in the Supreme Court, and have a lot of respect for the Justices. You asked President Bukele of El Salvador to build out the CECOT prison to house American citizens. You said you would love to send “homegrown criminals” there— No, I didn’t say that. I said if it were permissible according to the law, I would like to do that, yes. Well, do you intend to send American citizens to foreign persons? I would love to do that if it were permissible by law. We're looking into that. When I have a person, these would be extreme cases. When I have a person that is a 28-time in and out person that goes out and tries to kill people every time he or she is out, I would have no problem with doing that whatsoever. We're talking about career criminals that are horrible people that we house and we have to take care of for 50 years while they suffer because they killed people. If you ask me whether or not I would do that, I would, but totally, and I think you have to leave this part of the sentence totally subject to it being allowed under law. And people are looking to see if it would be allowed under law. We have crime rates under Biden that went through the roof, and we have to bring those rates down. And unfortunately, those rates have been added to by the illegal immigrants that he allowed into the country. Which Americans would you do that to? I would do that to people that hit old ladies over the head with a baseball bat, for people that grab their bicycle? You saw that one where they dragged an old woman along the street on a motorcycle, a bicycle, a motorcycle, I think. People that push people into subway trains just before the train is ready to stop. You saw that? The man barely lived. Think of it. And a guy comes up to him, and from behind he pushes him. That's a serious, serious thing. People that shoot people in the back, people that are executioners. Yeah, I would have no trouble with that but subject to it being allowed by law. Do you really want there to be gulags for American citizens in foreign countries? Gulag? You define gulag. Prisons like in the Soviet Union— Look, I see where you’re coming from, from the moment this interview started, and it's fine, I don't mind. I've answered every question that can be answered by mankind or womankind, and I see where you're coming from. Rapid fire. You can't even wait for me to give you the answer. You should let me give you that final answer. Go ahead, sir. No, no, I’m not—I’m just saying, I see where you’re coming from, and you’re just so wrong. You’re so wrong. These are people that have been in jail for 20 times. They're career criminals. Do I have a problem with a career criminal that hits people with baseball bats when they're not looking, that pushes people into subways, that shoots people in the face or in the back? I have absolutely no problem with doing that, if the law allows it to be done and we're looking at it. And one of the reasons I like it is because it would be much less expensive than our prison system, and I think it would actually be a greater deterrent. Sir, on that note, how much are we paying President Bukele for holding those prisoners? I don’t know. I could get you the information, but we’re paying less than we would normally. Did you personally approve those payments? No, I didn’t. Many of the Jan. 6 prisoners you pardoned pleaded guilty to or were convicted of violent crimes as part of the capital attack. Days before you pardoned them, J.D. Vance said “of course” you wouldn't include those who committed violence. What changed? What changed where? At what moment did you decide to include all of the defendants, including the ones who committed violent offenses? Because I've watched in Portland and I watched in Seattle, and I've watched in Minneapolis, Minnesota and other places. People do heinous acts, far more serious than what took place on Jan. 6. And nothing happened to these people. Nothing. And I said, What a double standard it is. And we were talking about a very small group of people that are in your definition, most of these people should have been let out a long time ago. There's never been a group of people, maybe with one exception, I won't even go into it, one exception as a group. But there's never been a group of people that's been treated so horribly as the J6 people. You know, when I say peacefully and patriotically, nobody mentions that. When I say go peacefully and patriotically, nobody ever mentions that. Nobody mentions the fact that the unselect committee of political scum, the unselect committee, horrible people, they destroyed all evidence, they burned it, they got rid of it, they destroyed it, and they deleted all evidence. And we went in looking for evidence, and they said, I'm sorry, we don't have it anymore. It's been destroyed. If I ever did that, it would be unthinkable what you guys, what you two guys, would be doing and writing, but, you know, and nobody wants to talk about it, and you won't write about it, and nobody writes about it. It’s unbelievable, right? But people get it. I mean, people get it. They get what I'm saying, and they obviously believe it, because I had a hell of an election. You campaigned on it, and you won decisively. No and everything I campaigned. If you think of, you know, the way you ask me these questions, like, it's so serious that we're moving people out of the country. I said during the election that I'm going to move them out of the country, and that's what we're doing. Can you talk a little bit about the budget? Yeah. And if we didn't do it, then you two would not be safe. I guarantee it. Some Republicans are considering raising taxes on millionaires in the package you're planning to pass that would extend your 2017 tax cuts. Do you support that idea? Well, I’ll tell ya, I certainly don’t mind having a tax increase, and the only reason I wouldn't support it is because I saw Bush where they said, where he said “Read my lips” and he lost an election. He would have lost it anyway, but he lost an election. He got beat up pretty good. I would be honored to pay more, but I don't want to be in a position where we lose an election because I was generous, but me, as a rich person, would not mind paying and you know, we're talking about very little. We're talking about one point. It doesn't make that much difference, and yet, I could just see somebody trying to bring that up as a subject, and, you know, say, “Oh, he raised taxes.” Well, I wouldn't be, really, you know, in the true sense, I wouldn't. I'd be raising them on wealthy to take care of middle class. And that's—I love, that. I actually love the concept, but I don't want it to be used against me politically, because I've seen people lose elections for less, especially with the fake news. Do you think it would help cover the cost that would be lost from getting rid of taxes on tips and some of these other proposals? Well, that would be able to take it. See, that would be able to do it, but I would not mind personally paying more. But the concept is something that may not be acceptable to the public. Experts estimate that the House Republican budget will result in more than $800 billion in losses to Medicaid over the next 10 years. Do you support that? Due to what? The House Republican budget that would cut roughly $800 billion from Medicaid. I don’t think they’re going to cut $800 billion. They’re going to look at waste, fraud, and abuse. So would you veto a bill if it had cuts to Medicaid? If it was an increase, if we were deducting something from—I would, but it's waste, it's fraud and abuse is what we're looking for. And nobody minds that. If Republicans send you a bill that cuts Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, you commit to vetoing it? If it cuts it, I would not approve. So you would veto that? I would veto it, yeah. But they’re not going to do that. Would you support a ban on congressional stock trading? Well, I watched Nancy Pelosi get rich through insider information, and I would be okay with it. If they send that to me, I would do it. You'll sign it? Absolutely. The FTC is currently trying Meta for maintaining an illegal monopoly by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. Do you think more companies need to be broken up? It depends on the company, depends on the market, depends on what the company does. But I think that a lot of companies certainly have been looked at during the Obama and during the Biden regime certainly. Do you think corporate monopolies have hurt average Americans? In some cases, yeah. In some cases, not. I’d like to ask you some questions about DOGE. You've put Elon Musk in charge of this cost-cutting operation. The question is, why is the government, through DOGE, amassing the sensitive personal information about everyday Americans, which was previously stored across different agencies, all in one place? DOGE has been a very big success. We found hundreds of billions of dollars of waste, fraud, and abuse. Billions of dollars being given to politicians, single politicians based on the environment. It's a scam. It's illegal, in my opinion, so much of the stuff that we found, but I think DOGE has been a big success from that standpoint. [An aide interrupts the interview for President Trump to take a phone call from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi] So if we can just come back to the question before the call, which is the database that DOGE is putting together Americans’ information. Why are they doing that? Because we want to find waste, fraud, and abuse, and want to cut our costs. Some officials have described what DOGE is doing is creating a central kind of “God-mode” view into government databases that has been, up until now, intentionally kept separate. The idea, they say, is to basically use this information to advance your policy goals. Is this an accurate characterization? No, that’s inaccurate, as you know. I mean, it’s a crazy question. We just want to find fraud, abuse. We want to find who's on the rolls that shouldn't be, who's getting paid every month by the government that shouldn't be paid. Do these people exist? In many cases, they don't, in some cases, even worse, they do. They've been getting money, and they shouldn't be. What does your administration plan to do with information obtained by the IRS and other agencies as part of the DOGE effort? Well, I don’t know about the IRS, because, as you know, I’m not involved in it, but we’ve found tremendous waste, fraud and abuse. Tremendous. Will any of it be used to track down and round up migrants as part of the deportation operation? Not that I know of, no. Let's talk about the cuts. As you know, Mr. President, a lot of American companies do business with the government. The DOGE cuts aren't just affecting government employees. They're also affecting American businesses that provide goods and services to the federal government. There were nearly 280,000 layoffs in March across virtually every sector. Why is it better for these people to be out of jobs? Because we have to have an efficient country. And when the country gets down to bare knuckles, you're going to see, you're going to see something the likes of which this world has never seen before. We're going to make our country strong, powerful, and very rich again. Right now, our country is not sustainable. We're being ripped off by everybody in the world, other countries, other people, other militaries, are ripping us off. We're protecting countries for no money or for very minimal money, and that wasn't supposed to happen. We're not supposed to be protecting everybody. We're supposed to be, number one, taking care of ourself, and number two, helping people when we can, helping outside people and outside countries where we can. But we've been ripped off by levels that you've never seen. European Union sounds nice, but they've been very tough. $300 billion loss. China—hundreds of billions of dollars in losses. And I can go through a list, but I don't want to, because there are many friendly countries, our friendly countries, in many cases, are worse than our enemies. And it's not a sustainable model. It's not a sustainable possibility even, that a country can go through that and Biden let it get to a level that is seriously dangerous. Well, many Americans certainly agree with you that they want to get rid of government fraud, waste, and abuse. They want to shrink the federal— It’s not only government. It’s deals. It's horrible deals that have been made with other countries. As an example, China has been ripping us off for many years, until I came along. I raised, I upped tariffs on China, hundreds of billions of dollars. We've done hundreds of billions, hundreds. But domestically, for instance, your administration blocked grants for the National Institutes of Health that funded research into infectious diseases, cancers, Alzheimer's— Well maybe we didn't think they were right. You know, I mean, you look at the people, look at the money that was given away by others. We didn't get anything out of it. Well what do you tell the families and people who are suffering from those diseases? We're taking care of—we're spending a lot. I spent 58—we spent, let's see, I think $58 billion in the first term. We were spending tremendous amounts of money, and I am now, but they have to be a little bit careful. A lot of the money like Stacey Abrams got $2 billion on the environment. They had $100 in the account and she got $2 billion just before these people left—and had to do with something that she knows nothing about. NIH is the world’s largest funder of cancer research— Shouldn’t they be asking those questions? I could give you a list of abuse and waste and fraud, and you don't have any interest in hearing it. I mean, I just see by these questions, just wondering, with all of the bad things that have happened, with all of the things we found, you have no interest in those things. You only have an interest. So what about this? What about that? Our country is going to be strong again because of what we're doing, and this is not a sustainable model, what we're looking at. And I think very importantly, I had a great election. Won all seven swing states, won millions and millions of votes. Won millions of votes. They say it was the most consequential election in 129 years. I don't know if that's right, but it was certainly a big win, and that's despite cheating that took place, by the way, because there was plenty of cheating that took place. In ‘24? ‘24, yeah. ‘20, of course. But ‘24 also, they tried. They tried that. They did their best. It's the only thing they're good at. But we're gonna have a great country again. Just remember, every single question you're asking, I campaigned on it. I campaigned on all the things you're talking about, all the things you're asking about, and openly campaigned. And we're given credit, even by radical left lunatics. We are given credit for that. We're given credit for saying, This is what I'm going to do. If you look at your questions, that's what I campaigned on. Following that call, I'd love to hear a little bit about the role that you're playing on the world stage. And I think that you campaigned on that too. It’s interesting because you see the relationship. I didn't want to wait, you know, have you leave the room, but you see the relationship. I have that relationship with many leaders. If I can stop losing 3,000 human beings a week on average, with Russia, Ukraine, it's only because of me, nobody else could have stopped it. I think we're going to do that, by the way. I think that'll be done. I think that we're going to make a deal with Iran. I think we're going to make a deal with Iran. Nobody else could do that. You said you would end the war in Ukraine on Day One. Well, I said that figuratively, and I said that as an exaggeration, because to make a point, and you know, it gets, of course, by the fake news [unintelligible]. Obviously, people know that when I said that, it was said in jest, but it was also said that it will be ended. Well what’s taking so long? When do you think it will be ended? Well, I don’t think it’s long. I mean, look, I got here three months ago. This war has been going on for three years. It's a war that would have never happened if I was president. It's Biden's war. It’s not my war. I have nothing to do with it. I would have never had this war. This war would have never happened. Putin would have never done it. This war would have never happened. Oct. 6 would have never happened. Oct. 7 would have never happened. Would have never happened. Ever. You then say, what’s taking so long? Do you hear this, Steve? The war has been raging for three years. I just got here, and you say, what's taken so long? Do you think peace is still possible if Putin is President? I think peace is possible. You say if Putin is still president? Yeah, if Putin is President. Can there be peace if Putin is President of Russia? I think with me as president, there's—possible, if very probable. If somebody else is president, no chance. If Putin can make peace? Yeah, I think Putin will. I think Putin would rather do it a different way. I think he’d rather go and take the whole thing. And I think that because of me, I believe I'm the only one that can get this thing negotiated. And I think we’re a long way. We've had very good talks, and we're getting very close to a deal. And I don't believe anybody else could have made that deal. Do you believe peace is possible if Zelensky is still President of Ukraine? Yeah, I do. He is president now and I think we’re going to make a deal. Should Ukraine give up any hope of ever joining NATO? I don’t think they’ll ever be able to join NATO. I think that's been—from day one, I think that's been, that's I think what caused the war to start was when they started talking about joining NATO. If that weren't brought up, there would have been a much better chance that it wouldn’t have started. Should Crimea go to the Russians? Should they get to keep Crimea? Well, Crimea went to the Russians. It was handed to them by Barack Hussein Obama, and not by me. With that being said, will they be able to get it back? They've had their Russians. They've had their submarines there for long before any period that we're talking about, for many years. The people speak largely Russian in Crimea. But this was given by Obama. This wasn't given by Trump. Would it have been taken from me like it was taken from Obama? No, it wouldn't have happened. Crimea, if I were president, it would not have been taken. Would it be acceptable to you in a deal if Crimea and the four other regions that Russia has taken from Ukraine would be folded into Russia under a final accommodation? If Crimea will stay with Russia—we have to only talk about Crimea because that's the one that always gets mentioned. Crimea will stay with Russia. And Zelensky understands that, and everybody understands that it's been with them for a long time. It's been with them long before Trump came along. Again, this is Obama's war. This is a war that should have never happened. I call it the war that should have never happened. You’ve talked about improving relations with Moscow. Are you pursuing negotiations with them on issues other than Ukraine? No— Like nuclear weapons stockpiles or testing? But if a deal has happened, I can see us doing business with Ukraine and with Russia as a country. You've talked about acquiring Greenland, taking control of the Panama Canal, making Canada the 51st state. Maybe you're trolling a little bit on that one. I don't know. Actually, no, I’m not. Well, do you want to grow the American empire? Well, it depends as an empire, it wasn't, these are not things that we had before, so I'd view it a little bit differently if we had the right opportunity. Yeah, I think Greenland would be very well off if they I think it's important for us for national security and even international security. I think Canada, what you said that, “Well, that one, I might be trolling.” But I'm really not trolling. Canada is an interesting case. We lose $200 to $250 billion a year supporting Canada. And I asked a man who I called Governor Trudeau. I said, ”Why? Why do you think we're losing so much money supporting you? Do you think that's right? Do you think that's appropriate for another country to make it possible, for a country to sustain and he was unable to give me an answer, but it costs us over $200 billion a year to take care of Canada?” We’re taking care of their military. We're taking care of every aspect of their lives, and we don't need them to make cars for us. In fact, we don't want them to make cars for us. We want to make our own cars. We don't need their lumber. We don't need their energy. We don't need anything from Canada. And I say the only way this thing really works is for Canada to become a state. Steven Cheung: We’re coming up on time, about 10 minutes. Okay, we'll move quickly then. Last note: Do you want to be remembered as a president who expanded American territory? Wouldn’t mind. One more question on the cuts, sir. You've made cuts to homeland security, cyber defenses, the Nuclear Security Administration, your FBI chief is pushing to shift the bureau from domestic intelligence to criminal investigation. These are programs that were set up after September 11 to prevent terrorist attacks. Are you worried that this could be making America more vulnerable to an attack? No. America will be much stronger. If we are attacked, do you risk being blamed for letting down our defenses? What does that mean? If we are subject to an attack, do you risk being blamed because of these cuts? I think I'll be blamed no matter what. I think if I make the country unbelievably successful, which it's not now, we owe $36 trillion right? It's, you know, when you think about it, a lot of money, a lot of money, but, but no, I think I'll be, I'll be blamed whether it's successful or not. I'm used to it. You may be right about that. UNICEF says that more than 300 children have been killed and more than 600 have been wounded since the ceasefire in Gaza broke down. Who is to blame for those deaths? I would say that the blame for that is Biden more than anybody else, because I had, as you know, Iran was broke, and he allowed them to become rich— More than Hamas? There was no money for Hamas. There was no money for Hezbollah. There was no money. Iran was broke under Trump, and you know that, he knows that, broke. They had no money, and they told Hamas, we're not giving you any money. When Biden came and he took off all the sanctions, he let China and everybody else buy all the oil, Iran developed $300 billion in cash over a four year period. They started funding terror again, including Hamas. Hamas was out of business. Hezbollah was out of business. Iran had no money under me. I blame the Biden administration, because they allowed Iran to get back into the game without working a deal. You’ve begun direct talks with Iran. Are you open to meeting with Iran’s President or Supreme Leader? Sure. You reportedly stopped Israel from attacking Iran's nuclear sites. That's not right. It’s not right? No, it’s not right. I didn’t stop them. But I didn't make it comfortable for them, because I think we can make a deal without the attack. I hope we can. It's possible we'll have to attack because Iran will not have a nuclear weapon. But I didn't make it comfortable for them, but I didn't say no. Ultimately I was going to leave that choice to them, but I said I would much prefer a deal than bombs being dropped. Are you worried Netanyahu will drag you into a war? No. Let’s talk about some of the issues with universities— By the way, he may go into a war. But we’re not getting dragged in. The U.S. will stay out of it if Israel goes into it? No, I didn’t say that. You asked if he’d drag me in, like I’d go in unwillingly. No, I may go in very willingly if we can't get a deal. If we don't make a deal, I'll be leading the pack. You're planning your first major foreign trip for your second term to the Middle East next month. What are the last hurdles for Saudi Israeli normalization? Well, what I want, and the reason I'm doing it, is because Saudi Arabia, I happen to like the people very much, and the Crown Prince and the King—I like all of them, but they've agreed to invest a trillion dollars in our economy. $1 trillion. I'm then going to Qatar, and I'm then going to UAE, and then I'm coming back, and then we're making another. I think our foreign policy has been incredible, and it was before, and it is now. You sort of got a little glimpse of it. Are you closer to a Saudi-Israeli normalization deal than you were before? I have very good relationships in the Middle East, and I think all over the world. I think it's—well, the smarter people understand. I have stopped—I have solved more problems in the world without asking for or getting credit. This would be a big one. Which one? Saudi-Israeli normalization. You had the Abraham Accords, one of your, you know, historic accomplishments— Unfortunately, they did nothing. They did nothing with the Abraham Accords. We had four countries in there, it was all set. We would have had it packed. Now we're going to start it again. The Abraham Accords is a tremendous success, but Biden just sat with it. Can you build on it to get the Saudi-Israeli normalization deal? Well, I tell you what: I think Saudi Arabia will go into the Abraham Accords. Yeah? Yeah, and by the way, I think it will be full very quickly. It would be a big deal if that happens. They did nothing. Oh, that will happen. That would be a big accomplishment. The State Department said it has revoked 300 student visas, primarily because of their participation in campus protests. I want to ask you about this, Mr. President, because you emphasized free speech as a cornerstone of your campaign, you castigated efforts to suppress it. But now it looks like your administration is deporting hundreds of people for engaging in speech you don't like. Why? Tremendous anti-semitism at every one of those rallies. Tremendous, and I agree with free speech, but not riots all over every college in America. Tremendous anti-semitism going on in this country. Are you worried that you're intimidating students or chilling free speech on American campuses and elsewhere throughout the country? No, they can protest, but they can't destroy the schools like they did with Columbia and others. Let’s talk about one case. Are you familiar with the case of the Tufts University student Reynessa Ozturk, who was arrested by a group of plain clothes officers. Well, she has since been accused by your government of having ties to Hamas. They have not revealed any evidence. Would you direct your Department of Justice to disclose the evidence that she is connected to Hamas? I would have no trouble with it, no. I’ll look into it, but I’m not aware of the particular event. You were harshly critical of what you called the weaponization of the Justice System under Biden. You recently signed memos— Well, sure, but you wouldn’t be—if this were Biden, well, first of all, he wouldn't do an interview because he was grossly incompetent. We spoke to him last year, Mr. President. Huh? We spoke to him a year ago. How did he do? You can read the interview yourself. Not too good. I did read the interview. He didn't do well. He didn't do well at all. He didn't do well at anything. And he cut that interview off to being a matter of minutes, and you weren't asking him questions like you're asking me. Well, we appreciate that you are able and willing to answer these questions. It says something about you, Mr. President. I am indeed. I've been answering them for years and I’ve been getting elected by bigger and bigger numbers all the time, but you didn't ask questions like this to Biden, because if you did, he would have crawled under this beautiful desk. You recently signed memos calling for an investigation of Chris Krebs, a top cybersecurity official in your first term. Isn't that, though, what you accused Biden of doing to you? I think Chris Krebs was a disgrace to our country. I think he was—I think he was terrible. By the way, I don't know him. I'm not—I don't think I ever met him. I probably saw him around. You know, I have people come in, like the other one. He came in, and he's on CNN all the time as like an expert on Trump. I have no idea who he is. And Chris Krebs the same thing. I guess he probably said he knows me, but I have no idea. And you know, oftentimes I'll have some people sitting right here, and behind them will be 10 or 15 people from their agency or their office, and they'll stand there, and then all of a sudden, I'll hear that like I'm, you know, they're all time experts in me. I know very little about Chris Krebs, but I think he was very deficient. You've used threats and lawsuits, other forms of coercion— Well, I’ve gotta be doing something right, because I've had a lot of law firms give me a lot of money. Why is that an appropriate use of presidential power? Well, I think it is because I think they felt that the election was rigged and stolen and they didn't want to be a part of it. You think they gave me $100 million each for nothing? You know these law firms gave me $100 million worth of work, et cetera, and other things. And do you think they gave me that because I'm a nice guy? I don't think so. They gave it to me because they knew what they did wrong and they didn't want to get involved with it. And that's okay. That's the way it works, unfortunately. But that is an appropriate use of presidential power, you think? Which is? The threats and the EOs against the law firms. They pay–these are the top firms in the world. These are the biggest, the best: Cravath, Milbank Tweed, Paul Weiss. These are the toughest, smartest firms. They don't, they don't do this unless there's a little problem or a big problem. Isn't cutting a deal with them to remove a threat from you and to do pro-bono work for causes you like just a form of extortion? I don’t think it was a threat. I think they did that because, I assume they did it because they felt they did something wrong. Otherwise they would have, we would have had a lawsuit. You once said you weren't sure how the Civil Rights Act quote “worked out.” Would America be better without it? I never heard of that. Nobody’s ever asked me that before. You said it in a 2020 interview. I don't remember having said that. Cheung: We have time for one more question. When we spoke to you a year ago, we asked whether you would challenge the 22nd Amendment, which limits presidents to two terms. You said, and I quote, “I'm going to serve one term. I'm going to do a great job, and I'm going to leave.” What changed? Well, I’m serving two terms now. You meant one in addition to the one you already served. You mean one more. I have more people begging me to run again, but I haven't looked at even the possibility. But the only thing that's changed is they think I'm doing a great job, and they like the way I'm running the country. They have a border, which you didn't ask about, that's virtually totally closed. The best border we've ever had. Border crossings are down substantially. No, I mean, it's, it's really, people can't believe it. They interviewed some farmers, really beautiful people that lived on the other side. They were being drawn into fights and horror shows, and now, I mean, it was dangerous. One of them got very badly injured, and by an illegal migrant that came across. And they asked him, How is it now? He said, ”Thank God for Donald Trump. It's the best it's ever been. And I've lived here for 50 years.” You recently said you were “not joking” about seeking a third term and that there were methods to do it. What methods? I'd rather not discuss that now, but as you know, there are some loopholes that have been discussed that are well known. But I don't believe in loopholes. I don't believe in using loopholes. You wouldn’t run as vice president to J.D. Vance? I don’t know anything about, what, look, all I can say is this, I am being inundated with requests. I'm doing a good job. Great physical exam, and unlike every other president, I took the cognitive test and I aced it 100% and I bet you guys couldn't get 100% on that exam. It's a tough exam. You know, when you get into the mid questions, it gets to be pretty tricky and pretty tough, and the last questions are very tough, and I aced it. And I guarantee, I'd give you, I'd make a big, beautiful bet that you guys couldn't ace it. But anyway. But look, it's good to have you, it’s a very nasty interview. They don’t ask any of the good things. One final question. Mr. President, you were showing us the new paintings you have behind us. You put all these new portraits. One of them includes John Adams. John Adams said we’re a government ruled by laws, not by men. Do you agree with that? John Adams said that? Where was the painting? It’s right here. We’re a government ruled by laws, not by men? Well, I think we're a government ruled by law, but you know, somebody has to administer the law. So therefore men, certainly, men and women, certainly play a role in it. I wouldn't agree with it 100%. We are a government where men are involved in the process of law, and ideally, you're going to have honest men like me. Thank you, Mr. President.

Title: Google Earnings Stock Soars As Q1 Results Shatter Expectations

Google parent Alphabet reported first-quarter earnings Thursday afternoon, becoming the first of the trillion-dollar U.S. technology behemoths to report earnings from the first quarter, a period marred by elevated economic uncertainty that could weigh on the advertising-heavy Google. Valuing Google might be the "closest thing to impossible" with significant macroeconomic and ... More regulatory uncertainty, shrugged one Wall Street analyst. Alphabet brought in $90.2 billion of revenue in Q1, topping consensus analyst estimates of $89.2 billion, and $2.81 diluted earnings per share ($34.5 billion net income), smashing forecasts of $2.01 EPS ($24.8 billion net income), according to FactSet. That equates to 12% top line expansion from Q1 2024 and 49% bottom line growth year-over-year. Alphabet’s bread-and-butter Google search unit generated $50.7 billion in sales, compared to forecasts of $50.5 billion, and its artificial intelligence-heavy Google cloud brought in $12.3 billion, matching projections of $12.3 billion. Google stock jumped about 5% in after-hours trading immediately following the release, and its $169 afternoon share price has the tech firm on track to open at its highest level in four weeks. The company also announced Thursday board authorization for a $70 billion stock buyback program, and it will increase its quarterly cash dividend by 5% to $0.21. In the earnings call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai declined to “speculate about potential impacts” of tariffs, before adding the rollback of the de minimis tariff exemptions will “obviously cause a slight headwind to our ads business in 2025, primarily from” Asian retailers. Google is grappling with a “negative tariff ad spend impact,” according to Bank of America analyst Justin Post, specifically noting declining spending from Chinese discount retailers Temu and Shein as Trump’s more than 100% tariffs on Chinese imports stifle the flow of goods from the country to U.S. consumers. Still, Google has “relatively less” pressure from the choppy operating environment, according to Post. About 4% to 5% of Google’s revenues come from Chinese companies spending on U.S. advertising, according to Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik, much less than the 7% to 8% exposure from Google’s top digital advertising rival, Facebook parent Meta. Shares of Google rose during Thursday’s regular session ahead of the release, gaining more than 2% to $161, the highest level in two weeks. The bounce came as stocks continued to rally on renewed hopes President Donald Trump would keep backing down from his most aggressive tariff plans, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index rose nearly 3% on Thursday, heading to its third consecutive day of an at least 2% rally. That’s the first time the Nasdaq has risen by that much in three straight trading sessions since 2001, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Still, Google stock is down 16% year-to-date, slightly worse than the tech-heavy Nasdaq’s 12% decline as fears of an economic slowdown tied to Trump’s trade war broadly ate into investor confidence. “If investing in US tech stocks was difficult right now, underwriting Google might be the closest thing to impossible,” Shmulik wrote Wednesday. Among the massive unknowns swirling around Google are recession concerns, tariff exposure, potential for generative AI to disrupt online search, a “library of regulatory overhangs” and a “potential lightning rod for international retaliation” against American entities, explained Shmulik. Among the “library” of regulatory hurdles facing Google include high-profile monopoly probes from U.S. prosecutors. A federal judge ruled last week Google maintains an illegal monopoly in advertising technology, and the Justice Department argued in an ongoing antitrust case the company should be forced to sell its Chrome web browser. Google is one of the six West Coast tech companies with market values of at least $1 trillion, joined by Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon and Meta (those companies are often lumped together with Elon Musk’s Tesla to form the “magnificent seven”). Google was a key part of the massive tech stock rally as generative AI’s popularity spiked, as its share price more than doubled from the end of 2022 to 2024. But big tech has stalled on Wall Street as recession fears escalated, as Bloomberg’s magnificent seven index has declined about 20% in 2025. Next week, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft will all report earnings from 2025’s first three months. Tesla, the least valuable member of the magnificent seven, shared its Q1 report Tuesday, missing on both profit and revenue forecasts. One Community. Many Voices.
