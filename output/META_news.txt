Black Friday is one of the biggest sales events of the year. Last year, Shopify merchants drove a record-breaking $11.5 billion in sales during the Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) weekend. With so many consumers open to shopping during the holiday weekend, leaning on tried and tested marketing channels can open the floodgates to more revenue in the fourth quarter. For many retailers, that‚Äôs email marketing. Email is the third-most influential channel on holiday purchase decisions, beating influencer endorsements, in-person experiences, and conversations with retail associates in-store. But when so many retailers rely on this direct line of communication to promote holiday sales, it‚Äôs difficult to stand out in a subscriber‚Äôs crowded inbox. This guide shares innovative Black Friday email marketing strategies to try this year, with best practices and examples from leading retailers. Customer data is the most valuable asset any ecommerce business has. It allows you to tailor email outreach and deliver on customers‚Äô expectations for a personalized shopping experience. Yet 85% of internet users want to do more to protect their online privacy, meaning this strategy can be difficult to implement. Before the holiday season arrives, take stock of the customer data you currently have. If your email list is small or you don‚Äôt have supplementary information to personalize campaigns to existing subscribers, deploy lead generation campaigns to gather more holiday season customer data. For example: Because Shopify offers a customer data platform (CDP) by default, any first-party data you‚Äôve collected on your customers gets combined in a unified customer profile. Whenever they share their email address or phone number, this data‚Äîsuch as their order history, loyalty points they‚Äôve earned, previous emails they‚Äôve opened, and/or customer service tickets they‚Äôve raised‚Äîall funnel back to one place, giving you one source of truth for every shopper. Black Friday might only last one day, but consumers are still open to making holiday purchases in the run up to the big event. Klaviyo found that more than half of consumers think a month earlier than November is the ideal time for brands to initiate their holiday shopping season sales. Most retailers start seeding their Black Friday email promotions 21 days before the big event‚Äîa strategy dubbed ‚ÄúBlack November,‚Äù which includes other holiday shopping dates: The majority of consumers look for discounts and sales during this period‚Äîso much so, 7 in 10 consider price the top factor in their holiday purchase decisions, beating quality (61%), variety (34%), and warranties or returns policies (31%). Take advantage of consumers‚Äô openness to pre-Black Friday promotions by creating a holiday calendar. Perhaps you give your email list early access to your sale, or build hype around a new product drop by teasing it to subscribers, with an automated series like this: Not all holiday shoppers are the same. Some might be looking for gifts for a loved one‚Äîothers might want to take advantage of a hefty discount to buy a product that‚Äôs been on their wishlist for months. Segmentation allows you to identify these buyer preferences and deliver personalized Black Friday email marketing campaigns. Key Black Friday customer segments to email include: Customers who‚Äôve visited your New Orleans store within the last six months, for instance, could receive an email that invites them to your retail store‚Äôs exclusive holiday sale which starts two days before Black Friday. Yet instead of relying solely on historical data to forecast each segment‚Äôs next steps, lean on predictive analytics. These tools digest large datasets using machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately predict what a customer will do next. üí°Tip: Shopify‚Äôs segmentation features pull data from unified customer profiles to group customers based on qualities they share. Choose from prebuilt segment templates, or build your own with the ShopifyQL query editor. All segments are dynamic‚Äîsubscribers will move in and out of segments automatically when data from their unified profile changes. Segmentation isn‚Äôt the only way to personalize emails around the Black Friday weekend. Dynamic content blocks adjust smaller sections of your email, instead of sending the same email to everyone who fits your segmentation criteria. Let‚Äôs say, for example, that you‚Äôve defined a segment of VIP customers to target during Black Friday. Subscribers have one thing in common‚Äîthey have a customer lifetime value of over $500‚Äîbut they don‚Äôt all share the same buying behaviors. Some have saved the loyalty rewards they‚Äôve earned‚Äîothers have made a portion of their purchases in-store. Further personalize the Black Friday emails that each subscriber in this segment receives with dynamic content blocks. That could be: Black Friday sales are effective because they‚Äôre exclusive‚Äîeither in terms of product quantity (for example, a limited amount of inventory) or because the promotion ends at a specific time. Lean into this time sensitivity and encourage Black Friday subscribers to take advantage now rather than later. This scarcity can induce the fear of missing out, a psychological phenomenon that influences people to buy even when they didn‚Äôt intend on doing so. Effective marketing techniques to create urgency in your Black Friday emails include: reMarkable, for example, has a countdown timer in their email to announce Black Friday is ending. It offers visual representation of when the deal ends, instead of just a generic ‚ÄúSale ends tonight!‚Äù message. Email inboxes are a crowded place to be at the best of times‚Äînever mind on Black Friday, when every retailer wants to capitalize on consumers‚Äô willingness to buy. Email marketing platform Omnisend processed 1.13 billion emails in the week surrounding BFCM. Klaviyo reported similar figures: at its peak, merchants sent 420 million messages in a single hour on Black Friday. An email subject line is the first thing that subscribers see when your campaign lands in their inbox. A best practice is to split-test strategies such as: Here are some real examples that incorporate these best practices and stood out to me during the Black Friday weekend last year: Promotions and flash drops can incentivize holiday shoppers to make impulsive purchases. Remove the biggest barrier to them doing so‚Äîfinding the money to pay for their order‚Äîby offering buy now, pay later (BNPL). During the BFCM weekend last year, consumers spent over $686.3 million on BNPL purchases, up 8.8% from the year before. Of those who have used this type of service, almost a third say they‚Äôd be more likely to spend money on discretionary goods if the retailer offered BNPL as an option. Shop Pay Installments offers an easy way to add BNPL options at checkout. Customers can choose to divide their purchases into smaller, more manageable installments. Combined with Shop Pay, the best-converting checkout on the internet, it‚Äôs no surprise that Shop Pay Installments has been proven to reduce cart abandonment by 28% and increase average order value by as much as 50%. Email might be the only direct line of communication you have with Black Friday customers, but it‚Äôs not the only way to command their attention. SMS marketing is the easiest integration since most email marketing platforms, including Klaviyo, offer SMS integration as standard. For example, you could send an email campaign to a particular segment, then use SMS to follow up with those who haven‚Äôt yet redeemed the offer or opened the email. It‚Äôs an approach proven to get results: Klaviyo reports that merchants who integrated SMS into their Black Friday email marketing strategy experienced a 20% YoY increase in ecommerce revenue during BFCM, accounting for more than $100 million in gross merchandise value. Email can also complement paid advertising strategies as costs skyrocket throughout Black Friday season. Shopify Audiences builds custom retargeting lists to export to platforms like Meta, Google Ads, and TikTok. It‚Äôs helped merchants like Happy Hippo achieve a 4.7x return on ad spend (ROAS) while cutting customer acquisition costs (CAC) by 72%. ‚ÄúShopify Audiences is a huge benefit for Plus merchants,‚Äù says CEO and lead product designer Adam Biel. ‚ÄúIt has helped lower customer acquisition costs so our investments can stretch much further with Facebook ads.‚Äù Transactional emails tend to be overlooked when marketers attempt to compete with other retailers for attention during Black Friday. Yet they‚Äôre an opportunity to strengthen relationships with the customers you‚Äôve already acquired. Comb through the automated emails you send as standard when customers complete a certain action. Here are some examples and ideas to optimize them: Black Friday, Cyber Monday regularly break records, but not all of them are good. Most customers acquired during BFCM have a lower lifetime value. This occurs partly because these customers were being opportunistic and taking advantage of your promotions, but also because your brand loses mindshare throughout the year. Design an email retention sequence to retain holiday shoppers after Black Friday ends. You could: üí°Tip: Shopify Flow takes the logistical hassle out of these holiday marketing automations. Work from prebuilt templates‚Äîsuch as inviting shoppers to your loyalty program when their unified customer profile meets specific criteria‚Äîor custom code your own. It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in the excitement of new promotions and segmentation strategies that turn email subscribers into paying customers‚Äîso much so, that retailers often forget the fundamentals. Here‚Äôs a quick reminder of the email optimization best practices to keep in mind while writing Black Friday emails: If you‚Äôre in the midst of a creative lull and are searching for ideas on how to make your Black Friday emails stand out, draw inspiration from these examples. Shoppers are especially prone to abandoning online carts in search of better Black Friday deals. This cart recovery email from Pulp & Press reminds each individual customer of the products they abandoned, with a reminder that it‚Äôs the biggest sale of the year‚Äîand that they should take advantage now, before the deal ends. Black Friday might be the biggest online sales event of the year, but it‚Äôs not always the most profitable. Discounts tend to lure in low-value customers who might only purchase from you when products are heavily discounted. Detox Market‚Äôs Black Friday email is a great example of how to combat this with tiered promotions. The more customers spend, the bigger the discount. Freaks of Nature leans into scarcity with their ‚Äúalmost gone‚Äù Black Friday email. The call to action button tells people to ‚Äúsecure‚Äù their shirt‚Äîmore strategic than just ‚Äúget yours today.‚Äù Plus, it uses price anchoring to showcase the before and after sale price of each bestseller. There are also direct checkout links for email subscribers to complete their purchases without searching the online store for the perfect item. It‚Äôs tempting to shout about your bestselling products or hefty discounts with innovative email designs. Home furnishings brand Revival takes a different approach. Instead, the brand shares a letter authored by their founder, which wishes them a wonderful holiday weekend with a gentle nudge to buy the item on their wishlist. The email also features a note beneath the sign-off that teases the following day‚Äôs email. This tactic can increase open rates during Black Friday‚Äîsubscribers are already on the lookout for the campaign. With so much competition to reach your target market during Black Friday, leaning into your brand values can attract conscious consumers who care more about sticking to their morals than impressive discounts. Deodorant brand Fussy, for example, is a certified B-Corp that sells deodorants made with natural ingredients and refillable cases designed to reduce plastic waste. Their target audience cares about sustainability, hence why the retailer‚Äôs Black Friday email marketing strategy was to rename the event ‚ÄúGreen Week.‚Äù Email marketing spans every stage of the customer journey, from aiding initial product discovery to encouraging customer retention. Shopify has everything you need to personalize this end-to-end experience, including unified customer profiles and segmentation to put your data to work. Plus, when holiday email campaigns drive record levels of website traffic, you don‚Äôt have to worry about outages or downtime. Shopify‚Äôs infrastructure handled over 57.3 PB of data, 1.19 trillion edge requests, and 10.5 trillion database queries during the last BFCM. It‚Äôs why leading brands like Represent, Knix, and Muscle Nation trust Shopify to capitalize on Black Friday sales. ‚ÄúBlack Friday can be nerve-wracking,‚Äù says Stefan Lewis, chief digital officer at Represent. ‚ÄúBut Shopify has always helped us in terms of increasing bandwidth and we‚Äôve never run into any issues around site speed.‚Äù Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) email is a marketing strategy where retailers reach their target customers through targeted emails. These holiday campaigns typically include promotions, sales, discounts, gift suggestions, and product recommendations. To write an effective Black Friday email, lead with a time-sensitive offer in the subject line and header. Use mobile-first design, highlight bestsellers or exclusives, and include urgency-driven CTAs like ‚Äúget yours before it‚Äôs too late.‚Äù The best time to send Black Friday emails is in the runup to the big event. Most consumers start holiday gift shopping before Black Friday arrives. A pre-launch campaign can ensure your brand is top of mind when they‚Äôre ready to buy. Use targeted emails to announce a Black Friday sale. Divide your audience into segments based on traits they share, and include contextual recommendations‚Äîfor example, discounts on products similar to those they‚Äôve bought.

Title: S&P 500 hits new record high despite U.S.-Canada trade tensions

Saturday, 28 Jun 2025 NEW YORK, June 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stock index S&P 500 closed at record high on Friday, despite a brief retreat following U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement on terminating all trade talks with Canada. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 432.43 points, or 1 percent, to 43,819.27, boosted by huge gains from Nike after a better-than-expected earnings report. The S&P 500 added 32.05 points, or 0.52 percent, to 6,173.07, a record close high for the first time since February. The Nasdaq Composite Index increased by 105.54 points, or 0.52 percent, to 20,273.46. Nine of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in green, with consumer discretionary and communication services leading the gainers by adding 1.78 percent and 1.55 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, energy and health led the laggards by losing 0.50 percent and 0.17 percent, respectively. Equities initially moved higher in the morning following comments by U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who told Bloomberg News late Thursday that a framework agreement between China and the United States on trade had been finalized. However, momentum faded after Trump posted on Truth Social that negotiations with Canada were off, injecting fresh uncertainty into global trade dynamics. "I can see where the risks are here -- if the trade is just hype from the White House and no deals are really forthcoming, then this market is going to roll over," Thierry Wizman, global FX and rates strategist at Macquarie Group. "Ultimately, this all comes back to growth in the U.S. economy and growth of earnings." On the economic front, U.S. personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, rose 0.1 percent in May on a seasonally adjusted basis, in line with expectations. The annual inflation rate came in at 2.3 percent, matching economists' forecasts. Core PCE price index, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, increased by 0.2 percent for the month and 2.7 percent year over year, slightly above expectations of 0.1 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively. U.S. investor sentiment improved in June as inflation fears pulled back, according to the University of Michigan's latest survey released Friday. The headline sentiment reading rose to 60.7, up 16.3 percent from May and close to the Dow Jones estimate for 60.5. The index was still 11 percent below the same month a year ago. "Consumers continue to be concerned about the potential impact of tariffs, but at this time they do not appear to be connecting developments in the Middle East with the economy," survey director Joanne Hsu said in a statement. In corporate news, Nike led gains across major indexes, with its shares surging 15.19 percent after the company reported quarterly earnings that topped Wall Street estimates. The sportswear giant also unveiled plans to offset potential tariff-related headwinds, which investors viewed positively. Large-cap technology stocks were mixed. Tesla fell 1.34 percent, while Alphabet and Amazon gained more than 2 percent. Broadcom and Microsoft posted modest losses, while Nvidia and Meta Platforms were up more than 1 percent, continuing their recent upward momentum. U.S. stock markets have shown resilience in recent weeks amid volatile geopolitical and economic headlines, as investors assess trade developments and incoming economic data for clues on the Fed's next moves.

ByMoneyShow ByMoneyShow, Contributor. Big Tech is back in the driver‚Äôs seat! The technology sector has been leading the market rally off the early-April lows ‚Äì with sizable double-digit gains piling up. Here are three ways you can profit, courtesy of top MoneyShow experts. Mike Larson MoneyShow.com Big Tech is SO back. Again. Ever since the stock market bottomed out on April 7, we‚Äôve seen most (though not ALL) of the biggest technology stocks rocket higher. All but two are outperforming smaller-capitalization stocks, as represented by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), as well as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) -- as you can see in this MoneyShow Chart of the Day. Big Tech SPY IWM Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) is the Big Tech name with the most post-‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù juice ‚Äì up 58%. Tesla Inc. (TSLA) isn‚Äôt far behind, with a 40.4% rally. Next are Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Meta Platforms Inc. (META), both nipping at Tesla‚Äôs heels with gains of 37.8% and 37.3%. Only Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) are notably lagging (+11.2% and +16.4%, respectively). What‚Äôs behind the resumption of the Big Tech trade ‚Äì a trade that has periodically popped back up over the past year or two? A few things... First, investors are boosting bets on earlier Federal Reserve rate cuts. Lower rates help boost growth-stock multiples. Second, concerns about tariff and trade policy have eased. President Trump has dialed backed some of his most punitive tariffs ‚Äì and signaled a willingness to keep negotiating with trade partners. That could prevent some of the worst-case tech supply chain scenarios from playing out. Third, FOMO is back in play. Investors got too bearish during the declines, didn‚Äôt get on board early enough in the subsequent rally, and they‚Äôre now dog-piling into old favorites to play catch up. Add it all up and you have a tech sector that is leading again ‚Äì and driving the averages to new highs. From where I sit, that‚Äôs bullish‚Ä¶and underscores why my ‚ÄúBe (Selectively) Bold‚Äù approach (still) looks like the right one here. Joe Markman Digital Creators & Consumers It‚Äôs happening in real-time, yet most investors remain completely oblivious. The ‚Äúit‚Äù is the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution, the greatest productivity accelerant since electricity. Let‚Äôs talk about what it means for Microsoft Corp. (MSFT). According to a report on Bloomberg, MSFT is planning to cut thousands of jobs in its Xbox gaming division. These cuts will be in addition to the 6,000 employees fired in May at LinkedIn and other Microsoft subsidiaries. This is a sticky subject. There is going to be massive disruption. But it is a wonderful time to be a Microsoft shareholder. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Analysts scoffed at Magnificent Seven corporate leaders when they kept increasing capital expenditures for AI infrastructure. Research suggested that the companies would never earn a return on that invested capital because they couldn‚Äôt imagine a large-enough business to justify the investment. When Satya Nadella, Microsoft‚Äôs chief executive, invested $10 billion in OpenAI two years ago, Wall Street analysts thought he had lost his mind. There was no demand for another Siri, they wrote. What the analysts missed then is that ChatGPT, OpenAI‚Äôs flagship product, isn‚Äôt Siri. ChatGPT can write software code, while Siri can barely play songs on Apple Music. Apple Inc.‚Äôs (AAPL) digital assistant was never going to succeed, mostly due to corporate culture. The iPhone maker is a hardware company. But executives at the other Mag-7 companies live and breathe software. They understood immediately what ChatGPT was, and they went all-in on AI. Make no mistake: layoffs at the biggest software companies are about to become much more common. This is because large portions of software employees can be replaced with AI. In the same way that electricity enabled mechanized, automated production that required fewer workers to achieve greater output, AI software is going to hollow out large parts of white-collar work. These changes will happen swiftly and persistently, as they are now occurring at Microsoft. In the past, foundational technology shifts have led to greater employment as new sectors and businesses were born. Pessimists said the Internet was going to shutter the global economy. More than two decades later, it turns out that connecting the entire world to a network led to millions of new jobs in the digital economy and employment in business verticals that previously did not exist. The flip side for investors is that productivity means increased profits. When headcounts are lower, more money flows to the bottom line. None of this is being reflected currently in share price valuations. Expect this to change in the second half of 2025 as hyperscalers talk about doing more with less, much to the surprise of the Wall Street analyst community. Recommended Action: Buy MSFT. George Gilder Gilder‚Äôs Technology Report The market capitalization leaderboard for semiconductors continues to highlight the divergence between IP ownership and physical production. US firms dominate the top rankings ‚Äî Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) at $2.476 trillion, Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) at $804 billion ‚Äî but that masks how irreplaceable the manufacturing layer has become in a geopolitically fractured world. Key fabrication and tooling players like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), Samsung, and ASML Holding NV (ASML) remain undervalued by comparison. This valuation gap reflects investor focus on scalability and software leverage. Top 10 Semiconductors In today‚Äôs semiconductor market, location defines exposure, not necessarily strength. Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) ‚Äî all US-headquartered ‚Äî are rewarded for their innovation, commanding premium valuations and massive market capitalizations. But their products are inseparable from the Asian manufacturing ecosystem. TSMC, Samsung, and ASML remain irreplaceable at the physical layer of chip production. Tariffs, meanwhile, distort incentives. They penalize final assembly hubs like China without reshoring critical stages such as wafer fabrication or back-end packaging. This imbalance creates investment opportunities ‚Äî and risks. US design-centric firms gain margin leverage, but companies controlling equipment, lithography, or memory ‚Äî like ASML, Applied Materials, and SK Hynix ‚Äî are the real backbone of global production. Investors should pay close attention to companies bridging these two worlds: Those that own irreplaceable manufacturing capacity and are structurally tied to Western markets. ASML and TSM remain critical infrastructure. Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT), Lam Research Corp. (LRCX), and KLA Corp. (KLAC) control the tools that keep fabs alive. Nvidia and Broadcom may lead the stock market ‚Äî but it‚Äôs the factory floor that decides who can actually deliver.

Title: Nvidia breakout puts $4 trillion market value within reach

Two years after Nvidia Corp. made history by becoming the first chipmaker to achieve a $1 trillion market capitalization, an even more remarkable milestone is within its grasp: becoming the first company to reach $4 trillion. After the emergence of China‚Äôs DeepSeek sent the stock plunging earlier this year and stoked concerns that outlays on artificial intelligence infrastructure were set to slow, Nvidia shares have rallied back to a record. Its biggest customers remain full steam ahead on spending, much of which is flowing to its computing systems. A 66% gain from an April low has pushed its market capitalization to $3.8 trillion, overtaking Microsoft Corp. at $3.70 trillion to again become the world‚Äôs most valuable company. Nvidia shares rose as much as 1.3% in early trading Friday. With a broadening customer base clamoring for Nvidia‚Äôs latest AI accelerators and competitors still distant, bulls are betting the chipmaker‚Äôs shares have plenty of room to run. ‚ÄúWe believe that Nvidia is truly uniquely positioned, and that it will sustain its position over the next decade-plus,‚Äù said Aziz Hamzaogullari, chief investment officer at Loomis, Sayles & Co. and founder of the firm‚Äôs growth equity strategies team. Hamzaogullari isn‚Äôt alone. This week, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah raised Nvidia‚Äôs price target to $250 from $175, a level that would equate to a roughly $6 trillion market value. Baruah, who has a buy rating on the stock, expects annual AI spending from various types of customers to rise to nearly $2 trillion by 2028. ‚ÄúWhile it may seem fantastic that Nvidia fundamentals can continue to amplify from current levels, we remind folks that Nvidia remains essentially a monopoly for critical tech, and that it has pricing (and margin) power,‚Äù Baruah wrote in a research note on June 25. The bullish sentiment behind Nvidia and other makers of AI gear is a stark reversal from earlier in the year when the emergence of advanced chatbots like DeepSeek, developed relatively cheaply in China, sparked fears that Nvidia‚Äôs customers would cut spending. Instead, US tech giants are plowing even more money into computing infrastructure. Read More: Nvidia Attempts to Breakout of Range Relative to the S&P 500 Microsoft, Meta, Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. are projected to put about $350 billion into capital expenditures in their upcoming fiscal years, up from $310 billion in the current year, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Those companies account for more than 40% of Nvidia‚Äôs revenue. Of course, there are still plenty of risks that could derail Nvidia‚Äôs rally. The company relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. for the production of its chips, exposing Nvidia to US President Donald Trump‚Äôs trade policies, which can change on a whim. Trump‚Äôs 90-day pause on the stiffest tariffs is set to end on July 9. At the same time, there‚Äôs no guarantee Nvidia‚Äôs biggest customers won‚Äôt change their tune on spending in coming years. Many of them are developing their own chips to avoid the steep prices commanded by Nvidia. ‚ÄúThe valuation depends on the persistence of growth, and we already know that Nvidia‚Äôs largest customers are trying to figure out ways to be more efficient with their spending, not just with Nvidia, but also offloading to their own silicon,‚Äù said Dan Davidowitz, chief investment officer at Polen Capital Management. ‚ÄúYou have to have very robust assumptions to get comfortable with the valuation, and we just don‚Äôt have a good enough view on what that demand looks like.‚Äù Nvidia shares are priced at 32 times earnings projected over the next 12 months, compared with 22 times for the S&P 500. The stock‚Äôs valuation doesn‚Äôt bother Loomis Sayles‚Äôs Hamzaogullari, who remains a firm believer that AI will transform society and is convinced that Nvidia will remain a key winner as productivity gains from the technology expand. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt mean it will be steady Eddie all the time, that there won‚Äôt be disruptions in spending, but this is a secular structural change, and Nvidia remains one of the biggest beneficiaries,‚Äù Hamzaogullari said. ‚ÄúThe stock still looks attractive given that backdrop.‚Äù ¬© 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Philippe Laffont‚Äîthe billionaire behind Coatue Management‚Äîwent and dropped Bitcoin into his ‚ÄúFantastic 40,‚Äù his own shortlist of what he thinks will shine as top investments over the next five years. Laffont ranked Bitcoin alongside Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Meta, while leaving out Apple and Google. He says waking up at 3 a.m. wondering why he missed out drove him to rethink his stance. Based on reports from CNBC, he hasn‚Äôt bought any yet but thinks its market cap could jump past $5 trillion by 2030. That would put it in the same league as the biggest tech names. According to his own research, the Coatue Management big boss sees Microsoft climbing to a $5.7 trillion valuation and Nvidia reaching $5.6 trillion in the next five years. He paints Bitcoin as a rival asset, forecasting it will more than double from roughly $2.1 trillion today. He says the world‚Äôs net worth of $450‚Äì500 trillion gives room for new winners. Equities sit near $120 trillion and gold above and under ground at about $20 trillion. His case rests on bigger acceptance and smoother swings in price. Based on his figures, Bitcoin must average around 10‚Äì15% annual growth to hit $5 trillion by 2030. He sees volatility shrinking from daily moves of 5‚Äì7% to roughly half of that. That, he says, makes the crypto feel more like the Nasdaq. The tycoon points to de-dollarization as another tailwind. If global players shift away from the US dollar, Bitcoin could pick up more steam. Not everyone is convinced. Eric Semler of Semler Scientific notes lots of hedge funds still doubt Bitcoin‚Äôs staying power. They worry momentum will vanish once the US President Donald Trump factor fades. Meanwhile, Bybit‚Äôs Shunyet Jan forecasts Bitcoin at $125,000 by the end of Q2 if current trends hold. Crypto analyst Scott Melker goes even further, predicting a surge to $250,000 by end-2025 thanks to more big investors jumping in. Semler Scientific already holds 4,450 BTC. The firm plans to build that to 10,000 by year-end. Its chairman says many peers aren‚Äôt ready to follow suit. They see Bitcoin as too tied to politics. That caution keeps some big wallets on the sidelines. Regulatory moves remain the biggest wild card. Harsh rules could stall growth and scare off new buyers. Competition is rising too. Ether staking, Layer 2 networks and central bank digital currencies might chip away at Bitcoin‚Äôs crown. And a strong rebound in the US dollar or a broad stock sell-off could pull crypto down with it.

People experiencing homelessness (PEH) face complex health and social care needs, contributing to poor health outcomes and premature mortality. The Pharmacy Homeless Outreach Engagement Non-medical Independent prescribing Rx (PHOENIx) intervention was developed to address these challenges through assertive outreach by NHS pharmacist independent prescribers working with third sector homelessness charity workers for PEH presenting to community pharmacy. This qualitative study aims to explore participant, healthcare professional, and stakeholder perceptions of the PHOENIx intervention and acceptability of trial procedures. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with trial participants, internal stakeholders (healthcare professionals/researchers), and external stakeholders (national and local) across two intervention sites (Glasgow and Birmingham) between March 2023 and February 2024. Data was analysed thematically using Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) as a conceptual framework. Participants (n = 26; usual care n = 7; intervention n = 19) viewed PHOENIx as distinctively comprehensive, consistent, and caring, valuing its holistic approach and the trusting relationships developed with the team. Stakeholders (n = 16; internal n = 5; external n = 11) recognised PHOENIx‚Äôs potential to fill gaps in current service provision for PEH, appreciating its flexible, outreach-based model. Challenges identified included resource constraints, integration with existing services, and concerns about long-term sustainability. The PHOENIx intervention shows promise in providing accessible, comprehensive healthcare which was acceptable to PEH. Its success in engaging this underserved population offers valuable lessons for service development. However, addressing challenges around resources, scalability, and sustainability will be important considerations for a future trial and wider implementation and expansion.

Homelessness remains a significant and growing public health concern globally, with an estimated 895,000 people experiencing homelessness in Europe [1]. In Scotland, homeless applications increased from 35,759‚Äì39,006 in the year 2022‚Äì2023, representing a 9% increase [2]. Similarly, the rates of rough sleeping have also increased across other parts of the UK. In England there has been a 27% increase in rough sleeping in the year 2022‚Äì2023, as indicated by the most recent ‚Äòsnapshot‚Äô [3]. People experiencing homelessness (PEH) face complex health and social care needs, contributing to premature mortality [4]. The average age of death for PEH is 45 years old, compared to 76 years in the general population [5]. Multiple factors contribute to this health inequality, including higher rates of physical and mental health conditions including substance use disorders, and barriers to accessing healthcare services [6,7]. PEH frequently experience multimorbidity, with a high prevalence of concurrent physical and mental health conditions [8]. Over 70% of PEH have underlying problem street-drug use [9]. Drug-related deaths among this population are particularly concerning, with a third of all deaths of PEH being street-drug-related [10]. Despite many receiving care from alcohol and drug recovery services, including daily prescribed opiate replacement therapy, there continues to be a high rate of overdoses experienced within the population [11]. Access to healthcare remains challenging for PEH due to stigma, discrimination, complex health systems that are difficult to navigate [12,13] and bureaucratic barriers [14,15]. As a result, unmet health needs are common [16,17]. Mental illness, pain, and substance dependency may be poorly managed [18], with evidence suggesting under-prescribing [11] and low rates of prescription adherence [19,20]. Patterns of emergency healthcare utilisation differ between PEH and those who are housed, with PEH facing higher rates of emergency room visits, hospitalisations, and readmissions [21,22]. Reasons for these visits also differ, with PEH more likely to present for drug, alcohol, and mental health-related problems, often in need of acute and crisis care [21,22,23,24]. While the availability and uptake of preventative healthcare is lower among PEH [14,21,25], presentations to primary care tend to be reactive [26]. It is estimated that one-third of homeless deaths are preventable through timely and effective use of health services [27]. However, there is a lack of robustly evaluated person-centred, integrated, community-based effective and cost- effective complex interventions for PEH [28]. In response to these challenges, innovative approaches are needed to address the intersecting issues of homelessness and problem drug use [29]. The PHOENIx (Pharmacist led Homeless Outreach Engagement Non-medical Independent prescribing Rx) intervention was first developed as a novel, low-threshold service offered to PEH in Glasgow, Scotland [30‚Äì33], which was reported to be well received by PEH [34]. This complex health and social care intervention aimed to address the multiple unmet needs of PEH through weekly assertive outreach by National Health Service (NHS) pharmacist independent prescribers working in collaboration with third sector homelessness charity workers. The PHOENIx intervention provided intensive and holistic health and social care support with persistent follow-up. Participants are visited via outreach and seen by PHOENIx workers (a pharmacist and third sector worker) at least once per week, with priorities set by the PEH and addressed gradually in succession. The intervention offered immediate health care and assessment, medication prescribing, and practical support such as advocacy, assistance with benefits applications, and provision of general wellbeing support [35]. Previous qualitative research based on the evaluation of the PHOENIx model of care in other settings has indicated that PHOENIx may improve health outcomes for PEH. Initial quantitative studies from previous evaluation of the PHOENIx model [11,36,37] have also highlighted the potential positive impact of the intervention on health-related quality of life [9], treatment burden, and delaying time to hospitalisation. However, there is a need for rigorous evaluation of whether the PHOENIx intervention can be delivered and how it is received, in other settings, e.g., community pharmacies and beyond Glasgow, in order to address the public health crisis of drug-related deaths and improve health outcomes for PEH. This study aims to explore participant, healthcare professional, researcher and stakeholder perceptions of the PHOENIx intervention and acceptability of trial procedures related to the PHOENIx Community Pharmacy model in Glasgow (Scotland) and Birmingham (England), UK. By examining the experiences and perspectives of those involved in the intervention, we seek to inform future developments and potential scale-up of this complex intervention to address the major health inequalities faced by PEH in the community pharmacy setting. The study used a qualitative design, involving semi-structured interviews with PHOENIx trial patient participants, healthcare professionals (HCPs) and researchers involved in the intervention and key stakeholders, including HCPs and third sector workers. Interviews were conducted across the two trial sites (Glasgow and Birmingham) between March 2023 and February 2024. Eligible participants were those who participated in the PHOENIx trial (both intervention and control arm participants) or played a role in the implementation of the intervention. Key stakeholders included those with an interest in the care/ service provision of PEH. Stakeholders were identified using a combination of professional networks, and snowball sampling. Ethical approval (REC reference 22/EM/0119; IRAS project ID: 309760) and Health Research Authority approval were obtained before recruitment and participants in the trial and qualitative process evaluation elements provided written informed consent before participation. All participants of the PHOENIx intervention, including those in the usual care group, were eligible to participate in interviews. Those eligible were approached by intervention workers to ascertain interest in participation. Those who expressed interest in taking part in interviews were supported by intervention staff and researchers to arrange a convenient time and date to conduct the interview. Interviews with intervention participants were conducted face-to-face, within community hubs that provide services to PEH at both trial sites. Those who expressed interest in participating were provided with an invitation pack containing a participant information sheet and consent form. At the time of interview, participants were given the opportunity to ask questions before providing written informed consent. Where needed, addition support was provided to potential participants to complete consent procedures, including the reading of the participant information sheet. Interviews with trial participants were around 60- minutes in duration (including consent procedures) and were audio-recorded. All interviews were transcribed verbatim, providing the data for qualitative analysis. Trial participants were given a ¬£20 shopping voucher as a thank you for their time. Those involved in the delivery of the PHOENIx intervention (intervention staff and researchers) and key external stakeholders were invited to participate in interviews on a voluntary basis. External stakeholders were identified using professional networks and ‚Äòsnowball‚Äô sampling. Those who expressed an interest in taking part were contacted by email and provided with an invitation pack that included a participant information sheet and a copy of the consent form. Once agreement had been made, interviews were arranged at a convenient day and time for the interviewee. Interviews were conducted either face to face, or via online video platforms, whichever was most convenient for the participants. At the time of interview participants were given the opportunity to ask questions before providing written informed consent. Those interviewed remotely via a video platform were required to sign and email the consent form to the researcher. In addition, verbal consent was taken and recorded at the start of the interview. Interviews with staff delivering the PHOENIx intervention and researchers were between 30‚Äì60 minutes in duration and were audio recorded. A topic guide was used to structure the interviews. The topic guide, informed by Normalisation Process Theory (NPT), explored several aspects including overall perception of the PHOENIx intervention, engagement with the intervention team, perceived impacts of the intervention and the acceptability of the trial procedures. NPT is a sociological theory that describes four mechanisms that can be used to explain and evaluate the adoption and implementation of complex interventions or service innovations [36]. The topic guides for interviews with the PHOENIx team and other key stakeholders also included discussion topics such as the main challenges to achieving optimal health care and support for PEH and the barriers and facilitators of the intervention, which were not included in intervention participant interviews. Data were analysed thematically with NPT used as an underpinning conceptual lens. The four constructs include: ‚Äúcoherence‚Äù (sense-making work); ‚Äúcognitive participation‚Äù (relationship work); ‚Äúcollective action‚Äù (enacting work); and ‚Äúreflexive monitoring‚Äù (appraisal work) [36]. These mechanisms were used to guide and structure conceptualisation of the analysis. Transcripts were analysed thematically after initial familiarisation. Thematic analysis is a method for identifying, analysing, and reporting recurring patterns within data [38]. A two-step method of analyses was used, with the data initially analysed with the aim of identifying recurring themes, and then subsequently analysed using the NPT framework. This qualitative method of analysis allows for the use of both inductive (bottom-up) and deductive (top-down) approaches. This ‚Äòbottom up‚Äô approach allowed for greater initial exploration of the data, free from the constraints of a theoretical model. This methodology was considered to be appropriate in order to truly recognise themes that the theory might not capture [38]. An initial coding framework was developed after becoming familiar with the data. All transcripts were double-coded by HS, SM, KW and YC to ensure the robustness of the data interpretation and coding, with any queries or discrepancies discussed and resolved by the coding team. Following the double coding of all transcripts a summary report was produced, and themes generated mapped to the mechanisms described in the NPT framework. Our findings are presented under four key themes and components of the NPT framework:1) coherence; 2) cognitive participation; 3) collective action; and 4) reflexive monitoring. These themes are described for both intervention participants and stakeholders, and illustrative quotations are provided in the following section. Participants consistently distinguished the PHOENIx intervention from their usual care experiences. They highlighted the comprehensive and personalised nature of the service, which contrasted sharply with their previous encounters with health and social care services. ‚ÄúTrying to find a way to move on from here, housing, medication, understanding your situation because everyone‚Äôs unique. Most support workers, especially on this building, a support session to them is like:‚Äù‚ÄùIs your housing benefit still active? Great.‚Äù You know what I mean? The Phoenix programme, they‚Äôre actually trying to help find out a way to move forward: ‚ÄùDo you have bank accounts? Do you have ID? Do you have a housing option?‚Äù You speak to the support workers here and it‚Äôs just like:‚ÄùHave you paid your service charge? Okay, fuck off, you know.‚Äù (IB05, Intervention participant) ‚ÄúYeah, kind of. Not lost in the system, just overlooked. Overlooked is‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs more important things to do. I think that‚Äôs the way it feels like sometimes.‚Äù (CB15, Usual care participant). Many participants expressed frustration with their previous care, particularly in relation to addiction and mental health services. They felt that PHOENIx offered a more holistic and responsive approach. ‚ÄúNo because they‚Äôre just, it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre just there to hand in my script. They [addictions team] do ask me: ‚ÄúHow you feeling?‚Äù but most of the time I‚Äôm just in and back out.‚Äù (IG011, Intervention participant) ‚ÄúSo I made an appointment for that, and I didn‚Äôt go to that appointment, but they sent me another appointment out. [‚Ä¶]And that‚Äôs another reason why I have to see a doctor, because I‚Äôve been discharged from the mental health team, because I haven‚Äôt been good at keeping appointments with them either.‚Äù (IB6, Intervention participant) Participants valued the consistent and reliable nature of the PHOENIx intervention. The regular contact and follow-up were seen as crucial elements that distinguished this service from others they had experienced. This consistency helped to build trust and rapport between participants and the PHOENIx team, facilitating deeper engagement with the intervention. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult to walk in and ask and saying what I need, because I‚Äôm used to doing everything myself but I wasn‚Äôt doing it because I was so down. Once I knew how they were and that and they weren‚Äôt judging, it was easy. They made it pleasurable. They made a good thing out of a bad situation.‚Äù (IB1, Intervention participant) ‚ÄúWell, building up a relationship, I‚Äôm getting to know them better and knowing that they are proper guys [PHOENIx team] that want to help you and not just, like, guys that are reading out of books and don‚Äôt know nothing and they‚Äôre trying but they‚Äôve not got the heart in it, if you know what I mean?‚Äù (IG6, Intervention participant) It was recognised by some intervention participants that the consistency of the support worker role was a challenge to the delivery of the intervention. This highlighted the need for consistency in this role. ‚ÄúI want to continue with them, to be fair. I get a fair bit of help. It‚Äôs obviously just unfortunate that my support worker has gone ill for the last two weeks, but I‚Äôve been emailed about that. Obviously he‚Äôs got some issues. I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs another support worker that steps in in the meanwhile.‚Äù (IB5, Intervention participant) Participants recognised and appreciated both the practical and emotional support provided by the PHOENIx team. They noted how the intervention addressed not only their immediate health needs but also broader social and emotional concerns. ‚ÄúWell, I spoke to the doctors I‚Äôm scared to go to the doctors, so whereas like, [support worker] absolutely amazing, comes and picks me up and took me to the doctors and stuff. I wouldn‚Äôt have gone on my own so this project is absolutely amazing, it‚Äôs getting me back on my feet and I wouldn‚Äôt have even gone to the doctors. It‚Äôs not because I can‚Äôt go but I‚Äôm scared to go, you know when you‚Äôre scared of the doctors you get a family member will drag‚Ä¶you know what it‚Äôs like. I haven‚Äôt got no one like that, so with this support project it gets me back on my feet, it just helps me‚Ä¶puts me in touch with my support services and just does what a family would do, because I haven‚Äôt got a family like that. ‚Äú(IB7, Intervention participant) The combination of practical support and emotional care provided by the PHOENIx team was crucial in sustaining participants‚Äô engagement with the intervention. Participants felt that the team‚Äôs holistic approach addressed their complex needs in a way that encouraged ongoing participation. Trust and non-judgemental relationships were important to participants, with some participants feeling motivated by the trusting relationship with the PHOENIx team. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been amazing, to be honest, it‚Äôs been amazing. I‚Äôve never had help like this and I‚Äôve needed it for a long time and I‚Äôve never had this help. Not only has he become my pharmacist, he‚Äôs become a friend. We really have become friends and it‚Äôs really good now. Someone to speak to you when I need to, you know what I mean? He‚Äôs sorted out a lot of things for me as well, health-wise. I‚Äôm always in fights, and so if I get injured, I can go and see him and he looks after me. Do you know what I mean?‚Äù (IB3, Intervention participant). Participants described a wide range of practical support provided by the PHOENIx team, including help with medication management, assistance with benefits applications, and support in accessing other services. ‚ÄúOh, no, it was easy with [pharmacist]. Just when I was explaining to him, and I think my doctor keeps putting me on the Salbutamol, the Symbicort and Becotide and [pharmacist] put me on, I‚Äôm only on one steroid, kind of thing.[‚Ä¶] And it‚Äôs because they want me to sit and take them out of all the boxes and sit and take two puffs and then, shut one box and open another box. It‚Äôs just a matter of taking it out the one box, taking two puffs and that, yes, a great difference.‚Äù (IG3, Intervention participant) ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting somewhere now, I‚Äôm getting help with my benefits, I‚Äôm getting help with my housing, my prescriptions. And it‚Äôs all thanks to going to the right sources, like the Phoenix team, for instance.‚Äù (IG6, Intervention participant) Alongside this practical support, participants emphasised the emotional work undertaken by the team. This included providing a listening ear, offering encouragement, and helping to build participants‚Äô confidence and self-esteem. Participants noted how this combination of practical and emotional support enabled them to engage more effectively with their care and make positive changes in their lives. ‚ÄúI would say they‚Äôve covered a lot with me, like my drink, my mental health, how I‚Äôm feeling this day, what am I eating, about my day. So they‚Äôve covered a range of topics that no other people, even, like, my drugs worker has asked me, like what I‚Äôm eating and when I‚Äôm eating, am I eating regularly, like that.‚Äù (IG11, Intervention participant) Some participants expressed frustration that the PHOENIx team sometimes seemed limited in their ability to effect certain changes, particularly in areas like housing or specialist mental health support. Often, this lack of power is a result of the rules of other health and social care services, or long waiting times to access services. This perceived lack of power in certain areas led some participants to suggest that the team should be given more authority or resources to address complex needs. ‚ÄúAye. Well, I trusted their knowledge, but their knowledge didn‚Äôt go any further than that. And I mean they‚Äôve not got the powers to do anything. They can give me knowledge, but the knowledge that I then pass on to the ones that have got the power are just‚Ä¶‚Äù (IG2, Intervention participant) ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still waiting on an appointment to meet an alcohol worker. See, they‚Äôve actually been in contact with me before, but unbeknown to me, I‚Äôve either been on the drink or, I‚Äôm very forgetful as well, like, you know? So I‚Äôve either not remembered receiving the letter, and [support worker] has been in contact with them to say, look, they guy‚Äôs still looking for a bit of support. But I‚Äôm still waiting to hear from them, like, you know, that‚Äôs the [alcohol service].‚Äù (IG7, Intervention participant) Participants consistently highlighted the importance of ongoing, long-term support. Many expressed concerns about what would happen when the intervention ended, indicating the value they placed on the continuous care provided by PHOENIx. ‚ÄúYeah, 100 per cent. I‚Äôll be sad if it stops, because who have I got to go to then? And I‚Äôll just go back to square one again.‚Äù (IB3, Intervention participant) This emphasis on long-term support reflects the complex and chronic nature of many participants‚Äô health and social issues, and their recognition of the need for sustained intervention. Usual care participants highlighted the reactive and inflexible nature of services which do not meet their needs. ‚ÄúBecause there isn‚Äôt a lot of places, they always say:‚ÄùYes, have you been there?‚Äù but see when you go, they‚Äôre either shut or there‚Äôs nobody there or you need to come back another day. There‚Äôs never somewhere where you can just do a pick up. I‚Äôve only been told: ‚ÄùRight, yes, come up,‚Äù or you can just walk in and it‚Äôs there for you. It‚Äôs always‚Ä¶because you can‚Äôt have a breakdown at the correct time. Do you know what I‚Äôm talking about? If you need help, you can‚Äôt make sure it‚Äôs between nine and two or, do you know what I mean? It‚Äôs just, when you need help, you need help.‚Äù (CG13, Control participant) Intervention participants discussed the acceptability of the procedures of the intervention and trial. Overall, participants were supportive of the frequency and intensity of appointments with the PHOENIx team. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think the Phoenix was going to help but I signed up to it, but I just thought it was just another one of the survey things. They‚Äôre going to promise you the world and do nothing. They did as much as they have said.‚Äù (IB5, Intervention participant) However, there were challenges around the consistency of support from the support worker at one site as a result of recruitment and retention issues. For example, support workers moving on to other roles had an impact on the perceived consistency of support received. Intervention participants indicated that the study questionnaire was too long in length and duration to complete, with some indicating that they did not believe the questions to be relevant and potentially stigmatising. A perceived lack of concentration and capability to answer some of the questions made the questionnaire challenging for some. Some indicated that the questionnaire was a perceived barrier to taking part in the study, while a significant number of participants did not remember having completed the study questionnaire. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt really remember it to be honest but I ended up‚Ä¶ It was a 20 minute thing and I ended up spending two hours.‚Äù (IB2, Intervention participant) ‚ÄúThere were a few questions and I was like:‚ÄùForget that, let‚Äôs go onto the‚Ä¶‚Äù yeah, you don‚Äôt need to know that kind of thing, because why would you need to know certain things? It‚Äôs got nothing to do with why I‚Äôm really here them questions I see as judgement. Someone else is going to look at this sheet of paper and see certain questions that are nothing to do with me but I‚Äôm going to be judged on these certain questions because of the answers.‚Äù (IB3, Intervention participant) Stakeholders demonstrated a clear understanding of the various roles within the PHOENIx team and how these roles complemented each other to provide comprehensive care. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs good and I think it would get you so far. I mean, having a well-trained nurse practitioner, a pharmacist and a social worker, you would cover a lot of ground if those people were available to the person all the time. Obviously depending on how they all get on and everything. But those people working as like a mini- multidisciplinary team I think is a good idea.‚Äù (BS11, External Stakeholder) ‚ÄúWell, for me, it just seems like a really great way of doing things. Because from my perspective anyway, I [pharmacist] like to look at all the health stuff, and, yes, we‚Ä¶so, [support worker] is focused on the social things and the housing, but also, there‚Äôs a bit of a grey area as well, this aspect of, social stuff can really solve mental health issues, or at least improve the whole kind of thing. So, we both work on both sides of it, if you see what I mean. And there‚Äôs no real, I suppose‚Ä¶we just try and help people, whatever way is going to work.‚Äù (GS21, Internal Stakeholder) Stakeholders generally held positive views of the intervention, recognising its potential to address gaps in current service provision for PEH. Providing anticipatory care was one such gap that was discussed. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a really interesting project and it‚Ä¶from my experience with other homeless projects, it does bridge a gap that I could see and that I‚Äôve seen acutely, where people, you cannot get them to the‚Ä¶you might be supporting them with their housing, but you cannot get them to the GP, or to A&E, or to any healthcare professional, for love nor money. And having someone that can‚Ä¶an actual floating prescriber is a game changer, really, for these people‚Äôs health. And that‚Ä¶having that longer appointment time, and that sticky support, where they don‚Äôt get cut off just because they haven‚Äôt attended something, it‚Äôs so vital, because we‚Äôve got‚Ä¶the odds are stacked up against homeless people, so much that they need all the help that we can offer. And we‚Äôve got these pharmacists all across the country that could do this. So, I‚Äôd like to see the project grow, definitely, and I‚Äôd like to be part of it.‚Äù (BS9, Internal stakeholder) ‚ÄúI think that we know there is a gap...well, sorry, I believe there is a gap around wound care for people in the city centre particularly, probably the whole of the city, that are not engaged in community services for whatever reason. That is potentially something that PHOENIx could support with. We know that there is ongoing, as there always has been, the issues into...pathways into mental health support are always more difficult. We have got decent processes on paper, but when you speak to service users then they don‚Äôt reflect those processes. There is ongoing things like that that we are aware of and trying to do something about.‚Äù (GS23, External stakeholder) Stakeholders acknowledged the complex challenges involved in providing care to PEH and saw PHOENIx as a potential solution to some of these issues. Some challenges highlighted by stakeholders was increased complexity and demand on services, lack of opportunity to engage with PEH, competing priorities of PEH and complex navigation of services. ‚ÄúWe have a really good system of care in the city. Alcohol and drug recovery services are really responsive. They hold a huge caseload, but the level of complexity and the level of demand is just always increasing. It is a really transient population in the city because it attracts people in from all over the country.‚Äù (GS23, External stakeholder). ‚ÄúSo I think the main challenges are that people experiencing homelessness have lots of competing priorities, so they‚Äôre not always able to prioritise their health. There‚Äôs complications with their previous experience of using health services which are often very negative. They‚Äôre used to being turned away from places, told that this isn‚Äôt the right place for you, told you should be down the road, told you should have come before, you shouldn‚Äôt come now, you should come later, all of those things. They‚Äôre not really made to feel welcome in healthcare settings. I think that starts when people are young and they‚Äôre not confident, they‚Äôre often on their own, they often don‚Äôt have support. That‚Äôs the other thing, so they need support to navigate the health system. Usually we have that from friends, family, other people who will help us, but often people experiencing homelessness don‚Äôt have that. Having support is very important and that can make a big difference.‚Äù (BS11, External stakeholder) Stakeholders outside the immediate PHOENIx team generally viewed the intervention positively, recognising the team‚Äôs expertise and dedication. They appreciated the multidisciplinary nature of the team, the connection with the local community and viewed the team as highly skilled. ‚ÄúMy knowledge of it is that it was a really great team and delivered a really good service and was incredibly responsive. I think what it has to do is it needs to link into those treatment and care services. It can‚Äôt just sit on its own, it can‚Äôt just be its own thing. It has to link into that wider system to add value to it and so that it can add value to the treatment and care. I think if that was to happen it would be really, really great.‚Äù (G23, External stakeholder) ‚ÄúAgain, it is probably like that where we are looking at the health needs through addictions. They are getting a better service because these guys would just not go to their own GP. But we are looking after their health and obviously Phoenix guys really know their stuff about wounds, all that kind of stuff. They, I think, may become a gateway for a trust for us to then go to traditional health provider.‚Äù (GS19, External stakeholder) Internal stakeholders noted strong working relationships within the PHOENIx team, highlighting the importance of this collaboration for effective service delivery. ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs my job so aye, I love coming into my work, I love doing what I do and working with people who care, you know? So there‚Äôs not a day‚Ä¶but I mean, we have some tough days in here, don‚Äôt get me wrong, you know, we have some tough days. Aye. But there‚Äôs good days as well, and no matter how tough a day, we can always make it better the next day. And working with people that are all aligned and on the same page, want to do the same thing, it‚Äôs great. Aye.‚Äù (GS22, Internal stakeholder) Stakeholders observed positive relationships developing between the PHOENIx team and participants, recognising this as a key factor in the intervention‚Äôs success. It was recognised that relationship building with participants can take time, highlighting the need for longer term interventions. The building of a consistent and trusting relationship was important to internal stakeholders. ‚ÄúI think that could do wonders really, because a lot of it is building the rapport and the relationship with somebody, getting that trust, you know, and if they know where to go they can support them. And you know, that trust is there, it‚Äôs someone else that they could contact if they needed to.‚Äù (BS14, External stakeholder) ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs the sort of service they needed. So, a lot of my experience with the Phoenix project, I was very open with the participants. I spoke to them very, like, was streetwise, sort of, speaking. I spoke to them like they were people. I wasn‚Äôt, sort of, putting barriers up, I spoke to them like‚Ä¶you know, we had very open discussions. And I felt that made the rapport really well, they felt more like friends than participants and they engaged well. And that was my main aim.‚Äù (BS11, Internal stakeholder) Stakeholders identified numerous challenges in providing care to PEH, including data sharing between services, issues of engagement, continuity of care, and addressing complex, interconnected needs. ‚ÄúObviously we talk about things like data protection, those kinds of things all become a barrier because the sharing of information, because we struggle there all the time. As you can imagine, we‚Äôve got relationships with the police, got relationships with enforcement teams in the city, and we‚Äôve got relationships with the community mental health team, with the healthcare services and just the data sharing barrier is a constant thing that comes forward, so that‚Äôs one barrier.‚Äù (BS10, External stakeholder) ‚ÄúI think obviously probably one of the biggest challenges is the fact that the access to care for people who are homeless is difficult. I think we‚Äôve got to talk about it in the context of NHS care at the moment, access is difficult for everybody. Just insofar as demands are very high, there isn‚Äôt enough capacity for people. So if we‚Äôre thinking about GP practices, at the moment to get an appointment there‚Äôs a scramble at eight o‚Äôclock in the morning. You‚Äôve got to be up, you‚Äôve got to be on the phone, you‚Äôve got to get through, there‚Äôs a limited number of appointments to do it. So that very much relies on the fact that you‚Äôve got a phone, it‚Äôs working, you‚Äôre awake, blah, blah, blah.‚Äù (BS14, External stakeholder) ‚ÄúI mean the first bit of what I say relates to what I‚Äôve just said. I mean the health system‚Äôs very rigid in lots of respects and it‚Äôs not designed to deal with people who are facing homelessness or related issues. Most of the health service just isn‚Äôt set up to cope with those people. As I said, how appointments are structured etcetera. So I think standard healthcare for most people who are homeless, isn‚Äôt going to work for them the way it‚Äôs set up at the moment. So I think actually we‚Äôve got little opportunities.‚Äù (BS14, External stakeholder) While generally positive, stakeholders did identify some challenges in implementing PHOENIx, such as resource constraints and integration with existing services. ‚ÄúSome of the stuff that‚Äôs been a challenge has probably round about some of the services I spoke about wishing were here. Like, you know, maybe a lack of therapeutic mental health services, lack of easier access to rehab beds and stuff like that. So aye, that‚Äôs probably it. Aye, probably, that‚Äôs probably it.‚Äù (GS22, Internal stakeholder) Consistency of support provided at one intervention site was highlighted as a challenge. This perceived inconsistency was seen as a result of issues in the recruitment and retention of the support worker role. ‚ÄúWhere we‚Äôre now, currently, as today, we‚Äôre getting participants who are not engaging that were engaging first. And that‚Äôs because there‚Äôs been a break in the support side. But generally, obviously, there‚Äôs only so much I can do. Like, I‚Äôll call them, I‚Äôll speak to them about health, but then when they ask for updates about their housing or their benefits, I can‚Äôt answer that. That‚Äôs because, you know, we‚Äôve got that staggered, sort of, break down. We have got somebody in-house now who‚Äôs doing it, but sometimes it‚Äôs a bit too late.‚Äù (BS11, Internal stakeholder) The workload of the intervention team was also identified as a challenge, with high caseloads to manage, alongside administration for both intervention participants and the intervention itself. ‚ÄúYes, workload is heavy, aye, workload is heavy. So, it‚Äôs 25 patients, well, we‚Äôre not seeing them all the time, but weekly contact with at least 20 is a lot, aye, it‚Äôs a lot. And sometimes, it‚Äôs half days, whole days, with one patient, trying to get things sorted for them, where they overdose, or whatever.‚Äù (GS21, Internal stakeholder) ‚ÄúNo. The only aspect that I didn‚Äôt like about working in the team was just doing the paperwork and the data after the study. Just, you know, going back through and collating all the information, that was brutal, man. Six weeks or something in the office, day after day, just, you know, collating all the data and aye, aye, that‚Äôs not‚Ä¶I work here to work on the frontline, to be out, you know, working with people, and so being stuck in an office. But that‚Äôs the only thing I‚Äôve not liked about working with the team.‚Äù (GS22, Internal stakeholder) Stakeholders viewed PHOENIx as aligning closely with what they considered optimal care for PEH, particularly in its holistic, person-centred approach. Both internal and external stakeholders considered effective partnership working to be important to providing optimal care to PEH. ‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm very health focused, but actually homelessness is a health issue, there are health implications, but actually it‚Äôs a social issue. Those services need to have strong links with housing teams and all these other things, to get it right. I think it‚Äôs about people who commission the service and people who work in the service, understanding the complex nature of it. Plucking somebody from the street and giving them a house isn‚Äôt going to necessarily work straightaway. Some people haven‚Äôt lived in a house for a long time. We also put people‚Ä¶we have a higher expectation of them than we do of ourselves. If I rent a property I‚Äôm not given this list of rules of what I can and can‚Äôt do. I‚Äôm not scrutinised. Yes, I‚Äôm sure my agreement would say you can‚Äôt use illegal drugs on the property, you can‚Äôt do this. But no-one‚Äôs going to come and check.‚Äù (BS14, External stakeholder) ‚ÄúFor optimal care. They need a holistic approach. I think what we offer, in terms of the Phoenix team, is looking at all aspects of their care, and then trying to narrow it down to, what are your priorities at this moment in time, but also, putting those other issues that are identified on the backburner, so that eventually, you can come and try and deal with them when they‚Äôre in a better place. I suppose it‚Äôs about realising that you‚Äôre working with people who are using drugs for a reason, and you have to acknowledge that and work around it, and I suppose that‚Äôs a big challenge for us.‚Äù (GS21, Internal Stakeholder) Stakeholders saw PHOENIx as playing a unique and valuable role in the care landscape for PEH, bridging gaps between different services and providing continuity of care. Work or tasks carried out by the PHOENIx team include social/wellbeing support, management of health conditions (including addictions) and financial and benefit support. ‚ÄúThe one or two that needed‚Ä¶like, were underweight, I prescribed them Fortisip. But other than that, we‚Äôve not really had to do anything. It has, like I was saying to you, I did do a lot, but it was more, like, social prescribing, like signposting them to housing, or food banks, or, you know, benefits. And it wasn‚Äôt a case where‚Ä¶initially when I came in, I thought it was going to be a lot of patients who were going to be mentally unwell, who were going to be physically unwell.‚Äú (BS11, Internal Stakeholder) The PHOENIx team also provided support with navigating and referring to other services that might be perceived to be previously too complex for those with significant and complex needs. ‚ÄúIf any social aspect is needed you can get the referral process started, you can give them your number, you can give them regular updates or signpost them. So the patient actually feels like they‚Äôre being listened to, rather than being, sort of, pushed back and just a number in a list.‚Äù (BS11, Internal stakeholder) Stakeholders highlighted several positive aspects of PHOENIx, including its flexibility, holistic approach, and association with well-known or trusted organisations. ‚ÄúI think the visits, like the team going and visiting people, aye, well, I think the aspect that I like about it is it‚Äôs what‚Äôs needed. So, a lot of people that we provide support to find it difficult to engage with appointments and coming to, you know, certain places at certain times. So the team goes there. You know, the team will go there and if they don‚Äôt get somebody on one day they‚Äôll try again, you know, they‚Äôll keep trying, they‚Äôll keep going back. They might not link in straight away but, you know, they‚Äôll just keep‚Ä¶our motto‚Äôs keep chipping away. So just keep going back and then just gradually, slowly, slowly build up that relationship.‚Äù (GS22, Internal stakeholder) While generally positive, stakeholders did suggest some potential improvements for future iterations of PHOENIx. Streamlined data collection, larger teams with smaller caseloads, more locations and longer-term support were all suggested. Data collection was seen as burdensome to team members, particularly alongside managing a large caseload. ‚ÄúI also think that we really need to look at what data we‚Äôre collecting. Because it‚Äôs a feasibility trial, the data is‚Ä¶some of it, I feel, was irrelevant.‚Äù (BS9, Internal stakeholder) ‚ÄúSo, I don‚Äôt really know what the optimal caseload‚Ä¶and it would probably vary depending on what was going on for, you know, different people within that caseload. But I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre probably looking at 16 maybe, an optimal caseload, as opposed to 25. So that‚Äôs probably the only thing that I would say would benefit changing.‚Äù (GS21, Internal stakeholder) Stakeholders agreed that community pharmacy was an appropriate setting for the intervention, however, some stakeholders suggested different geographical locations, including those outside of city centres to reduce geographical barriers. ‚ÄúI think that Phoenix research needs to be done in a few locations. I know we‚Äôve got Glasgow and Birmingham but I‚Äôve previously worked in Manchester and Liverpool and they are 30 miles apart [sic] from each other, they do things completely differently to each other. I think it might have changed slightly now. And they have the same level of chaos that goes on around partnerships and around relationships with stakeholders, and the same level of chaos from service users because they are just like Birmingham, the same kind of city where people just move to, you know, and start again. Homeless community right through to professionals, you know, they are cities that are constantly changing.‚Äù (BS10, External stakeholder) ‚ÄúSo I think just different pockets of the country where you‚Äôve got those big urban cities like Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and Birmingham, versus some of those more rural Devon, Gloucestershire kind of scenarios, and Worcestershire as well, there‚Äôs a massive homeless problem in Worcestershire but it‚Äôs all quite hidden, and I think from the perspective of research, it might be beneficial to tap into some of those areas and just see the disparity and the differences between town to town, city to city.‚Äù (BS10, External stakeholder) Longer-term support was also suggested for a future trial of PHOENIx. ‚ÄúMaybe we just need longer, we need longer time. We need, probably, smaller caseload to really get at it, just a little bit smaller, but I think that vwould work out, and more time, more time. If we had longer time for the thing, I‚Äôm sure we could see different‚Ä¶maybe slightly different results [‚Ä¶]‚Äù (GS21, Internal stakeholder) Stakeholders identified potential barriers to scaling up PHOENIx, including resource constraints, support and buy-in from policy makers, and intervention staffing. Funding was identified as the primary barrier to a future trial of the intervention. Alongside the removal or reduction in existing services, there is a perceived lack of buy-in from funders or other publicly funded services. Improving services that support PEH are perceived not to be a public priority. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs going to be funding. Funding‚Äôs going to be a big problem, whether you get the funding to see the whole project through. If it‚Äôs on a larger scale, like I said, it‚Äôll be over a larger period of time and you will probably see participants getting housed.‚Äù (BS11, Internal stakeholder) ‚ÄúThe Government aren‚Äôt really invested in tackling the issue, because at the heart of all, or nearly all health inequalities, is poverty. If you eliminate poverty most of health inequalities work wouldn‚Äôt need to be done.‚Äù (BS14, External stakeholder) The staffing of the intervention roles is also seen as a barrier to future implementation. In particular, the support worker role had a significant recruitment and retention challenge. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs money, it‚Äôs always money. So, prescribers are expensive, support workers are seen as cheap, but because they‚Äôre so cheap, the turnover in staff is incredibly high, which means that people don‚Äôt have stable support, essentially, they don‚Äôt see the same support worker for years and years. It might be that they‚Ä¶some people‚Ä¶I spoke to one person yesterday whose support worker left the week that they moved into the hostel, and they‚Äôre still not‚Ä¶two weeks later, they‚Äôve still not been assigned anyone, so they have no idea what they‚Äôre doing. So, if money‚Ä¶if there was more money there to actually pay for these services, and also, more money to pay support workers a decent wage, so they‚Äôre more motivated to stay longer at the services, I think that would make the world of difference. The cost of having someone who can prescribe is‚Ä¶I mean, I‚Ä¶.it would save money, I believe, in the long run, but it‚Äôs very difficult to prove.‚Äù (BS9, Internal stakeholder). This study shows that participants perceived the PHOENIx Community Pharmacy intervention, as distinctive, comprehensive, consistent, and caring. The intervention‚Äôs success appears to lie in its ability to combine practical support with emotional care, delivered through a reliable and trusting relationship between participants and the PHOENIx team. Participants had a clear understanding of how PHOENIx differs from usual care, particularly in its holistic approach and the continuity of care provided. Engagement was facilitated by the team‚Äôs consistent presence and their ability to address both a wide range of practical and emotional needs that enables participants to engage more effectively with their care. While there were some limitations in the team‚Äôs power to effect certain changes, it was clear that people valued the nature of the long-term support provided. Concerns expressed about the intervention ending underscores its perceived importance in participants‚Äô lives and suggests a need for consideration of how such support can be sustained over time. These findings indicate that the PHOENIx Community Pharmacy intervention has successfully engaged this underserved population, providing a model of care that participants find accessible, comprehensive, and supportive. However, they also point to areas for potential improvement, particularly in terms of the scope of the team‚Äôs authority and the duration of support provided. Stakeholders‚Äô perspectives on the PHOENIx Community Pharmacy intervention reveal a generally positive view of the intervention‚Äôs potential to improve care for PEH. They recognise its unique role in addressing gaps in current service provision and appreciate its holistic, flexible approach. However, they also identify challenges, particularly around resources and scalability, that should be addressed for future implementation and expansion of the intervention. The holistic approach of PHOENIx, addressing both health and social needs, and providing practical and emotional support was particularly valued by participants and recognised by stakeholders as aligning closely with optimal care for this population. This finding supports previous research emphasising the importance of integrated care models for PEH, who often face multiple, complex challenges that span health and social domains [39]. Participants described a wide range of practical assistance, from medication management to help with benefits applications, which addressed many of the barriers to healthcare access often faced by PEH [40]. Importantly, this practical support was coupled with emotional care, which participants found equally valuable. This holistic approach aligns with calls for trauma-informed practice for PEH, recognising the complex interplay between physical health, mental health, and social circumstances in this population [40,41]. However, the perceived lack of power in certain areas, as noted by some participants, suggests that there may be systemic barriers that limit the intervention‚Äôs ability to fully address all needs. This highlights the importance of considering broader structural factors and potential policy changes when developing interventions for PEH [42]. The relational aspects of the PHOENIx Community Pharmacy intervention emerged as a crucial factor in its success. Participants valued the consistent and reliable nature of their interactions with the PHOENIx team, which fostered trust and encouraged ongoing engagement. This finding is consistent with previous research highlighting the importance of trusting relationships in healthcare for PEH [43]. Stakeholders also recognised the strength of these relationships, both within the PHOENIx team and between the team and participants. The multidisciplinary nature of the team, combining pharmacist expertise with third sector support, was seen as a particular strength. This supports the growing body of evidence suggesting that multidisciplinary, collaborative approaches are most effective in addressing the complex needs of PEH [40]. The emphasis on building and maintaining relationships through consistent contact and follow-up addresses a key challenge in providing care to PEH, who often struggle with continuity of care due to their transient circumstances or exclusion from services [14]. The success of PHOENIx in this area suggests that its model of persistent and assertive outreach could be valuable for other services seeking to engage this population [44]. Both participants and stakeholders identified challenges in the implementation of PHOENIx, particularly around resources and integration with existing services. These challenges are common in the implementation of complex interventions and highlight the need for careful planning and adequate resourcing when scaling up such interventions [45]. Existing services may be required to change and become more flexible around appointments or move to addressing the persons wider needs during consultations rather than focussing on single problems or conditions. Stakeholders recognised the potential of PHOENIx to improve care delivery for PEH, particularly through its flexible, outreach-based model. The intervention‚Äôs success in engaging individuals who had a history of low care engagement was seen as a significant strength, addressing a key challenge in providing care to this population. However, the concern expressed by participants about the intervention ending highlights the ongoing, long-term nature of support needed by many PEH. This raises important questions about the sustainability of such intensive interventions and the need for long-term funding and support [38], ergo the need for definitive trials to demonstrate impact and cost effectiveness of new services in the current fiscal climate. Some components of the pilot intervention created challenges for delivery that should be taken into consideration for any future iterations. The study questionnaire administered to all participants was perceived to be irrelevant in portions, and onerous to complete for both patients and internal stakeholders. A redesign of the study questionnaire could help to reduce any unnecessary data collection and reduce the length and therefore duration of the questionnaire for both participants and researchers. Internal stakeholders also indicated that the lack of trial support, including trial data management, had a considerable impact on the workload involved in implementing the intervention. At both sites, the trial data management was primarily undertaken by the pharmacists. Any future trial should aim to provide additional administrative support to reduce the workload on the pharmacist and refocus the role on providing clinical support to participants. A significant challenge to the delivery of consistent support to participants was the high staff turnover in the support worker role. The issues around recruitment and retention, while only at one site, had a knock-on effect on other members of the research team. Future trials should aim to bolster this position, perhaps aiming to employ more than one support worker to ensure consistency for participants during periods of absence, improve overall retention and reduce the caseload of support workers. Recruitment and retention of trial participants should be considered to ensure representativeness of the population. PHOENIx participants represent 0.6% of Glasgow‚Äôs homeless population [46], and 0.3% of PEH in Birmingham [47]. A full RCT should aim to improve recruitment of study participants. This could be accomplished by garnering greater buy-in from other support services and third sector organisations, as well as ensuring that voucher incentivisation for participant follow-up is increased with inflation or the cost of living. The findings of this study have several implications for practice and policy in the area of healthcare for PEH. PHOENIx provided the opportunity to evaluate the intervention as an RCT, which is uncommon in homelessness health research. The trial represents a valuable step for homelessness health research methodology, and a unique contribution to the area of study. The intervention delivers integrated health and social care for PEH, supporting the delivery of NICE Guidelines (NG214). As identified by stakeholders, holistic, integrated care is key to optimal delivery of services to PEH. The success of PHOENIx‚Äôs comprehensive approach supports the need for services that address both generalist health and social needs in an integrated manner. Although the integrated approach is not unique to PHOENIx, the importance of consistent, trusting relationships in engaging PEH highlighted in this trial suggests that services should prioritise continuity of care and invest in building long-term relationships with this population. The combination of generalist healthcare expertise (pharmacist) and social care knowledge (third sector worker) was a key strength of PHOENIx, supporting the value of multidisciplinary approaches. The use of a pharmacist and support worker makes the intervention distinct from other interventions in the research area, however it is possible that the intervention could be delivered by other NHS staff to support scalability of the intervention, e.g., a healthcare support worker, working in tandem with a third sector support worker. The perceived lack of power of PHOENIx staff in certain areas highlights the need for broader policy changes to enable widening of roles in order that systemic barriers to care are addressed on outreach, to further build trust between PHOENIx and PEH. The perspectives captured are those of individuals who engaged with the intervention and only a small number of usual care participants. Future research could address these limitations by including a wider range of perspectives, including more usual care participants to allow for greater comparison of experience between groups. Further, some intervention participants were interviewed at an early stage of the intervention so the impact of the intervention could be difficult to assess. Longitudinal studies, or ethnographic methods could explore the long-term impacts of the intervention and the sustainability of its effects. The PHOENIx Community pharmacy intervention was deemed acceptable and perceived to have many perceived positive impacts. There is a high level of support for the PHOENIx intervention from both intervention participants and health care professionals/ stakeholders suggesting scope for progression to a full-scale trial. The PHOENIx intervention represents a promising approach to providing comprehensive, accessible healthcare to PEH. Its success in engaging this underserved population and addressing complex needs through a holistic, relationship-based approach offers valuable lessons for the improvement of services for PEH. The success of the engagement with this population could offer a guide to interventions for other underserved population beyond PEH. However, challenges around resources, scalability, and long-term sustainability of PHOENIx need to be addressed. As healthcare systems struggle with the challenge of complex needs of PEH, and recruitment crises among clinical professionals, models such as PHOENIx offer a template for more effective, person-centred care that holds promise for improving health outcomes for this vulnerable population.

Large language models are increasingly used by private investors seeking financial advice. The current paper examines the potential of these models to perpetuate investment biases and affect the economic security of individuals at scale. We provide a systematic assessment of how large language models used for investment advice shape the portfolio risks of private investors. We offer a comprehensive model of large language model investment advice risk, examining five key dimensions of portfolio risks (geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk). We demonstrate across four studies that large language models used for investment advice induce increased portfolio risks across all five risk dimensions, and that a range of debiasing interventions only partially mitigate these risks. Our findings show that large language models exhibit similar ‚Äúcognitive‚Äù biases as human investors, reinforcing existing investment biases inherent in their training data. These findings have important implications for private investors, policymakers, artificial intelligence developers, financial institutions, and the responsible development of large language models in the financial sector.

The funder had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. The landscape of professional advice is experiencing a profound transformation driven by artificial intelligence (AI). In domains ranging from healthcare and legal services to education and finance, millions of individuals are increasingly turning to AI-powered advisory systems [1‚Äì5]. Within financial services specifically, this shift is exemplified by the sharp rise of robo-advisors [6‚Äì9]. These fully automated platforms assess people‚Äôs financial goals, evaluate their risk tolerance, and manage entire investment portfolios without any human intervention [6]. By democratizing access to financial advice, robo-advisors enable individuals who previously did not meet minimum investment thresholds to participate in wealth-building, potentially reducing global wealth inequality [7,10,11]. Beyond complex tasks such as managing an entirely financial portfolio, these technologies can also assist users with basic personal finance tasks such as budgeting and expense tracking, offering accessible financial guidance for everyday decisions [12]. However, despite these advantages, the first wave of such AI advisors across various domains has faced criticism for failing to provide adequately personalized recommendations that align with people‚Äôs individual needs and expectations [7]. In healthcare, AI diagnostic systems have demonstrated limitations in accounting for patient-specific factors [13], while in education, adaptive learning platforms often failed to accommodate diverse learning styles [14]. In response to these limitations, a new class of AI-driven, cross-domain advisory systems is emerging, leveraging large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT to provide highly tailored, personalized advice to individuals [15]. LLMs have demonstrated exceptional natural language understanding capabilities [16‚Äì18] and the ability to generate such personalized advice [19], potentially addressing key limitations of traditional advisory systems (see also [20] for a recent meta-analysis and increased adoption rates of AI since the emergence of LLMs). In finance specifically, LLMs exhibit exceptionally strong financial literacy [21], enabling them to analyze vast amounts of unstructured financial data in real time [22]. This capability enhances decision-making in areas such as trading and risk modeling as they have been shown to even reliably extract market sentiment to predict stock movements [22,23]. Beyond their technical proficiency, LLMs also demonstrate above-average emotional intelligence, with GPT-4 surpassing 89% of humans [24]. Such emotional intelligence is particularly crucial, as trust plays a fundamental role in financial decision making, and the relationship between private investors and their financial advisors strongly influences the actual adoption of financial advice [25]. Reflecting this trend, a recent study found that 22% of UK private investors with over ¬£10,000 in investments reported using ChatGPT for financial advice, with 75% expressing confidence in its reliability [26] and similar rates have been reported in trusting ChatGPT for advice in other domains such as healthcare [27,28]. However, this growing reliance on LLMs for personalized advice raises a critical question: Can LLMs provide truly reliable financial advice, or do they reinforce already existing human investment biases? The current research examines whether especially LLM-generated financial advice is truly reliable and to what extent it exposes private investors to disproportionate risks. With millions of users starting to employ LLMs to receive financial advice, the belief that LLMs can deliver sound financial advice has the potential to shape not only individual investment decisions but also broader market dynamics. If LLM-driven advisory services systematically reinforce investment biases, they could introduce not only idiosyncratic risks for single individuals‚Äîparticularly those without access to human financial advisors‚Äîbut systemic investment risks across financial markets at scale [29]. The potential risks of such an overreliance on LLM-generated financial advice might mirror similar adverse effects already documented in other domains, such as medical misdiagnoses resulting from AI-healthcare tools [30], biased legal outcomes from algorithmic decision systems [31,32], and educational disparities perpetuated by AI learning platforms that fail to address diverse student needs [14]. While these cross-domain risks are increasingly surfaced and recognized, a systematic empirical investigation of how LLMs specifically influence financial decision-making remains scarce. To address this critical gap on the financial implications of LLM-generated advice, the current work presents a series of large-scale LLM experiments systematically prompting three major LLMs (Open AI‚Äôs ChatGPT, Google‚Äôs Gemini, and Microsoft‚Äôs Copilot) with varying complexity and investor profiles (e.g., young, risk-seeking investors to older, conservative investors). We evaluate the impact of LLM-generated advice on private investors‚Äô financial portfolios using a comprehensive investment risk framework spanning five key domains (see Conceptual Framework section for details; i.e., geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk). Across four studies, we demonstrate that LLM-generated investment advice systematically increases portfolio risks for private investors across all five dimensions, with negative implications for risk-adjusted portfolio returns, and we further show that (prompt-based) debiasing interventions only partially mitigate these risks. These findings offer four key contributions: First, our studies demonstrate that LLMs exhibit systematic investment biases similar to those of human advisors, suggesting that AI systems may broadly reinforce existing human biases across advisory domains. Second, we provide a comprehensive framework for assessing five essential types of risks induced by LLM-generated financial advice, establishing a methodology that could be adapted for other domains as well. Third, our findings inform private investors seeking AI assistance, emphasizing the importance of a more critical evaluation when following fully automated recommendations by LLMs. Finally, this research establishes a generalizable framework for stakeholders‚Äîincluding regulators, institutions, and technology developers‚Äîto test and validate LLM-generated recommendations in the financial sector. In what follows, we first develop a comprehensive conceptual framework explaining why and how LLMs may produce risky financial advice. We then present four studies that test this framework. Finally, we discuss the broader theoretical and regulatory implications of our findings, offering insights for investors, public policy, FinTech innovators, financial institutions, and academics concerned with the evolving role of LLMs in financial advisory services. We first provide a focused review of recent work on biases in LLMs and examine how two specific types of biases in the data generating process, namely geographical and language biases, may shape the type of financial advice received by LLMs. Next, we develop a set of predictions on how these biases are further reinforced by two LLM-specific biases‚Äîavailability and recency biases. Table 1 presents a focused review of the literature documenting a set of key biases of LLMs documented in the literature. The key insight across prior work is that these models tend to replicate implicit biases found in their training data [33]. For instance, LLMs have been found to exhibit gender biases, such as the association of certain professions (e.g., doctors or lawyers) more frequently with men than women (gender bias); racial biases, displaying systematically more positive sentiment toward certain demographic groups (e.g., favoring left-wing over right-wing perspectives); and even cultural biases, associating specific religious groups with more negative traits (e.g., linking Muslims with terrorism, extremism, and violence). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.t001 Among these documented biases, two are particularly relevant in the context of financial advisory‚Äîgeographical and language biases. LLMs tend to perform better in languages that are overrepresented in their training data [44], and they reflect geographic biases due to disproportionate media coverage of specific regions [41]. Thus, we predict that these fundamental biases shape the financial advice private investors receive. We refer to these biases collectively as biases in the training data generation (Fig 1). We argue that these inherent data generation biases are further reinforced by two LLM-specific biases: availability bias and recency bias. Availability bias describes LLMs‚Äô tendency to favor information that is more easily accessible [45]. In the context of LLM-generated financial advice, this suggests that regions and companies with greater representation in the training data are likely to be more disproportionately recommended in LLM-generated investment advice. Recency bias refers to placing disproportionate weight on recent events compared to historical data [35]. For financial advice, this could result in LLM-generated recommendations that overemphasize more recent market trends. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g001 Fig 1 summarizes our conceptual model, illustrating how biases in the data generation process are reinforced by LLM-specific biases (availability and recency biases) to drive subsequent investment risks (see next section for details; i.e., geographical cluster, sector cluster, trend chasing, active investment allocation, and total expense risk). In this research, we examine five distinct types of investment risks. First, we refer to geographical cluster risk as the extent to which the received investment advice puts a greater emphasis on investments of US-based equities [46,47]. As alluded to earlier, we expect that due to the training data stemming especially from English language content [48] and the fact that the US as one of the largest and most developed economies in the world with a strong presence in media reports [49], potentially increases the likelihood to produce a high concentration with US based investments. The sector cluster risk captures the extent to which investments are clustered in single sectors. We expect that due to the strong media coverage of, for example, sectors such as technology or consumer staples compared to other sectors that are of similar (or even greater) economic weight in terms of contribution to the GDP (such as transportation or service sectors; [50,51]) leads to a potential over-investment in such sectors. Next, we assess an LLM‚Äôs trend chasing risk as the extent to which investments tend to follow more recent events. Such trend chasing can lead to buying decisions when prices are high and selling them when prices are low due to herding behavior [52]. Trend chasing is also important from a macroeconomic standpoint as trend chasing can amplify market bubbles and in turn, increase the overall volatility in a financial market [53]. Due to LLMs‚Äô already documented recency bias, we expect such trend chasing in LLM-generated financial advice. As a fourth risk type, we will assess the active investment allocation risk as the extent to which investors are invested in actively (vs. passively) managed assets. Such investment strategies (and their associated asset classes) seek to outperform a financial market (or benchmark) by selecting and investing in specific equities [54,55]. Allocating a higher share into actively managed assets in an attempt to ‚Äúbeat the market‚Äù is generally associated with a greater volatility risk compared to a broad, passive market exposure [56]. We therefore expect an overinvestment in actively managed assets as the training data likely includes references to specific stocks, active trading strategies, or even stock picking recommendations that are prevalent in financial media, investment forums, and advisory content, where discussions about potential market-beating investments tend to receive more attention than passive investment approaches [57]. Finally, we will assess the total expense risk as the extent of the overall costs of owning an investment, including all fees related to general administrative costs, custodian fees, as well as management fees (in the case of actively managed assets). While related, the total expense risk is distinct from active investment allocation risk as the expense risk captures the impact of reducing net returns through investment fees, and not all active investment approaches incur excessive fees or expenses [58]. For example, an actively managed ETF (short for ‚ÄúExchange-Traded Fund‚Äù) such as the Schwab US Dividend ETF has a lower TER (Total Expense Ratio: the TER reflects the total costs associated with managing a fund, including management fees and administrative expenses expressed as percentage of assets invested) compared to the passive Vanguard All World portfolio ETF (TERSCHD = .06% vs. TERVT = .07%). Table 2 summarizes all of our key risk measures of our conceptual model, their definitions, why they are important from an investment standpoint, and their formal calculation. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.t002 Our experimental paradigm employs a large-scale experimental setting using a 3 (risk tendency: low/ medium/ high) x 3 (age: 15/ 30/ 50) x 3 (LLM: ChatGPT/ Copilot/ Gemini) full factorial design. The first two experimental factors (risk tendency and age) provide our baseline experimental paradigm, representing private investors‚Äô self-stated risk-taking tendency and their objective risk exposure. Older (vs. younger) investors should generally invest in less risky assets due to their limited ability to equalize negative returns over the investment horizon [59‚Äì62]. Given that LLMs are expected to personalize financial advice [19], this research investigates how they adjust financial recommendations based on such investor risk-taking tendencies and investor age. The third experimental factor (type of LLM) addresses potential sampling issues due to LLM-specific performance differences. Our experimental paradigm resulted in 27 experimental conditions, which we each prompted 10 times to account for single (and sometimes less common) LLM responses [63]. Thus, we performed 270 prompts in total. We accessed ChatGPT 3.5 via OpenAI‚Äôs API [64], Copilot via the EdgeGPT Python package [65], and Gemini via the Bard API Python package [66]. We automatically queried these predominant LLMs in the marketplace to provide us with financial advice. The specific baseline prompt template with our experimental variations across all studies was performed as follows: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a <15-year-old/ 30-year-old/ 50-year-old> looking to invest $10,000. I‚Äôm <not willing to take too many risks/ willing to take some risks/ willing to take a lot of risks> with my investment, and I‚Äôm hoping for some advice on what products I should consider investing in and how much I should allocate to each. Can you provide me with some recommendations? Please provide me with a table with the type of the investment, the name, the ticker symbol, and the amount I should invest.‚Äù. LLMs responded to these prompts with financial advice that included a table of specific investment recommendations (see Fig 2 for an exemplary investment advice by ChatGPT for a 30-year-old investor with a high risk-taking tendency). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g002 To ensure open science research practices [67], all of our code is documented and available on GitHub along with all datasets (https://github.com/ibtPhilipp/biasedEchoes). The next section details how each LLM response was further processed, how each key measure of interest was computed from the LLM‚Äôs unstructured text response, and how we analyzed the resulting measures. As summarized in Fig 3 the financial advice received by each LLM (see preceding section) was parsed and further augmented with additional financial data. We query ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini for financial advice, parse the investment portfolio recommendations, and augment them with data from Yahoo Finance, Refinitiv Eikon, and FRED (‚ÄúFederal Reserve Economic Data‚Äù repository) to assess the investment risks, financial performance, and language style of the received financial advice. We query ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini for financial advice, parse the investment portfolio recommendations, and augment them with data from Yahoo Finance, Refinitiv Eikon, and FRED (‚ÄúFederal Reserve Economic Data‚Äù repository) to assess the investment risks, financial performance, and language style of the received financial advice. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g003 First, we extracted the specific investment recommendations from the received unstructured LLM financial advice by performing regular expression splits. We extracted the type of investment such as ‚ÄúStocks‚Äù, the name of the investment option such as ‚ÄúApple Inc.‚Äù, the ticker symbol such as ‚ÄúAAPL‚Äù, and the amount in USD such as $3,000 for each position of the investment portfolio recommendation contained in the received financial advice. In case of an invalid LLM financial advice (i.e., non-parseable format or a missing allocation amount) we replaced the LLM response with a new one (i.e., re-prompting the model for the failed response). Second, we then further augmented the parsed investment portfolio recommendations with additional labeled financial data from Yahoo Finance (via the yfinance Python package [68]) and the Refinitiv Eikon database [69]. All investment portfolio positions were augmented with their asset type and equities were augmented by their corresponding sector utilizing Yahoo Finance. For portfolio positions with valid tickers (i.e., equities, ETFs, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies) we fetched price data from Yahoo Finance over a consistent 18-month period (1 July 2023‚Äì1 January 2025) following our initial data collection. Next, the investment portfolio positions were resolved to equity granularity level using holding data and augmented by geolocation and sector data from Refinitiv Eikon. In Study 3, investment portfolio positions were further augmented by their ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) score (ranging from 0: poor ESG performance to 100: excellent ESG performance). ETF and mutual fund investment portfolio positions were augmented by their TER and management approach (i.e., active vs. passive). To establish a risk-free baseline, we queried the risk-free market rate (i.e., 10-year US treasury bill) from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis online database FRED [70]. All this additional labeled financial data was then used to assess the investment risks, financial performance, and language style of the received LLM financial advice. Lastly, we fetched geolocation, sector, TER, holding, and price data for our benchmark (see section Benchmark) using exactly the same approach. We assessed the financial performance of the LLM financial advice utilizing the retrieved prices data and risk-free rate. The uniform time window across all retrieved data samples ensures comparability of the financial performance. We computed the recommended investment portfolio‚Äôs cumulative return, volatility (portfolio return standard deviation), and annualized risk-adjusted relative returns (annualized Sharpe ratio). Portfolio positions lacking a ticker and price data (e.g., savings or defined contribution accounts) were coded as zero return and zero volatility (only 7% of all observations). We utilized a zero-shot classification model (Facebook‚Äôs BART-large trained on the MultiNLI dataset; [71]) to assess the presence of explicit explanations about how the portfolio was constructed, the degree of assertiveness, and the presence of disclaimer notes. We specified the model for a single classification task and defined the possible classes of ‚Äúexplanations‚Äù and ‚Äúno explanations‚Äù for the presence of explicit explanations, ‚Äúassertive‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-assertive‚Äù for assertiveness, and ‚Äúdisclaimer‚Äù and ‚Äúno disclaimer‚Äù for the presence of disclaimer notes. We retrieved the probabilities for each characteristic. We contrast the received financial advice relative to one of the most commonly used financial benchmark indices [72]. Specifically, we contrast all recommendations received by each LLM relative to the Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund (VT) ETF. This ETF represents a basket of securities that track the underlying index FTSE Global All Cap. Notably, the FTSE Global All Cap index serves as a strategic benchmark for the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global, which holds 1.5% of the world‚Äôs listed companies [73]. In short, this benchmark represents a common, broad, and diversified investment portfolio and has been used in prior work as well [72]. As with the data augmentation strategy, this data was queried using Yahoo Finance and the Refinitiv Eikon database. Investment risks. In what follows, we first analyze the multivariate effects of LLM type (Study 1) and experimental condition (Studies 2a, 2b, & 3), risk-taking tendency, and age on investment risk using a MANOVA. To assess each type of investment risk in detail, we conducted individual one-way ANOVAs, followed by planned contrasts using Tukey‚Äôs HSD correction for multiple comparisons. In Study 1, we first conducted one-way ANOVAs with individual investment risk types as the dependent variable and LLM as the predictor. We then performed t-tests comparing each LLM to the benchmark investment risk value. This helped determine whether the type of LLM influences investment risks and whether it outperforms or underperforms the benchmark. Next, we conducted additional ANOVAs with investment risk as the response variable, examining risk-taking tendency and age as predictors. For Studies 2a, 2b, and 3, we first conducted t-tests comparing investment risks between conditions and the contrast relative to the benchmark index. This allowed us to assess whether the intervention influenced the individual investment risk exposure and how it compared to the benchmark. Due to the large number of contrasts and comparisons, we report only theoretically or practically important contrasts directly in the manuscript, while the full range of contrasts is reported in detail across consecutive tables for each study in S1 Appendix. To enhance readability in the remainder of the paper, all specific effect sizes and test contrasts are reported in these tables as well. For a comprehensive overview of portfolio position exclusion criteria and robustness checks, see S4 Appendix. Financial Performance Analysis. To assess the impact of different LLMs on portfolio performance, we conducted a series of mixed linear model regressions with the portfolio cumulative return and Sharpe ratio respectively as the dependent variable. This approach was chosen to account for both fixed effects (i.e., LLMs, temporal trends, and individual characteristics) and random effects (group-level variations across portfolios). The fixed effects included the LLM (ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini) to assess whether specific models influence the return or Sharpe ratio. Additionally, we controlled for temporal trends by including monthly timestamps. This enabled us to assess how the portfolio returns and Sharpe ratios evolved over time. We also incorporated individual differences in risk-taking tendency (low, medium, and high) and age (15-, 30-, and 50-year-olds) to explore potential interactions between the LLM and risk-related variables. By introducing these predictors, we aimed to determine whether returns or Sharpe ratios varied systematically on risk-related variables and whether different LLMs performed better for specific investor types. This approach allowed us to isolate the effect of LLMs while accounting for risk-related variables and temporal trends. Language style analysis. First, we calculated a series of one-way ANOVAs and follow-up contrasts with Tukey HSD correction for multiple comparisons for each characteristic (presence of explanations, assertiveness, and presence of disclaimer notes) as the dependent and the LLM as the independent variable. This allowed us to assess whether LLMs deviate in their language style when communicating the financial advice. Next, we conducted one-way ANOVAs and Tukey HSD corrected contrasts with each characteristic as the dependent and risk-taking tendency and age respectively as independent variables. These additional ANOVAs were conducted to test whether LLMs change their language style depending on an individual‚Äôs risk-taking tendency (e.g., very assertive language for high risk-taking individuals) and age. In Study 1 we assessed the type of financial advice that private investors receive as a function of their appetite for risk (self-stated risk-taking tendency and investor age) from the most widely used LLMs (Open AI‚Äôs ChatGPT, Google‚Äôs Gemini, Microsoft‚Äôs Copilot). Study 1 employed our baseline experimental paradigm (see Methods section). A MANOVA with the investment risk types (geographical cluster, sector cluster, trend chasing, active investment allocation, and total expense risk) as the response and the LLM (ChatGPT/ Gemini/ Copilot), risk-taking tendency (low/ medium/ high), and age (15/ 30/ 50) as predictors showed significant effects of LLM type (ŒõWilks = .7, F(10, 464) = 9.20, p < .001), risk-taking tendency (ŒõWilks = .19, F(10, 464) = 60.41, p < .001), and age (ŒõWilks = .87, F(5, 232) = 6.81, p < .001). In what follows, we provide a deep dive into the results explaining the differences of individual investment risks depending on each LLM (Fig 4). (A) We find above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 269), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 269), (C) trend chasing risk (N = 270), and (D) active investment risk (N = 270). The violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the respective investment risk by LLM. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolio samples. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark. (A) We find above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 269), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 269), (C) trend chasing risk (N = 270), and (D) active investment risk (N = 270).

The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g004 Geographical & sector cluster risk. Our results show that all three LLMs revealed excessive cluster risk compared to our benchmark index. That is reflected in both an over-investment in US equities (with LLMs investing over 93% in US equities vs. 59% in the benchmark) and a higher concentration of funds in individual sectors (Fig 5). An additional concentration analysis showed that LLMs invested on average over 5% and 8% more in the already predominant technology (t(268) = 4.73, p < .001) and consumer cyclical sectors (t(268) = 8.23, p < .001) compared to the benchmark, thereby systematically increasing the sector cluster risk of the portfolio (see S2 Appendix for sector concentration details). This figure illustrates the portfolio weight by LLM type and country relative to the benchmark for the top five sectors (N = 269). This figure illustrates the portfolio weight by LLM type and country relative to the benchmark for the top five sectors (N = 269). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g005 Trend chasing risk. As shown in Fig 4:C, we find that all LLMs heavily engage in trend chasing with up to 27.92% invested in the top three equities that were traded most frequently in the past three months prior to prompting the LLMs. Consistent with our predictions, we find that all three LLMs display systematically higher trend chasing compared to the benchmark index (9%). Active investment allocation risk. We also observe systematically higher shares of actively managed investment options and stock picking. Specifically, we find that over 51% of investments were allocated into actively managed funds or single equities while the benchmark is a fully passive index-replicating ETF. Total expense risk. Finally, we observe significantly higher total expense ratios across all LLM portfolio recommendations compared to the benchmark index. Next, we conducted one-way ANOVAs with individual investment risks as the response variable and LLM type, risk-taking tendency as well as LLM type and age as predictors. Follow-up contrasts with Tukey‚Äôs HSD correction revealed a consistently higher active investment allocation risk for individuals with high (vs. low and medium) risk-taking tendencies. ChatGPT and Gemini even increased this risk for those with medium (vs. low) risk-taking tendencies. Similarly, LLMs provided financial advice with higher total expense risk for individuals with high (vs. low and medium) risk-taking tendencies. Further, ChatGPT and Copilot adjusted their recommendations for individuals with low (vs. medium and high) risk-taking tendencies, showing a significantly lower trend chasing risk ‚Äì as low as 0.67% compared to 38.18% for those with high risk-taking tendencies. Other cases showed variations in investment risks based on risk-taking tendency and age-related risk, but these contrasts did not follow a consistent trend across LLMs. However, we find that ChatGPT and Gemini show less concentration in the technology and consumer cyclical sector for low risk-taking investors and a higher share in government activities. Copilot even concentrates over 46% of funds in government activities (i.e. bond ETFs) for low (vs. medium and high) risk-taking tendency resulting again in a higher sector concentration risk. Taken together, Study 1 provides initial evidence that LLM investment advice induces a significantly enhanced investment portfolio risk across all five types of portfolio risks (geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk). Further, we find that LLMs systematically adapt the provided investment advice depending on the risk-taking tendency. Financial performance analysis. A mixed-linear model, controlling for temporal effects and using the benchmark as the baseline, revealed that Copilot exhibited significantly lower Sharpe ratios (Œ≤ = ‚àí1.14, p < .01), indicating worse risk-adjusted performance compared to the benchmark (see Fig 6). In contrast, ChatGPT (Œ≤ = ‚àí.28, p = .52) and Gemini (Œ≤ = ‚àí.12, p = .79) did not show statistically significant differences from the benchmark. Temporal effects were not significant, suggesting that the relative risk-adjusted performance of these portfolios remained stable over time but also not significantly more positive relative to the benchmark despite the additional amount of risk exposure of each LLM. The relatively strong risk-adjusted performance of ChatGPT and Gemini is likely driven by an overconcentration in the technology sector and the specific market conditions during the performance analysis period. Given the rapid growth of the technology sector‚Äîprimarily fueled by advancements in LLM technology itself‚Äîportfolios disproportionately exposed to this sector benefited from favorable market trends. The figure shows the Sharpe ratio of ChatGPT (N = 1620), Copilot (N = 1620), and Gemini (N = 1620) relative to the benchmark (N = 18) over a 1.5-year period following the initial data collection. The figure shows the Sharpe ratio of ChatGPT (N = 1620), Copilot (N = 1620), and Gemini (N = 1620) relative to the benchmark (N = 18) over a 1.5-year period following the initial data collection. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g006 However, it is crucial to highlight that risk-adjusted returns, such as the Sharpe ratio, only adjust for the level of risk reflected in return volatility. This measure does not fully capture the broader spectrum of investment risks depending on other market conditions. For example, geopolitical events may evoke additional geographical risks inherent in LLM-generated investment advice leading to increased return fluctuations. Thus, relying solely on return volatility adjusted risk measures can lead to an incomplete assessment of true investment risks inherent in financial advice. Moreover, we also observed that both the choice of LLM and its sensitivity to people‚Äôs risk tendencies significantly influenced risk-adjusted performance. Specifically, mixed-linear models controlling for temporal effects and including self-stated risk-taking and age as predictors indicated that Copilot‚Äôs risk-adjusted performance was significantly worse for investors with a low self-stated risk-taking tendency (Œ≤ = ‚àí3.13, p < .001), as well as for 30-year-olds (Œ≤ = ‚àí1.57, p < .001) and 50-year-olds (Œ≤ = ‚àí1.12, p = .01) compared to the benchmark. In summary, these findings suggest that while some LLMs may appear to perform adequately (or at least not worse compared to our benchmark) during specific market conditions, this performance is likely driven by the most recent market conditions that benefitted technology and AI investments rather than evidence of a superior investment strategy. The overconcentration in technology sectors that temporarily benefited ChatGPT and Gemini portfolios represents precisely the type of cluster risk that would expose investors to substantial losses during sector-specific downturns. Moreover, the significant underperformance of Copilot, particularly for risk-averse and middle-aged investors, reveals a concerning pattern: LLMs may be least reliable for the very demographic groups most likely to seek and follow automated financial advice. Collectively, these results indicate that LLM-generated financial advice creates a potentially disadvantageous combination of hidden risks and misleading performance indicators that could lead investors to overestimate the quality of LLM-generated recommendations while underestimating their exposure to undiversified risk factors not captured by conventional performance metrics. Language style analysis. Finally, we examined the specific language style employed across all models (see S3 Appendix for details). We utilized a zero-shot transformer model (Facebook‚Äôs BART-large trained on the MultiNLI dataset; [71]) to detect whether the investment advice offered a clear explanation or rationale (i.e., why a specific investment option should be chosen), the extent of assertiveness (i.e., how firmly the AI recommends to invest into a specific asset class), and to which extent the advice offers a disclaimer at the end of the recommendation (i.e., stating the potential risks involved with the investment). These analyses demonstrate that all recommendations offered a seemingly plausible explanation (e.g., ‚ÄúProcter & Gamble is a stable company with a long history of paying dividends. Dividend stocks provide regular income and can grow over time.‚Äù), with medium to high assertiveness (e.g., ‚ÄúConsidering your requirements, here‚Äôs a diversified investment portfolio with a breakdown of how much you should allocate to each type of investment:‚Äù), and offering a seemingly trustworthy and ‚Äúcaring‚Äù disclaimer in the recommendation (e.g., ‚ÄúRemember, these are just recommendations, and it‚Äôs crucial to do your own research or consult a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.‚Äù). Notably, and as reported in the detailed analysis in S3 Appendix, our results revealed that approximately 95% of all investment recommendations across the three LLMs contained such financial investing disclaimers, suggesting they might function as a deliberate precautionary measure implemented by LLM providers to mitigate potential liability concerns while still delivering a highly assertive financial advice that users are likely to follow despite these warnings. Robustness checks. To test whether our findings hold for most recent versions of LLMs, we automatically queried ChatGPT 4o (gpt-4o-2024-08-06) and Claude Sonnet 3.5 (claude-3‚Äì5-sonnet-20241022). We employed our baseline template prompt (see Experimental paradigm) but added instructions that the model should check that the investment recommendations add up to $10,000 and respond in JSON format for improved advice parsing (this option did not exist when we collected the initial dataset). We employed a 2 (LLM: GPT 4o/ Sonnet 3.5) x 3 (risk-taking tendency: low, medium, high) x 3 (age: 15, 30, 50) full factorial design. Following our approach in Study 1, we repeated every prompt five times to prevent a single response selection biases. We retrieved valid responses for all prompts (N = 90). Next, we augmented the financial advice received with additional labeled data and calculated the investment risks analogous to Study 1. Our results show that also the most recent LLMs at the time of this study, exhibit the same above-benchmark investment risks, with the magnitude of each risk somewhat depending on the type of LLM (Fig 7). What is consistent is that all more recent LLMs show an even more pronounced sector cluster risk (due to investing more into the predominant sectors of technology and consumer cyclicals) and a higher total expense risk. We find (A) above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 359), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 357), (C) trend chasing risk (N = 360), and (D) active investment risk (N = 270) also for current versions of LLMs. The violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the respective investment risk by LLM. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolios. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark. We find (A) above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 359), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 357), (C) trend chasing risk (N = 360), and (D) active investment risk (N = 270) also for current versions of LLMs. The violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the respective investment risk by LLM. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolios. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g007 In Study 2a we assessed whether we can alter a single risk dimension (such as avoiding management fees) without changing the other types of risks. We used a two-cell experimental design (control prompt vs. debiasing intervention prompt) with a control prompt identical to Study 1 and a debiasing intervention prompt that explicitly requested no management fees (‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to pay any management fees.‚Äù). This simple, prompt-based intervention is the only realistic alternative for private investors (most private investors will not have the luxury to fine-tune a model and test more sophisticated debiasing techniques). The baseline paradigm in both the control condition and risk debiasing condition was identical and used the same experimental setup as in Study 1 (full factorial design with 3 (risk tendency: high/ medium/ low) x 3 (age: 15/ 30/ 50); given the similar responses provided by LLMs in Study 1, we focused on ChatGPT as the most successful commercially available LLM for the remainder of the paper). A MANOVA with the investment risks (geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk) as the response and the prompting intervention (control vs. debiasing prompt), risk-taking tendency and age as predictors showed significant effects for the prompting intervention (ŒõWilks = .82, F(5, 154) = 6.6, p < .001), risk-taking tendency (ŒõWilks = .18, F(10, 308) = 41.68, p < .001), and investor age (ŒõWilks = .88, F(5, 154) = 4.31, p < .01). Despite the significant main effect of the debiasing intervention, we find that narrow debiasing only directionally reduces the TER compared to the control condition and fails to decrease it to the level of the benchmark. However, we find that the debiasing intervention moderately reduces the share of actively managed investments. Yet, we still find that over 48% of investments are allocated to actively managed funds or single equities. The narrow debiasing intervention also reduced the over-investment in US stocks and sector concentration in LLM financial advice. However, the geographical as well as sector cluster risk still remained significantly larger compared to the benchmark. The narrow debiasing intervention prompt did not reduce trend chasing, resulting in still significantly stronger trend chasing compared to the benchmark. One-way ANOVAs and planned follow-up contrasts with Tukey HSD correction with experimental condition and risk-taking tendency as well as experimental condition and age as predictor showed that the risk-taking tendency had only limited influence on investment risk changes between conditions. Specifically, our results show that the narrow debiasing intervention only significantly reduced the geographical cluster risk and active investment allocation risk for low self-stated risk-taking tendency where these risks were already the smallest compared to medium and high risk-taking tendency. These findings suggest that while simple prompt-based interventions (like requesting no management fees) can partially mitigate some investment risks, they fail to comprehensively address the full spectrum of risks present in LLM-generated financial advice. The persistence of significant geographical concentration, sector biases, and trend chasing behavior (despite a moderate reduction of actively managed funds) indicates that the systematic investment biases in LLMs are deeply embedded and relatively resistant to simple corrective measures that typical private investors might realistically employ. Financial Performance Analysis. A mixed-linear model, controlling for temporal effects and using the benchmark as a baseline revealed that the risk-adjusted performance of LLM investment advice in the control (Œ≤ = ‚àí.21, p = .19) and debiasing intervention condition (Œ≤ = ‚àí.29, p = .08) were not significantly different relative to the benchmark. Our results show that the risk-adjusted returns improved over time and were significantly lower in the first three months (Œ≤08/2023 = ‚àí2.3, p = .02; Œ≤09/2023 = ‚àí3.43, p < .01; Œ≤10/2023 = ‚àí3.29, p < .01). Furthermore, we find that especially for investors with a high (Œ≤control = ‚àí.41, p < .01; Œ≤debiased = ‚àí.43, p < .01) and low (vs. medium) risk-taking tendency (Œ≤control = ‚àí.46, p < .01; Œ≤debiased = ‚àí.40, p < .01) the risk-adjusted returns were in fact lower in both prompt conditions compared to the benchmark. Again, we also find that the risk-adjusted returns were especially lower in the short-term (Œ≤08/2023 = ‚àí2.3, p = .01; Œ≤09/2023 = ‚àí3.43, p < .001; Œ≤10/2023 = ‚àí3.29, p < .001). Finally, and similarly to Study 1, we find that 50-year-olds received investment advice with lower risk-adjusted returns (Œ≤control = ‚àí.34, p = .04; Œ≤debiased = ‚àí.34, p = .04) compared to the benchmark and that the risk-adjusted returns were especially reduced short-term (Œ≤08/2023 = ‚àí2.3, p = .02; Œ≤09/2023 = ‚àí3.43, p < .001; Œ≤10/2023 = ‚àí3.29, p < .01). In summary, this study provides evidence that a narrow debiasing approach‚Äîtargeting a single investment risk dimension‚Äîfails to reduce exposure to that specific risk in LLM-generated financial advice. Our findings suggest that private investors may only partially mitigate their investment risk exposure through simple prompt-based debiasing interventions. This is important as more advanced debiasing techniques, such as fine-tuning models, are not accessible to most private investors. In Study 2b we assessed to which extent a broader debiasing prompt may reduce the overall financial portfolio risk. Specifying multiple risks in the debiasing prompt, this prompting strategy may reinforce the risk reduction of every single risk alone as such broad debiasing interventions can often lead to effective debiasing of LLMs [74]. We tested this possibility by employing the same experimental design as in Study 2a, with an overarching debiasing prompt intervention (‚ÄúAvoid common investment mistakes such as lack of diversification, cluster risks, and active management‚Äù). A MANOVA with the investment risks as the dependent and the prompting condition (control vs. debiasing intervention), risk-taking tendency, and age as the predictors showed a significant effect for the prompting condition (ŒõWilks = .62, F(5, 165) = 20.58, p < .001), risk-taking tendency (ŒõWilks = .31, F(10, 330) = 25.84, p < .001), while the effect of age was non-significant (ŒõWilks = .93, F(5, 165) = 2.14, p = .06). Follow-up contrasts revealed that this broader debiasing intervention (vs. the narrow debiasing intervention in Study 2a) was largely successful at reducing a range of investment risks (Fig 8). Specifically, we find that the debiasing prompt reduced the over-investment in US assets and sector concentration (while still remaining significantly greater compared to the benchmark however). The amount of assets allocated to US assets was reduced by over 10% but remained at a still high 80% level. Additional contrasts further show that the sector concentration decreased due to a significant 8% and 9% investment allocation decrease in the predominant technology and consumer cyclical sectors. These findings highlight that a more equal distribution across sectors is easier to achieve compared to an equal distribution across financial markets (i.e., arguably due to the strong presence of US-based equities). We find that the debiasing intervention also significantly reduced trend chasing to the extent that it no longer differs significantly from the benchmark. Simultaneously, we find that the debiasing intervention reduces the share of actively managed investment options by over 32%. Finally, the debiasing intervention also significantly decreased the TER by more than.06%. Nevertheless, TER remained notably higher compared to our benchmark. We find (A) above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 180), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 180), (D) active investment risk (N = 180), and (C) non-different trend chasing risk (N = 180) when using a broad debiasing intervention. The violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the respective characteristic by condition. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolios. The dashed line represents the value of the benchmark. We find (A) above benchmark geographical cluster risk (N = 180), (B) sector cluster risk (N = 180), (D) active investment risk (N = 180), and (C) non-different trend chasing risk (N = 180) when using a broad debiasing intervention.

We find that the debiasing intervention significantly decreased the sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, and active investment allocation risk especially for investors with medium and high risk-taking tendency. Additionally, the debiasing intervention also decreased the total expense risk for high risk-taking tendency and the sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, and active investment allocation risk across all age levels. The collective insight is that broader debiasing interventions explicitly targeting multiple investment risks simultaneously can significantly reduce portfolio risks across most dimensions and age groups, although the geographic concentration remains somewhat elevated above benchmark levels. The differential effectiveness across investor profiles‚Äîwith greater risk reduction for medium and high risk-taking investors‚Äîsuggests that LLMs may be more susceptible to debiasing interventions when generating advice for more risk-tolerant investors, while continuing to embed the same biases reported earlier in recommendations for more conservative investors even after explicit correction attempts. Financial Performance Analysis. Analogous to Study 2a, we performed multiple mixed-linear regression models. Again, we find no significant difference of the LLM investment recommendations provided in the control (Œ≤ = ‚àí.25, p = .11) and the debiased condition (Œ≤ = ‚àí.29, p = .06) relative to the benchmark in terms of risk-adjusted returns. We only find a moderate temporal trend indicating lower risk-adjusted performance especially with reduced short-term returns (Œ≤08/2023 = ‚àí2.26, p = .02; Œ≤09/2023 = ‚àí3.46, p < .001; Œ≤10/2023 = ‚àí3.43, p < .001). We find that the risk-adjusted returns are worse for high (Œ≤ = ‚àí.40, p < .01) and low risk-taking tendency (Œ≤ = ‚àí.48 p < .001) in the control condition and for low risk-taking in the debiased condition (Œ≤ = ‚àí.37 p = .01). Further, we find again that the risk-adjusted returns are lower than the benchmark for 50-year-olds in the control condition (Œ≤control = ‚àí.34, p = .03) and for 30-year-olds in the debiased condition (Œ≤debiased = ‚àí.37, p = .02). Also, in this model we find that the risk-adjusted returns were especially reduced short-term at the beginning of the performance measurement period (Œ≤08/2023 = ‚àí2.26, p = .01; Œ≤09/2023 = ‚àí3.46, p < .001; Œ≤10/2023 = ‚àí3.43, p < .001). Thus, despite the successful risk reduction through broader debiasing interventions, both control and debiased LLM-generated portfolios still failed to outperform the benchmark on risk-adjusted returns. These results suggest that even when successful at mitigating specific portfolio risks, debiasing interventions do not translate into improved risk-adjusted performance, indicating that LLM-generated financial advice continues to carry inefficiencies that cannot be fully addressed through prompt engineering alone. In Study 3 we tested whether incorporating an explicit investment goal in the prompt further aids in mitigating specific investment risks in LLMs investment advice. The study directly tests the ability of LLMs to adapt their investment advice based on contextual information and to personalize the investment advice to specific investor needs. Instead of directly asking the LLM to reduce the investment risks of a portfolio, a private investor may prompt a specific investment goal that would in turn translate into a decrease of specific investment risks merely based on the contextual information provided. The current study tests this possibility to infer and ‚Äúsense‚Äù such context information. We employed the same experimental design as in Study 2a but incorporated an explicit investment goal in the prompt (‚ÄúI want to invest in a way that promotes responsible and socially impactful contributions to our global society.‚Äù). We anticipated that this goal would lead LLMs to offer financial advice with reduced geographical and sector concentration risks. The phrase ‚Äúcontributions to our global society‚Äù was expected to decrease investments in U.S. assets, while ‚Äúpromotes responsible and socially impactful contributions‚Äù aimed to lessen the focus on technology and consumer cyclical sectors and thereby potentially reducing the previously documented trend chasing risk. We also expected that incorporating such a goal would result in investment recommendations with higher ESG scores [75]. A MANOVA with the investment risks as response and the prompt condition (control vs. goal prompt), risk-taking tendency and age as predictors showed a significant effect of the prompt condition (ŒõWilks = .30, F(5, 161) = 74.31, p < .001), risk-taking tendency (ŒõWilks = .51, F(10, 322) = 12.67, p < .001), while showing only a marginal effect of age (ŒõWilks = .94, F(5, 161) = 2.20, p = .06). Follow-up contrasts revealed that investment risks showed a significant decrease in over-investments in US Stocks in the investment goal prompt compared to control, yet higher than our benchmark. However, we find that the introduction of a socially responsible investment goal did not lead to a significant decrease in sector concentration compared to the control prompt and remains still significantly higher than the benchmark index. As shown in Fig 9:A, not only remains this sector concentration very high, but is also substantially overleveraged towards utilities, due to shifting investments towards the energy sector (i.e., ‚Äúgreen‚Äù energy). Next, we further examined the ESG score in the intervention (vs. control) condition. As summarized in Fig 9: B, specific investment goals were not effective in increasing the portfolio ESG rating of the portfolio. Specifically, we find that there is no significant portfolio ESG rating difference when incorporating a social responsibility goal prompt compared to the control prompt or benchmark. However, it is worth noting that incorporating the social responsibility goal effectively reduced the risk of receiving a low ESG rating compared to control (Levene‚Äôs test: F(1, 693) = 23.83, p < .001). We also observe a significant decrease in trend chasing behavior in the LLM investment advice when incorporating a social responsibility investment goal. Adding the social responsibility investment goal however, increased the actively managed portfolio share by over 29% compared to the control condition. Thus, LLMs engage in significantly more ‚Äústock picking‚Äù when provided with a specific investment goal. Finally, we observe significantly higher total expense ratios when incorporating a social responsibility goal compared to our control condition and benchmark. (A) illustrates the portfolio weight by condition and country relative to the benchmark for the top five sectors (N = 180). In (B) (N = 180) the violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the ESG score by condition. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolios. The dashed line represents the ESG score value of the benchmark. (A) illustrates the portfolio weight by condition and country relative to the benchmark for the top five sectors (N = 180). In (B) (N = 180) the violin plots and boxplots represent the shape of the distribution of the ESG score by condition. The black dot represents the mean and the colored dots the value of individual portfolios. The dashed line represents the ESG score value of the benchmark. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.g009 One-way ANOVAs and planned follow-up contrasts with Tukey HSD correction revealed that incorporating the social responsibility goal in the prompt led to a significant increase in active investment allocation and total expense risk for participants with low and medium risk-taking tendencies. In contrast, trend chasing risk decreased for those with medium and high risk-taking tendencies under the same condition. Further, the ESG score only increased for high risk-taking tendency when including the socially responsible investment goal where the ESG score was significantly lower (vs. medium and high self-stated risk-taking tendency) in the control condition. The geographical cluster risk decreased only for 50-year-olds. All other contrasts did not yield any meaningful patterns. The collective insight is that while LLMs can effectively adapt their investment advice to specific goals like a stronger social responsibility focus‚Äîevidenced by reduced US-centric investments and less trend chasing behavior‚Äîthese adaptations come with significant trade-offs, including increased active management, higher expense ratios, and sector concentration shifted toward utilities rather than truly diversified portfolios. The inconsistent effectiveness across investor profiles further suggests that LLMs struggle to simultaneously optimize for both specific investment goals and fundamental portfolio construction principles, creating potentially new risk patterns when attempting to accommodate more personalized investing objectives. Financial Performance Analysis. As in the preceding studies, we conducted a series of mixed-linear models to analyze portfolio performance. We find that investments recommended by LLMs in the control condition are not significantly different from the benchmark in terms of risk-adjusted returns (Œ≤ = ‚àí.25, p = .15). In the debiased condition, the LLM investment advice even underperformed the benchmark significantly (Œ≤ = ‚àí.76, p < .001). The temporal trend indicating worse risk-adjusted performance in the beginning holds also for this model (Œ≤08/2023 = ‚àí2.62, p = .01; Œ≤09/2023 = ‚àí3.76, p < .001; Œ≤10/2023 = ‚àí3.78, p < .001; Œ≤10/2023 = ‚àí2.20, p = .04). We find that this underperformance in the debiased condition stems from the underperformance across both high (Œ≤ = ‚àí1, p < .001) and medium risk-taking tendency investors (Œ≤ = ‚àí1.02, p < .001) and we also find a clear underperformance for low risk-taking tendency in the control condition (Œ≤ = ‚àí.48, p < .01). While we find no significant risk-adjusted underperformance for any age in the control condition, we document a strong underperformance across all age groups in the debiased condition (Œ≤15 = ‚àí.70, p < .001; Œ≤30 = ‚àí.75, p < .001; Œ≤50 = ‚àí.85, p < .001). Thus, we find overall that the introduction of socially responsible investment goals in LLM-generated advice led to significant underperformance compared to the benchmark, highlighting that when LLMs attempt to optimize for specific social impact objectives, they tend to sacrifice financial performance even more severely and lead to new, unwanted concentration issues (i.e., higher concentration in the utilities sector to promote investments in ‚Äúgreen‚Äù energy). LLMs often reveal biases implicitly present in the underlying training data [33‚Äì35,38,76]. Our findings suggest that these biases can result in LLM-generated financial advice that leads to elevated investment risks for private investors across five major risk dimensions (geographical cluster risk, sector cluster risk, trend chasing risk, active investment allocation risk, and total expense risk) and that a range of debiasing interventions only partially mitigated these risks. We find that LLMs recommend a narrow range of geographical regions to invest, concentrate on a few narrow sectors, engage in more aggressive trend-following and stock-picking, and ultimately propose high-fee investment options‚Äîall recommendations that are incompatible with modern portfolio theory [46,52,56‚Äì58,77‚Äì81]. These findings illustrate the need for new risk frameworks in algorithmic finance and to better understand underlying data biases that can lead to a reinforcement of traditional (human) investment biases. The findings of this research document the inherent risks for private investors who already started to employ LLMs to receive financial advice [15], and we hope that the current findings promote a more critical assessment of the advice they receive. However, it is noteworthy to highlight that a critical assessment becomes more difficult when LLM-generated investment advice is communicated very convincingly (see S3 Appendix for details). These findings are sensitive because they suggest a potentially misleading sense of confidence and benevolence by LLM-generated investment advice, paired with precautionary ‚Äúdisclaimers‚Äù added in over 95% of the cases across all LLMs we examined. This finding is important in light of prior work showing that LLM advice is often perceived as strikingly more positive even though the advice might carry inherent bias or when the advice is objectively worse compared to expert humans [27,82‚Äì86]. The ability to blindly follow harmful LLM-generated investment recommendations presents a significant risk for individual investors, particularly those lacking potentially financial literacy or access to professional financial advisors. Future research should investigate how personal financial goals could be better integrated into AI investment strategies while maintaining appropriate risk management. A fruitful direction for future work is also to further examine whether financial education (potentially even through the use of LLMs) can ultimately empower private investors to critically assess such LLM-generated investment recommendations. Future regulatory research may also focus on developing frameworks to protect consumers from the potential risks of such generative investment advice. This includes exploring effective monitoring mechanisms to prevent more large-scale, systemic risks across financial markets and establishing reporting requirements for firms that utilize generative investment advisory tools. As LLMs become more integrated into financial advisory services, regulators may need to establish clear guidelines for transparency, explainability, and accountability in such AI-driven financial advice, especially when used by private investors. For FinTech developers, our research highlights the importance of addressing inherent biases in LLM-generated financial advice and how to develop future systems that better align with modern portfolio theory principles and avoid reinforcing harmful investment biases documented in the current research. A main question for future work will be how generative investment advice algorithms can be trained to generate recommendations that are more consistent with investors‚Äô long-term financial goals and risk tolerance without inducing the investment risks reported in this paper. As with any research, we also highlight at least two limitations of the current work. First, we evaluated LLMs at specific points in time, and these models continue to evolve very rapidly. While our robustness checks with the most recent models (as per January 2025) seem to be robust (see Robustness Checks at the end of Study 1), future generations of models might improve radically once foundation models might be explicitly debiased during the training stage. Second, our simulated investment portfolios were evaluated over a specific time-period that coincided with a strong technology sector performance. However, we believe that exactly due to these favorable market conditions for technology-heavy portfolios, our financial performance analysis reported in this paper represent a conservative estimate of the potential risks of LLM-based financial advice. In market environments where technology sectors underperform, the geographical and sector concentration risks we identified would likely lead to even worse investment outcomes, further amplifying the risk exposure of portfolios generated by LLMs. In conclusion, the current work demonstrates that LLM-generated investment advice systematically increases portfolio risks across multiple dimensions, potentially exposing private investors to unwanted investment risks while creating a false sense of confidence through convincing language and reassuring disclaimers. These findings underscore the need for more cross-disciplinary collaboration among investors (both private and institutional investors), regulators, FinTech innovators, financial institutions, and researchers to develop more robust frameworks for evaluating and improving AI-generated financial advice. We hope the current research promotes such collaborations to proactively transform the financial advisory landscape to truly serve the interests of private investors through properly diversified, low-cost, and personalized financial advice. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.s001 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.s002 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.s003 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0325459.s004 (DOCX) We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful feedback and constructive suggestions that significantly improved this manuscript.

Diane Brady is executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative and Fortune Live Media. She also writes the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. Earlier this week, I had a chance to chat with Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi and play with the four AI-powered agents that are rolling out next week for Quickbooks Online. It‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve seen agents deployed so effectively in handing off tasks to each other while helping humans be more productive. (I did enjoy seeing Cognizant‚Äôs Babak Hodjat create multi-agent systems on the spot at the Fortune COO Summit earlier this month, but many of us will deploy agents, not create them.) Intuit has four themed agents‚Äîa customer one for spotting leads in emails, drafting emails, and tracking interactions to the point of sales; one for payments to streamline and speed up that process; another for finance, to analyze and help you boost the health of your business; and a fourth for accounting, to reconcile expenses and make your bookkeepers happy.

June 26, 2025 17:45 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, June 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a forward share split for the GraniteShares 2x Long PLTR (the ‚ÄúFund‚Äù). The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of these splits. After the close of the markets on July 08, 2025 (the ‚ÄúPayable Date‚Äù), the Fund will effect a forward split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: As a result of the share split, shareholders of the Fund will receive fifteen shares for each share held as indicated in the table above. Accordingly, the number of the Fund‚Äôs issued and outstanding shares will increase by the approximate percentage indicated above. The ticker and CUSIP will not be affected by the transaction. The share split will apply to shareholders of record as of the close of the NASDAQ Stock Market (the ‚ÄúNASDAQ‚Äù) on July 08, 2025 (the ‚ÄúRecord Date‚Äù), payable after the close of the NASDAQ on the Payable Date. Shares of the Funds will begin trading on the NASDAQ on a split-adjusted basis on July 09, 2025 (the ‚ÄúEx-Date‚Äù). On the Ex-Date, the opening market value of the Fund‚Äôs issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder‚Äôs investment value, will not be affected by the share split. However, the per share net asset value (‚ÄúNAV‚Äù) and opening market price on the Ex-Date will be approximately one-fifteenth. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical fifteen-for-one split on a shareholder‚Äôs investment. 15-for-1 forward split About GraniteShares GraniteShares is an independent ETF issuer headquartered in New York City. GraniteShares offers the following leveraged single stock ETFs: In addition, GraniteShares‚Äô ETF suite includes the following ETFs: (1) GraniteShares Advisors LLC has contractually agreed to waive its fees and/or pay for operating expenses of the Fund to ensure that total annual fund operating expenses (exclusive of any (i) interest, (ii) brokerage fees and commission, (iii) acquired fund fees and expenses, (iv) fees and expenses associated with instruments in other collective investment vehicles or derivative instruments (including for example options and swap fees and expenses), (v) interest and dividend expense on short sales, (vi) taxes, (vii) other fees related to underlying investments (such as option fees and expenses or swap fees and expenses), (viii) expenses incurred in connection with any merger or reorganization or (ix) extraordinary expenses such as litigation) will not exceed 1.15%.

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock‚Äôs performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock‚Äôs performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with ‚ÄúLong‚Äù in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with ‚ÄúShort‚Äù in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day‚Äôs return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day‚Äôs returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock‚Äôs performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock‚Äôs performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day‚Äôs return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day‚Äôs returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock‚Äôs performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock‚Äôs performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses. This information is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any Funds to any person in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Please consult your tax advisor about the tax consequences of an investment in Fund shares, including the possible application of foreign, state, and local tax laws. You could lose money by investing in the ETFs. There can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Funds will be achieved.

The funds seek daily leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. The funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives, which means that the funds are riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage because the fund magnifies the performance of the underlying security.

An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The Funds track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification that most mutual funds and exchange-traded funds offer.

Title: CoreWeave revives bid for Core Scientific causing shares to surge 33%

CORZ shares jumped nearly 34% on intraday fueled by the acquisition rumors. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. CoreWeave is negotiating to acquire Bitcoin (BTC) miner-turned-compute host Core Scientific, the Wall Street Journal reported on June 26, citing people familiar with the matter. The cloud infrastructure company attempted to acquire the miner for $5.75 per share in June 2024 but withdrew after Core Scientific‚Äôs board deemed the price inadequate. Core Scientific and CoreWeave have not issued public statements on the negotiations. Core Scientific‚Äôs CORZ stock was trading at $16.44 as of press time, up 33.7% on the session and more than 3x from last year‚Äôs proposal. The rally followed a year-to-date slide of about 15% that left the miner trading well below the all-time high it set after emerging from bankruptcy protection in January. CoreWeave, which went public in March with a $75 billion capitalization, lists Microsoft as its largest customer, accounting for 62% of 2024 revenue, and rents Nvidia GPUs to corporate clients that include Meta Platforms and IBM. Executives at Core Scientific dismissed last year‚Äôs $1 billion overture as ‚Äúunsolicited‚Äù and below intrinsic value, then signed 12-year hosting agreements that commit the miner to deliver 200 megawatts (MW) of power for CoreWeave‚Äôs high-performance-computing clusters. Board members stated at the time that the arrangement would generate approximately $3.5 billion in cumulative revenue and help diversify income away from block subsidies after the April 2024 Bitcoin halving. Core Scientific already hosts 16 MW of CoreWeave GPUs at its Austin campus, and plans staged expansions across several sites in Texas and Oklahoma. The parties allegedly aim to finalize terms within weeks if talks stay on track, the sources said. Yet, neither side disclosed price parameters. Core Scientific‚Äôs rapid pivot toward AI infrastructure, combined with a power-constrained data-center market, could justify a premium well above the miner‚Äôs undisturbed value, bankers following the situation noted. CoreWeave CEO Mike Intrator seeks to expand capacity to meet the cloud-AI demand that exceeds current inventory across hyperscale providers. Core Scientific controls about 724 megawatts of contracted power across its US footprint and ranks among North America‚Äôs top owners of immersion-cooled mining rigs. The miner‚Äôs ability to repurpose part of that load for GPU computing aligns with CoreWeave‚Äôs push to secure low-cost electricity and ready-built shells, avoiding multiyear greenfield construction. If negotiations succeed, CoreWeave will absorb a fleet of Bitmain S21-class miners and a pipeline of brownfield sites that can flip to GPU racks. Core Scientific shareholders would receive cash or stock at a yet-to-be-determined ratio.

Title: Black Friday Email Marketing Strategy: 10 Tips and Examples (2025) - Shopify Ireland

Time Published: 2025-06-26T18:05:16Z
Full Content:
Black Friday is one of the biggest sales events of the year. Last year, Shopify merchants drove a record-breaking $11.5 billion in sales during the Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) weekend. With so many consumers open to shopping during the holiday weekend, leaning on tried and tested marketing channels can open the floodgates to more revenue in the fourth quarter. For many retailers, that‚Äôs email marketing. Email is the third-most influential channel on holiday purchase decisions, beating influencer endorsements, in-person experiences, and conversations with retail associates in-store. But when so many retailers rely on this direct line of communication to promote holiday sales, it‚Äôs difficult to stand out in a subscriber‚Äôs crowded inbox. This guide shares innovative Black Friday email marketing strategies to try this year, with best practices and examples from leading retailers. Customer data is the most valuable asset any ecommerce business has. It allows you to tailor email outreach and deliver on customers‚Äô expectations for a personalized shopping experience. Yet 85% of internet users want to do more to protect their online privacy, meaning this strategy can be difficult to implement. Before the holiday season arrives, take stock of the customer data you currently have. If your email list is small or you don‚Äôt have supplementary information to personalize campaigns to existing subscribers, deploy lead generation campaigns to gather more holiday season customer data. For example: Because Shopify offers a customer data platform (CDP) by default, any first-party data you‚Äôve collected on your customers gets combined in a unified customer profile. Whenever they share their email address or phone number, this data‚Äîsuch as their order history, loyalty points they‚Äôve earned, previous emails they‚Äôve opened, and/or customer service tickets they‚Äôve raised‚Äîall funnel back to one place, giving you one source of truth for every shopper. Black Friday might only last one day, but consumers are still open to making holiday purchases in the run up to the big event. Klaviyo found that more than half of consumers think a month earlier than November is the ideal time for brands to initiate their holiday shopping season sales. Most retailers start seeding their Black Friday email promotions 21 days before the big event‚Äîa strategy dubbed ‚ÄúBlack November,‚Äù which includes other holiday shopping dates: The majority of consumers look for discounts and sales during this period‚Äîso much so, 7 in 10 consider price the top factor in their holiday purchase decisions, beating quality (61%), variety (34%), and warranties or returns policies (31%). Take advantage of consumers‚Äô openness to pre-Black Friday promotions by creating a holiday calendar. Perhaps you give your email list early access to your sale, or build hype around a new product drop by teasing it to subscribers, with an automated series like this: Not all holiday shoppers are the same. Some might be looking for gifts for a loved one‚Äîothers might want to take advantage of a hefty discount to buy a product that‚Äôs been on their wishlist for months. Segmentation allows you to identify these buyer preferences and deliver personalized Black Friday email marketing campaigns. Key Black Friday customer segments to email include: Customers who‚Äôve visited your New Orleans store within the last six months, for instance, could receive an email that invites them to your retail store‚Äôs exclusive holiday sale which starts two days before Black Friday. Yet instead of relying solely on historical data to forecast each segment‚Äôs next steps, lean on predictive analytics. These tools digest large datasets using machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately predict what a customer will do next. üí°Tip: Shopify‚Äôs segmentation features pull data from unified customer profiles to group customers based on qualities they share. Choose from prebuilt segment templates, or build your own with the ShopifyQL query editor. All segments are dynamic‚Äîsubscribers will move in and out of segments automatically when data from their unified profile changes. Segmentation isn‚Äôt the only way to personalize emails around the Black Friday weekend. Dynamic content blocks adjust smaller sections of your email, instead of sending the same email to everyone who fits your segmentation criteria. Let‚Äôs say, for example, that you‚Äôve defined a segment of VIP customers to target during Black Friday. Subscribers have one thing in common‚Äîthey have a customer lifetime value of over $500‚Äîbut they don‚Äôt all share the same buying behaviors. Some have saved the loyalty rewards they‚Äôve earned‚Äîothers have made a portion of their purchases in-store. Further personalize the Black Friday emails that each subscriber in this segment receives with dynamic content blocks. That could be: Black Friday sales are effective because they‚Äôre exclusive‚Äîeither in terms of product quantity (for example, a limited amount of inventory) or because the promotion ends at a specific time. Lean into this time sensitivity and encourage Black Friday subscribers to take advantage now rather than later. This scarcity can induce the fear of missing out, a psychological phenomenon that influences people to buy even when they didn‚Äôt intend on doing so. Effective marketing techniques to create urgency in your Black Friday emails include: reMarkable, for example, has a countdown timer in their email to announce Black Friday is ending. It offers visual representation of when the deal ends, instead of just a generic ‚ÄúSale ends tonight!‚Äù message. Email inboxes are a crowded place to be at the best of times‚Äînever mind on Black Friday, when every retailer wants to capitalize on consumers‚Äô willingness to buy. Email marketing platform Omnisend processed 1.13 billion emails in the week surrounding BFCM. Klaviyo reported similar figures: at its peak, merchants sent 420 million messages in a single hour on Black Friday. An email subject line is the first thing that subscribers see when your campaign lands in their inbox. A best practice is to split-test strategies such as: Here are some real examples that incorporate these best practices and stood out to me during the Black Friday weekend last year: Promotions and flash drops can incentivize holiday shoppers to make impulsive purchases. Remove the biggest barrier to them doing so‚Äîfinding the money to pay for their order‚Äîby offering buy now, pay later (BNPL). During the BFCM weekend last year, consumers spent over $686.3 million on BNPL purchases, up 8.8% from the year before. Of those who have used this type of service, almost a third say they‚Äôd be more likely to spend money on discretionary goods if the retailer offered BNPL as an option. Shop Pay Installments offers an easy way to add BNPL options at checkout. Customers can choose to divide their purchases into smaller, more manageable installments. Combined with Shop Pay, the best-converting checkout on the internet, it‚Äôs no surprise that Shop Pay Installments has been proven to reduce cart abandonment by 28% and increase average order value by as much as 50%. Email might be the only direct line of communication you have with Black Friday customers, but it‚Äôs not the only way to command their attention. SMS marketing is the easiest integration since most email marketing platforms, including Klaviyo, offer SMS integration as standard. For example, you could send an email campaign to a particular segment, then use SMS to follow up with those who haven‚Äôt yet redeemed the offer or opened the email. It‚Äôs an approach proven to get results: Klaviyo reports that merchants who integrated SMS into their Black Friday email marketing strategy experienced a 20% YoY increase in ecommerce revenue during BFCM, accounting for more than $100 million in gross merchandise value. Email can also complement paid advertising strategies as costs skyrocket throughout Black Friday season. Shopify Audiences builds custom retargeting lists to export to platforms like Meta, Google Ads, and TikTok. It‚Äôs helped merchants like Happy Hippo achieve a 4.7x return on ad spend (ROAS) while cutting customer acquisition costs (CAC) by 72%. ‚ÄúShopify Audiences is a huge benefit for Plus merchants,‚Äù says CEO and lead product designer Adam Biel. ‚ÄúIt has helped lower customer acquisition costs so our investments can stretch much further with Facebook ads.‚Äù Transactional emails tend to be overlooked when marketers attempt to compete with other retailers for attention during Black Friday. Yet they‚Äôre an opportunity to strengthen relationships with the customers you‚Äôve already acquired. Comb through the automated emails you send as standard when customers complete a certain action. Here are some examples and ideas to optimize them: Black Friday, Cyber Monday regularly break records, but not all of them are good. Most customers acquired during BFCM have a lower lifetime value. This occurs partly because these customers were being opportunistic and taking advantage of your promotions, but also because your brand loses mindshare throughout the year. Design an email retention sequence to retain holiday shoppers after Black Friday ends. You could: üí°Tip: Shopify Flow takes the logistical hassle out of these holiday marketing automations. Work from prebuilt templates‚Äîsuch as inviting shoppers to your loyalty program when their unified customer profile meets specific criteria‚Äîor custom code your own. It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in the excitement of new promotions and segmentation strategies that turn email subscribers into paying customers‚Äîso much so, that retailers often forget the fundamentals. Here‚Äôs a quick reminder of the email optimization best practices to keep in mind while writing Black Friday emails: If you‚Äôre in the midst of a creative lull and are searching for ideas on how to make your Black Friday emails stand out, draw inspiration from these examples. Shoppers are especially prone to abandoning online carts in search of better Black Friday deals. This cart recovery email from Pulp & Press reminds each individual customer of the products they abandoned, with a reminder that it‚Äôs the biggest sale of the year‚Äîand that they should take advantage now, before the deal ends. Black Friday might be the biggest online sales event of the year, but it‚Äôs not always the most profitable. Discounts tend to lure in low-value customers who might only purchase from you when products are heavily discounted. Detox Market‚Äôs Black Friday email is a great example of how to combat this with tiered promotions. The more customers spend, the bigger the discount. Freaks of Nature leans into scarcity with their ‚Äúalmost gone‚Äù Black Friday email. The call to action button tells people to ‚Äúsecure‚Äù their shirt‚Äîmore strategic than just ‚Äúget yours today.‚Äù Plus, it uses price anchoring to showcase the before and after sale price of each bestseller. There are also direct checkout links for email subscribers to complete their purchases without searching the online store for the perfect item. It‚Äôs tempting to shout about your bestselling products or hefty discounts with innovative email designs. Home furnishings brand Revival takes a different approach. Instead, the brand shares a letter authored by their founder, which wishes them a wonderful holiday weekend with a gentle nudge to buy the item on their wishlist. The email also features a note beneath the sign-off that teases the following day‚Äôs email. This tactic can increase open rates during Black Friday‚Äîsubscribers are already on the lookout for the campaign. With so much competition to reach your target market during Black Friday, leaning into your brand values can attract conscious consumers who care more about sticking to their morals than impressive discounts. Deodorant brand Fussy, for example, is a certified B-Corp that sells deodorants made with natural ingredients and refillable cases designed to reduce plastic waste. Their target audience cares about sustainability, hence why the retailer‚Äôs Black Friday email marketing strategy was to rename the event ‚ÄúGreen Week.‚Äù Email marketing spans every stage of the customer journey, from aiding initial product discovery to encouraging customer retention. Shopify has everything you need to personalize this end-to-end experience, including unified customer profiles and segmentation to put your data to work. Plus, when holiday email campaigns drive record levels of website traffic, you don‚Äôt have to worry about outages or downtime. Shopify‚Äôs infrastructure handled over 57.3 PB of data, 1.19 trillion edge requests, and 10.5 trillion database queries during the last BFCM. It‚Äôs why leading brands like Represent, Knix, and Muscle Nation trust Shopify to capitalize on Black Friday sales. ‚ÄúBlack Friday can be nerve-wracking,‚Äù says Stefan Lewis, chief digital officer at Represent. ‚ÄúBut Shopify has always helped us in terms of increasing bandwidth and we‚Äôve never run into any issues around site speed.‚Äù Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) email is a marketing strategy where retailers reach their target customers through targeted emails. These holiday campaigns typically include promotions, sales, discounts, gift suggestions, and product recommendations. To write an effective Black Friday email, lead with a time-sensitive offer in the subject line and header. Use mobile-first design, highlight bestsellers or exclusives, and include urgency-driven CTAs like ‚Äúget yours before it‚Äôs too late.‚Äù The best time to send Black Friday emails is in the runup to the big event. Most consumers start holiday gift shopping before Black Friday arrives. A pre-launch campaign can ensure your brand is top of mind when they‚Äôre ready to buy. Use targeted emails to announce a Black Friday sale. Divide your audience into segments based on traits they share, and include contextual recommendations‚Äîfor example, discounts on products similar to those they‚Äôve bought.

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/26/2025 9:11:06 AM PDT by delta7 Former Wall Street money manager and financial analyst Ed Dowd of PhinanceTechnologies.com has been forecasting ‚ÄúDanger of Deep Worldwide Recession in 2025.‚Äù It looks like his thesis is turning out correct. He predicted interest rates would be declining. They did. And inflation has been going down right along with the economy as illegal immigration was being stopped and deportations ramped up. Dowd says, ‚ÄúOur friend Joe Biden spent anywhere between $500 billion to $2 trillion to bring these people in and set them up. Now, that‚Äôs all going the wrong way. Trump has shut down the border crossings, and as deportations heat up, that will only add to the problem. There will be a lot of supply, and prices have already started coming down in certain regions, and that is going to accelerate. Inflation is going to be coming down. Chairman Powell is dead-ass wrong. Tariffs are actually deflationary, and he‚Äôs holding rates higher for longer. That is going to end up being a big policy error. We think interest rates have peaked for the year. . .. We think the Fed will be forced to cut rates when the hard data comes in the wrong way.‚Äù What is Dowd looking at most? Dowd says, ‚ÄúIf we did have an oil shock, our thesis of a deep world-wide recession would trigger even faster. During the last twelve days of this Iran/Israel war, I said to my followers, I am watching one thing and one thing only, and that is the price of oil. The price of oil did go up . . . I said if oil breaks out above $80 per barrel, then we‚Äôve got problems. Oil has collapsed, and the oil markets are telling you the Iranians are not going to close the Strait of Hormuz. So, for now, the economies of the world are not going to be experiencing an oil price shock.‚Äù That does not mean we are set for clear sailing throughout 2025. Dowd is forecasting that commercial and residential real estate will be a huge drag on the economy as prices fall and fall hard. Dowd says, ‚ÄúWe think shelter is going to trend lower, and there is going to be a deflationary scare coming.‚Äù Dowd thinks the Fed will panic and have emergency rate cuts this fall. The stock market will take some big hits. Dowd says, ‚ÄúI think they freak out in the fall in October or November. . .. I will point out airlines have taken out previous lows, homebuilders are weak, the DOW Jones transports are not close to all-time highs. The real economy is rolling over. Typically, when bubbles like this end, everyone is on the wrong side of the trade, and it‚Äôs going to happen quick. . .. Warren Buffett is telling you everything you need to know about this market.‚Äù Buffett has reportedly $350 billion in cash on the sidelines. Dowd favors gold because the big banks like gold. Dowd says, ‚ÄúGold counts as a quasi-asset because it is a Tier 1 asset. That means they can create loans against that as an asset whereas before you couldn‚Äôt. It was not Tier 1. This is going to be misunderstood by a lot of people, and gold is now a big deal again. . .. If I am a long-term investor, I am going to do what the banks are doing. They have made gold money again. So, gold is money good . . . I am going to go with what the banks are buying.‚Äù Dowd wrote a popular book called ‚ÄúCause Unknown,‚Äù which tracked the deaths and injuries that started after the CV19 vax rollout in 2021. He‚Äôs still tracking the injuries that just added another 700,000 disabled people. Since the CV19 injections started, that‚Äôs a hit a new high of 5.5 million permanently disabled Americans. Dowd says, ‚ÄúThis looks like a bullish trend that isn‚Äôt stopping anytime soon. It goes up to a new high, consolidates and breaks out again. If this was a growth stock, I‚Äôd be all over it, and I‚Äôd be long disability. . .. the meta data, the big data, says something drastically changed in 2021. It‚Äôs a disaster. I think it‚Äôs the CV19 vaccine. I find it interesting there is no curiosity about this even with the new administration. It‚Äôs an elephant in the room, and they don‚Äôt want to talk about it.‚Äù There is much more in the 46-minute interview.

Dowd says, ‚ÄúIf we did have an oil shock, our thesis of a deep world-wide recession would trigger even faster. During the last twelve days of this Iran/Israel war, I said to my followers, I am watching one thing and one thing only, and that is the price of oil. The price of oil did go up . . . I said if oil breaks out above $80 per barrel, then we‚Äôve got problems. Oil has collapsed, and the oil markets are telling you the Iranians are not going to close the Strait of Hormuz. So, for now, the economies of the world are not going to be experiencing an oil price shock.‚Äù That does not mean we are set for clear sailing throughout 2025. Dowd is forecasting that commercial and residential real estate will be a huge drag on the economy as prices fall and fall hard. Dowd says, ‚ÄúWe think shelter is going to trend lower, and there is going to be a deflationary scare coming.‚Äù Dowd thinks the Fed will panic and have emergency rate cuts this fall. The stock market will take some big hits. Dowd says, ‚ÄúI think they freak out in the fall in October or November. . .. I will point out airlines have taken out previous lows, homebuilders are weak, the DOW Jones transports are not close to all-time highs. The real economy is rolling over. Typically, when bubbles like this end, everyone is on the wrong side of the trade, and it‚Äôs going to happen quick. . .. Warren Buffett is telling you everything you need to know about this market.‚Äù Buffett has reportedly $350 billion in cash on the sidelines. Dowd favors gold because the big banks like gold. Dowd says, ‚ÄúGold counts as a quasi-asset because it is a Tier 1 asset. That means they can create loans against that as an asset whereas before you couldn‚Äôt. It was not Tier 1. This is going to be misunderstood by a lot of people, and gold is now a big deal again. . .. If I am a long-term investor, I am going to do what the banks are doing. They have made gold money again. So, gold is money good . . .

He‚Äôs still tracking the injuries that just added another 700,000 disabled people. Since the CV19 injections started, that‚Äôs a hit a new high of 5.5 million permanently disabled Americans. Dowd says, ‚ÄúThis looks like a bullish trend that isn‚Äôt stopping anytime soon. It goes up to a new high, consolidates and breaks out again. If this was a growth stock, I‚Äôd be all over it, and I‚Äôd be long disability. . .. the meta data, the big data, says something drastically changed in 2021. It‚Äôs a disaster.

Kay and Marco Migueis Ex-ante cost-benefit analyses and other impact assessments are now a standard part of the rulemaking process. Yet some important effects of regulation are difficult√¢¬Ä¬îor impossible√¢¬Ä¬îto assess before a rule takes effect. In such cases, ex-post (or retrospective) evaluation, conducted after a rule is in effect, offers an opportunity to measure real-world outcomes that could not reliably be predicted in advance. Such an evaluation can help determine whether a rule achieves its intended goals, whether the imposed costs are justified, and whether any unintended consequences have emerged. However, when rules are not designed with ex-post evaluation in mind, measuring certain impacts may be difficult or impossible in practice. This article discusses options to revise the rulemaking process to avoid this problem. Designing rules with ex-post evaluation in mind would facilitate such evaluations, ultimately leading to better rules. One rationale for evaluating rules is that they can impose costs on the public. To promote efficiency and minimize unintended harm, policymakers may prefer rules that are simple where complexity is unnecessary, inexpensive where high costs can be avoided, and designed to avoid adverse side effects. Recognizing these tradeoffs, the U.S. Congress has required federal agencies to conduct impact analyses for certain rulemakings.2 In addition, a standing executive order mandates that agencies perform cost-and-benefit analyses before issuing major new rules.3, 4 The ex-ante assessments help ensure that regulatory costs are justified and prevent some of the least cost-effective rules from being implemented. However, rules can prove more costly, yield fewer benefits, and produce more undesirable consequences than analysts anticipate in ex-ante assessments. These estimates are inherently uncertain, as they depend on future economic conditions and the reactions of regulated entities. Moreover, behavioral and political factors√¢¬Ä¬îsuch as bureaucratic optimism (Krause and Corder, 2007; Liu, Stoutenborough, and Vedlitz, 2016), ideologically motivated policymaking (Hogwood and Gunn, 1984; Prendergast, 2007), and regulatory capture by special interests (Dal Bo, 2006)√¢¬Ä¬îcan cause analysts to overestimate the net benefits of new rules. Current U.S. executive branch policy requires agencies to conduct retrospective analyses to support the periodic review of regulations.5 Similarly, an executive order issued by President Obama encourages independent agencies to conduct retrospective analysis√¢¬Ä¬îa recommendation that remains in effect.6 In addition, Section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act mandates that federal agencies periodically review regulations that have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Banking regulators are also required to regularly perform a systematic review of their regulations under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA). While these motivations for ex-post evaluation are evergreen, interest in such evaluations has grown in response to legal and political shifts over the past decade. During the first Trump administration, Executive Order 13771 (2017) required that "√¢¬Ä¬¶any new incremental costs associated with new regulations shall, to the extent permitted by law, be offset by the elimination of existing costs associated with at least two prior regulations." Although the executive order was rescinded during the Biden administration, that rescission was itself reversed in the second Trump administration.7 Executive Order 14192 now requires that the "√¢¬Ä¬¶total incremental cost of all new regulations, including repealed regulations, being finalized this year, shall be significantly less than zero."8 For policymakers aiming to meet such cost-reduction mandates, ex-post evaluation may help quantify regulatory cost changes and track progress toward aggregate cost targets. Further contributing to a changing policy environment, oversight bodies are increasingly pressing federal agencies to provide stronger analytic justification for their rules. For example, guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) instructs agencies to quantify the total incremental costs or savings of each new and repealed significant regulatory action or guidance document.9 The instructions in this guidance amount to establishing a regulatory cost budget for each agency. If agencies are expected to meet cost targets for new rules, they may be incentivized to identify regulations with high costs and low benefits to repeal or replace. Because retrospective evaluations often yield more accurate estimates of realized costs than ex-ante projections, they can be useful in quantifying current burdens and informing regulatory cost budgeting. Separate from this recent guidance on regulatory cost budgets, the OMB has historically encouraged agencies to plan for ex-post review of regulatory outcomes. In its 2017 annual report to Congress, OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) advised that "Rules should be written and designed to facilitate retrospective analysis of their effects, including consideration of the data that will be needed for future evaluation of the rules' ex-post costs and benefits."10√¢¬Ä¬ã The currently effective OMB Circular A-4 (2003) similarly supports using retrospective analysis to assess whether a regulation's costs have changed after implementation. The now-rescinded 2023 version of Circular A-4 went further, stating that "√¢¬Ä¬¶agencies may consider the benefits and costs of regulatory alternatives that would facilitate data collection to support future analyses or retrospective review. These alternatives may be especially valuable if there are significant uncertainties about benefits or costs, or if benefits or costs may change over time." In practice, agencies are expected to estimate a rule's costs and benefits before issuance and, in some cases, to design regulations in ways that facilitate later evaluation of their realized impacts. When agencies seek to support their rules with empirical evidence in legal proceedings, ex-post analyses can help demonstrate whether predicted benefits and costs materialized. The need to defend regulations in court may be growing. Two Supreme Court decisions in 2024 significantly increased the legal risks for federal rulemaking. In Corner Post, the Court held that the six-year statute of limitations under the Administrative Procedure Act begins when a regulated party is first subject to the rule, rather than when the rule is finalized, which had been the prior interpretation. In Loper Bright, the Court overturned the Chevron doctrine, which had required courts to defer to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes. This decision shifted interpretive authority from agencies to the judiciary and may lead to greater scrutiny in litigation. While these are only two among many legal risks agencies face, ex-post evaluation may strengthen a rule's legal defensibility by providing evidence that its benefits outweigh its costs. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has consistently emphasized the importance of retrospective review in strengthening regulatory quality. In reports from 2007, 2014, and 2018, the GAO called for expanding or improving the use of ex-post evaluation across federal agencies.11 Despite such calls, challenges persist. For example, a 2024 GAO review of independent federal financial regulators found that they had conducted few retrospective reviews of their existing rules.12 Finally, some policymakers may view ex-post evaluation as a tool to promote public trust in the government. Demonstrating that regulatory decisions are reviewed and evidence-based can signal accountability and responsiveness. Research suggests that transparency, such as disclosing government performance, can positively influence citizens' perceptions of government.13 When conducted, ex-post evaluations can help identify rules that are underperforming or no longer justified. In some cases, this evidence may support repeal. In others, evidence of strong performance and low costs could justify expanding a rule's scope: for example, by extending it to additional firms, increasing its stringency, or replacing alternative policies based on demonstrated effectiveness. This article proposes strategies to improve the government's capacity to conduct meaningful ex-post evaluations, supporting such analysis in contexts where policymakers choose to pursue it.14 While ex-post evaluations are incredibly valuable for improving the regulatory environment, conducting them can be difficult. Key challenges include identifying an appropriate counterfactual, gathering data on outcomes, and attributing these outcomes to the rule itself. Fortunately, these challenges can be mitigated when regulations are designed and implemented with evaluation in mind. The sections that follow explore organizational and implementation choices that can support ex-post evaluation.15 Staffing rulemakings with an eye toward ex-post evaluation Ex-post evaluation benefits from the early involvement of evaluation staff in the rulemaking process. Such staff can help identify opportunities to design rules in ways that support future evaluation. The marginal costs of such an assignment are likely to be modest. Under current practices, evaluation staff are often already engaged in the rulemaking process√¢¬Ä¬îmaking suggestions to reduce burdens and increase benefits. Asking them to also identify opportunities to support ex-post evaluation is unlikely to add significant cost. However, embedding economic analysis staff in the rulemaking process poses tradeoffs. Their economic expertise can improve the quality of rules, but their participation may also reduce the independence of the evaluation process from policy development. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) mitigates this issue by assigning different cost-benefit analysts participate to the drafting and evaluation phases of a rule√¢¬Ä¬îan approach that requires more personnel and increases agency costs.16 But staff responsible for ex-ante impact analysis are often already engaged in the rulemaking process. Asking them to identify opportunities to support ex-post evaluation is unlikely to further reduce their independence. Therefore, the incremental cost of this added responsibility is likely modest, particularly when compared with the broader compliance costs and regulatory burdens of major regulations. To the extent that designing for ex-post evaluation leads to more such evaluations being conducted, costs may rise relative to the current baseline, where formal ex-post analyses are relatively uncommon. However, the cost of conducting these evaluations is typically modest compared to the potential benefits√¢¬Ä¬îsuch as improving the efficacy and efficiency of existing rules. Moreover, by designing rules to support evaluation, agencies may create natural experiments that external researchers can study at no additional cost to taxpayers. In some cases, this could reduce the incremental cost of evaluation to nearly zero. Policymakers should weigh these cost considerations alongside the potential political, procedural, and reputational benefits of ex-post evaluations. Differentiated implementation and application of rules Ex-post evaluation can be facilitated by differentiated application of rules across similar firms. Applying different rules to otherwise comparable entities creates natural treatment and control groups, improving the ability to identify regulatory effects.17 Two commonly used forms of differentiation that support such analyses are: (1) tiered application of rules based on firm size or other relevant criteria and (2) staggered implementation.18 In addition, while pure randomization of regulatory policies across firms is uncommon and poses several challenges, it has been used in public policy and will be discussed at the end of this section. Many regulations apply only to firms that exceed a certain threshold of activity, leaving firms below that threshold exempt.19 This tiered approach can be appropriate because imposing stricter requirements on to certain entities, such as those that are larger and more complex, often yields greater benefits than applying the same rules to other entities.20 Also, regulatory compliance costs tend to increase less than proportionally with activity levels (Brock and Evans, 1985).21 However, tiering can also create incentives for firms to remain below regulatory thresholds to avoid compliance costs, which may discourage growth and reduce economic efficiency.22 In addition to these potential costs and benefits, tiering enables regulators to compare outcomes between firms above and below the threshold, helping to identify the effects of regulation. Ex-post analyses that utilize regulatory thresholds have provided valuable insights into the effects of financial regulations. Examples include Acharya et al. (2018), who found that the introduction of stress testing for large banks led to reductions in credit to risky borrowers; Kay et al. (2014), who found that banks subject to the Durbin amendment experienced substantial declines in interchange income relative to exempt banks, though they offset more than 90 percent of the lost income through higher deposit fees);23 Alvero, Ando, Xiao (2023), who used bunching of banks around Dodd-Frank size thresholds to estimate the costs of the act's regulatory burdens; Bindal et al. (2017), who studied the effects of the $10 billion and $50 billion thresholds that trigger increased bank merger scrutiny; and Wood (2023), who examined how the 2005 amendments to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act and the Community Reinvestment Act affected bank liquidity creation. In addition, many studies use regulatory thresholds to evaluate non-financial regulations.24 These examples demonstrate that ex-post evaluation can provide insights at a limited marginal cost when rules apply differently across otherwise comparable firms. Using tiered thresholds to identify the effects of regulations typically presents several challenges. Ideally, policy implementation would be unanticipated, preventing firms from strategically adjusting their behavior to remain out of scope√¢¬Ä¬îbut this is rarely the case in practice. Still, reducing activity to avoid regulation can be costly, limiting firms' ability to respond.25 And while firms may have some discretion in staying above or below a threshold, ex-post comparisons between those either side of the cutoff can still shed light on how rules affect firm behavior and incentives. Even when firms do not strategically avoid regulatory thresholds, anticipation effects may arise as firms adjust behavior well before formal implementation, in response to rules they expect to face because of speeches, draft proposals, investor pressure, or other signals. Such adjustments are especially likely when compliance is complex, time-consuming, and costly. A firm may also adjust in response to rules that currently apply only to others, anticipating that similar requirements will extend to them in the future. These dynamics complicate causal inference by blurring the timing of firm responses. A related phenomenon is the announcement effect, in which other entities respond immediately when information about rules is publicly disclosed. For instance, securities prices may adjust on the day a regulation is announced, regardless of when it takes effect. Both types of effects can complicate causal inference by shifting behavior away from the formal implementation date, but they differ in timing, observability, and the clarity of the policy signal that drives the response. Another challenge in using tiered requirements to identify policy effects is that certain thresholds trigger multiple regulations simultaneously. For example, under the Dodd-Frank Act, crossing the $50 billion asset threshold subjects banks to several prudential standards, including enhanced stress testing, liquidity, and risk management requirements.26 Because these requirements were implemented concurrently, isolating their individual effects is difficult. Nevertheless, even when multiple rules are triggered at once, comparing firms above and below the threshold can provide useful insights√¢¬Ä¬îespecially when estimating the most direct and distinct effects of a requirement, such as the impact of liquidity rules on holdings of high-quality liquid assets. In addition, when new requirements are layered onto an existing threshold, it may be possible to identify their marginal impact if the new rule was not anticipated at the time threshold was originally introduced. For example, while the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act established prudential liquidity requirements for large firms, a key element of the liquidity framework√¢¬Ä¬îthe net stable funding ratio√¢¬Ä¬îwas proposed in 2016, finalized in February 2021, and become effective in July 2021. Tiered application of regulations can support a long-term strategy of expanding regulations that demonstrate positive net benefits and scaling back or eliminating those that do not. Policymakers can (1) apply a rule initially to a narrow set of firms, (2) conduct an ex-post evaluation of the rule's costs and benefits, and (3) adjust the scope of the rule based on the findings.27 Arguably, certain expansions of banking requirements have followed this pattern. For instance, the long-term debt requirement for large banking organizations proposed in 2023 was influenced by the perceived successes of similar mandates for global systemically important banks introduced in 2016.28 Still, regulators could benefit from applying this approach more consistently, regularly reassessing whether to expand or narrow regulations in response to ex-post evidence. Staggered implementation, whether based on predetermined criteria or random assignment, is another common feature of rules that can support ex-post evaluation.29 Like tiering, applying a rule to similar firms at different times enables comparisons between early and late adopters, helping to assess a rule's impact. Therefore, regulators may benefit from using staggered implementation more often to evaluate the effectiveness of new policies. In some cases, staggered implementation has been deliberately designed to test policy effects. For instance, the SEC used staggered rollout in 2000 to evaluate the decimalization of stock market prices in 2000, and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) employed a staggered approach to distribute stimulus payments during the Great Recession.30, 31 Thanks to these clever implementation strategies, we now know far more about the consequences of these policies.32 In other cases, staggering implementation has resulted from practical considerations, such as prioritizing the most relevant entities or varying levels of readiness. For example, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's (FINRA) Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE), mandated by the SEC for broker-dealer trade reporting, was initially introduced in 2002 for investment grade corporate bonds with large issuances. Over time, its scope was expanded to cover a broader range of securities, including those with smaller issuances and lower liquidity. This gradual rollout enabled researchers to assess TRACE's effects by comparing securities subject to the requirement with those that remained exempt.33 Staggered implementation has also enabled policy evaluation in cases where the staggering was not intended for that purpose. For example, Bremer and Sommer (2025) evaluated the costs and benefits of the European emission trading regime using incidental variation in implementation timing. Similarly, Barreca, Neidell, and Sanders (2021) used staggered rollout to estimate the benefits of the U.S. Acid Rain Program. Comparable setups exist in U.S. policies on long-term care staffing and overtime protections, but, to our knowledge, no ex-post evaluations have yet exploited this variation.34 Staggered implementation has also been employed in bank regulation and by quasi-regulatory organizations in the private sector. Notable examples include the current expected credit losses (CECL) accounting standard,35 stress-testing requirements for large banks,36 and the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR).37 These staggered rollouts have enabled valuable ex-post analyses. Some examples include Loudis et al. (2021), who assessed the impact of early CECL adoption during the COVID-19 stress and found that reserves were substantially more responsive to the economic outlook among early adopters; and Banerjee and Mio (2018), who examined the staggered rollout of liquidity regulation in the UK and its effects on bank balance sheets. Staggered implementation also has limitations as a tool for policy evaluation. Because the units serving as controls are typically treated within a short time frame, often a year or two, analyses based on staggered rollout are more informative for short-term outcomes than for outcomes that depend on the long-term state of the regulation. For example, the decimalization of stock prices allowed researchers to assess impact on trading costs, which materialized quickly. By contrast, most banking regulations affect outcomes over longer horizons, and firms may begin adjusting their behavior in anticipation of rules before they take effect. Also, just as with identifying a regulation's effect through tiered application, possible anticipation and announcement effects limit how much staggered implementation can reveal about a regulation's true impact. For these reasons, evaluations based on staggered implementation require caution in interpreting results and modesty about the strength and generalizability of their findings. Although the staggered implementations of TRACE and CECL were not designed for evaluation purposes, they enabled valuable ex-post policy analysis. Like tiering, staggered implementation supports the evaluation of regulatory effectiveness and can inform iterative improvements. Problematic or costly implementations can be slowed or abandoned, while successful ones can be accelerated and expanded when early evidence indicates strong positive effects.38 A more modest alternative to randomized staggered implementation is the use of small-scale pilot programs, in which a regulation is applied, potentially on a voluntary basis, to a limited number of firms for a defined period. These pilots can reduce the cost of experimentation while providing useful comparisons between treated and untreated firms. The SEC has conducted several such pilots, including during the rollout of TRACE, the "up-tick" pilot (which removed a short-sale price test), and the "tick-size" pilot (which increased the minimum price increment for stocks from one to five cents). These experiments have generated multiple studies evaluating the effectiveness of the associated regulatory changes.39 However, the voluntary nature of many pilot programs can limit their value for casual inference (see Harris et al. (2021) for a discussion of these limitations in financial regulation). Beyond short-term randomized staggering, such as the decimalization of stock prices or the IRS stimulus payments, a long-term strategy for evidence-based regulation would involve more open-ended policy experiments using randomization.40 Randomly assigning treatments to comparable units remains the gold standard for identifying causal effects, which is why it has long been used in clinical trials. Experimental economics has similarly used controlled trials to explore economic questions in lab-like environments. Although fully controlled trials are rarely feasible in the context of firm regulation, regulators may still seek opportunities to adopt similar approaches where possible. Policy randomization can result in unequal treatment among regulated entities. Still, society accepts randomization in high-stakes decisions√¢¬Ä¬îsuch as the military draft, jury selection, and clinical trials√¢¬Ä¬îwhen randomization is grounded in ex-ante fairness.41, 42 Governments have also used randomization to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-poverty programs and the benefits of Medicare coverage.43 Credible evidence on policy effectiveness can require accepting some temporary inequities among regulated entities or individuals; this tradeoff may be justified when the resulting knowledge has the potential to substantially improve long-run outcomes. This does not mean that arbitrarily large inequities should be introduced solely for the sake of experimentation. Instead, the potential benefits of policy experimentation should be weighed against the potential costs associated with any resulting inequities. In general, policy randomization is more ex-ante justifiable when there is greater uncertainty about a policy's effects (including on the bottom line of regulated entities) and when the costs of unequal treatment are relatively low. Bank supervision is one area where policy randomization could be used to learn more. Given that appropriate baseline levels of supervision are in place, the incremental costs and benefits of different supervisory approaches could be studied through randomized assignment. For example, supervisors could test the efficacy of varying examination frequencies, team sizes and compositions, triggers for examinations, or areas of focus. Over time, such experimentation could help regulatory agencies allocate their limited resources more efficiently. The socially optimal scope of a regulation may not align with the scope that best enables evaluation of its effects. While employing a suboptimal scope for the sake of evaluation may involve some theoretical cost, there is generally little empirical evidence that current scopes of application are optimally efficient. Therefore, experimentation with regulatory scope may be feasible without demonstrable loss of efficiency at the outset. Even with greater use of randomization, pilot programs, tiering, and staggering, ex-post evaluation can be difficult for certain policies. As discussed earlier, the application of multiple regulatory requirements at the same threshold can challenge efforts to isolate individual effects. These challenges highlight the importance of designing policies with evaluation in mind: by embedding variation in implementation, improving opportunities for measurement, and reducing overlap across rules. Still, in practice, stakeholders may struggle to agree on a structure that is both legally defensible and cost-effective while also supporting rigorous ex-post analysis. When policies are implemented in ways that preclude meaningful evaluation, more fundamental concerns arise, including ethical ones. For example, Campbell (1969) argued, "To be truly scientific we must be able to experiment. We must be able to advocate without that excess of commitment that blinds us to reality testing." Similarly, Boruch (1975) warned that, "[A] failure to discover whether a program is effective is unethical. Insofar as a failure to obtain unequivocal data on effects then leads to decisions which are wrong and ultimately damaging, that failure may violate good standards of both social and professional ethics." Or as Karl Popper put it, "√¢¬Ä¬¶ we make progress, if and only if, we are prepared to learn from our mistakes: to recognize our errors and to utilize them critically instead of persevering in them dogmatically." (Popper 1957). Careful examination of policy effects helps ensure that government decisions are responsible, accountable, and guided by evidence. Dual reporting Identifying the costs and benefits of rules requires more than clear identification of treatment and control groups√¢¬Ä¬îit also depends on having good data, a concern sometimes overlooked in the rule making process. For example, the definitions of capital and risk-weighted assets have changed several times since the Dodd-Frank Act. Yet regulatory reporting typically requires firms to provide data only under the latest definitions, making it difficult to measure whether changes in reported capital or assets reflect changes in behavior or shifts in definitions. New rules can avoid this issue by requiring firms to report data using both old and new definitions for a limited time. This approach is similar to how banks report the value of securities under both mark-to-market and amortized cost valuations. Such parallel data proved invaluable in understanding the banking problems that emerged in March 2023, helping regulators identify banks with significant unrealized losses from interest rates changes that were not reflected in regulatory capital. Similarly, when revising questions in its Current Population Survey, the Census Bureau asks the old and new versions of a question to maintain consistency and data usability over time.44 Dual reporting can also be useful when the scope of a rule is being narrowed. Maintaining data from firms that were previously covered can help evaluate whether regulatory simplifications and burden reductions achieve their intended outcomes. Failing to collect overlapping data often creates problems. Famously, the Census Bureau changed its annual health insurance survey at the same time the Affordable Care Act was implemented, making it much harder to evaluate the law through ex-post analysis.45 Another example was the Bureau of Labor Statistics' 1994 introduction of the concept of discouraged workers and other major changes to the U-4 through U-6 unemployment measures.46 These changes made comparisons with earlier data more difficult and complicated analysis of laws such as the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. Dual reporting would temporarily raise compliance costs. Still, when reporting under old definitions can rely on existing systems, the marginal costs may be low. In such cases, the potential benefits of dual reporting are likely to outweigh the costs. Effective ex-post evaluation of rules can offer substantial benefits. This paper outlines two rule design strategies to support such evaluation. First, expanding the use of tiering, randomization, and staggered implementation can improve the identification of a rule's effects by creating treatment and control groups. Table 1 illustrates several applications of these techniques in public policy, showcasing how they can yield insights across a range of settings. Second, dual-reporting requirements√¢¬Ä¬îwhere both new and legacy data are collected during a transitional window√¢¬Ä¬îhelp distinguish the true effects of rules from changes in measurement. In addition, analysts tasked with ex-post evaluation could be brought into the rulemaking process early to help identify ways to enable meaningful evaluation. Once designing rules for ex-post evaluation becomes standard practice, policymakers and researchers are likely to discover more tools to support it. With a broader toolkit, many more ex-post evaluations will become possible. Many have argued that policymakers may resist this approach, worrying they have more to lose by exposing poor performing policies than they have to gain from highlighting successful ones (Wolf, 1979; Hogwood and Gunn, 1984; Twight, 1991; Weiss, 1993; Rossi, 1987; Hanson, 2003; Prendergast, 2003; Prendergast, 2007; and Bovens, Hart, and Kuipers, 2009). Policymakers may also be concerned about the costs of ex-post evaluations or worry that designing for evaluation could slow down the rulemaking process, delaying public access to well-crafted policies. Still, the benefits of strengthening ex-post evaluation are worth serious consideration. The regulatory community has managed the discomforts of ex-ante impact analyses by normalizing them. Today, nearly every major rule includes such an analysis, offering valuable information to both policymakers and the public. Similarly, normalizing ex-post evaluation could reduce the stigma of admitting that some rules underperform, and in turn encourage more independent, timely, and accurate evaluations. Better ex-post evaluation would help the public understand the real impacts of government policy√¢¬Ä¬îand support reform or repeal of rules that fall short.

Two key laws here are the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995. The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to consider the impact of their rules on small entities. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act requires agencies to assess the costs and benefits of any regulation that has a material impact on state, local, or tribal governments. Both laws define agencies according to Title 5, Section 551(1) of the US Code; however, the Regulatory Flexibility Act includes independent regulatory agencies, while the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act excludes them.

Return to text 4. Historically these requirements did not apply to independent regulatory agencies. However, recently issued Executive Order No. 14215, 90 Federal Register 10447 (February 24, 2025) mandates that "√¢¬Ä¬¶all executive departments and agencies, including so-called independent agencies, shall submit for review all proposed and final significant regulatory actions to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA)√¢¬Ä¬¶" along with their cost-benefit analyses. OIRA traditionally reviews agency submissions of the potential costs and benefits of "significant" rules (Congressional Research Service, 2024). Return to text 5.

Alessandro, Cardinale, Lagomarsino, Scartascini, and Torrealday (2019) show that government transparency, and particularly transparency about government performance (e.g., implementing effective rules) promotes citizen confidence in government. In a metanalysis of 49 studies, Qiushi and Guan (2022) show that government transparency has a positive and significant effect on citizen trust in government. Return to text 14. See Herrick and Sarewitz (2000), Kovacic (2006), and de Jong et al. (2018) for a discussion of the benefits of ex-post evaluation of policies in the context of environmental policy, competition policy, and infrastructure projects, respectively. Return to text 15. The Department of Energy previously highlighted a related motivation, stating that it would "consider how regulations might be designed and written" to better support retrospective evaluation and measurement of outcomes (DOE 2011). Although DOE's subsequent actions regarding this specific goal are uncertain, our work explicitly advances this approach. Return to text 16. Even with this separation of drafting and analysis roles, both sets of analysts ultimately answer to SEC leadership. Skeptics could still justifiably worry about the analysts' independence when they have the same bosses. Return to text 17. The typical identification assumptions used in measuring the effects of regulations do not require that firms be "similar." Rather, the (partly non-testable) assumptions needed for causal identification are exchangeability (i.e., there is conditional mean independence of treatment and control units), positivity (i.e., the probability of a unit being treated is positive but below one), and stable unit treatment value (i.e., potential outcomes of each unit are unaffected by the treatment assignment of other units). Similarity of treated and control units is one way to satisfy these assumptions but is not necessary. A potential objection to using differentiated application of regulations to similar firms to identify treatment effects is that, by changing the conditions of competition across firms, introducing a regulation for a subset of firms can also affect outcomes for the non-treated firms √¢¬Ä¬ì which would violate the stable unit treatment assumption. This is a potential limitation to consider when applying the identification methodologies discussed below. Return to text 18. Differentiated application of regulations is often mandated by statute. This article focuses on the ex-post evaluation of regulations issued by the executive branch agencies, but similar approaches can be followed by Congress to evaluate the effectiveness of statutes ex-post. Return to text 19. In the banking regulation context, regulations with thresholds of application abound (see Congressional Research Service (2017) for a listing of all the thresholds that were in place at that time). Several regulations include enhanced requirements for large firms, complex firms, or both, including capital, liquidity, and resolution requirements. Return to text 20. Large banking organizations tend to pose proportionally more systemic risk to the financial system than smaller banking organizations (see, for instance, Lorenc and Zhang (2020)). Return to text 21. Given the same regulatory requirements, a firm with $1 billion in activity may be able to use the same system√¢¬Ä¬îand incur a similar absolute cost√¢¬Ä¬îas a firm that performs $2 billion of the activity. Return to text 22. France imposes numerous regulations on firms once they employ 50 or more workers, resulting in an unusually high number of firms with exactly 49 employees. Such "bunching" has been estimated to reduce French aggregate productivity by 3.4 percent of gross domestic product (Garicano et al., 2016). Return to text 23. The Durbin amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires the Federal Reserve to limit fees charged to retailers for credit card processing. Return to text 24. See, for example, Leonardi and Pica (2006) and Vaccro (2017). Return to text 25. For example, consider that the average domestic banking organization subject to Category III requirements had $550 billion in assets as of 2023:Q4. Given a typical return on assets of 1 percent, these banks would have to give up $3 billion in returns to be subject to Category IV requirements instead. Given observed growth in balance sheets, the current regulations have not caused banks to downsize in this way. Return to text 26. See Congressional Research Service (2017) and Labonte and Perkins (2017). The $50 billion threshold was generally increased to $250 billion in the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018. Return to text 27.

See Federal Reserve System (2016) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve System, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (2023). Return to text 29. The idea of using staggered implementation for causal identification has long been a standard practice in policy analysis (Meyer, 1995). The earliest reference we know of calling for expanded use of staggering to promote policy evaluation is Leuz and Wysocki (2016). Return to text 30. Between August 2000 and January 2001, the New York Stock Exchange, in a series of incremental steps, began trading and quoting all its listed securities in increments of a penny. See SEC (2000) for additional details. Return to text 31. The primary component of the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 was a $100 billion program of economic stimulus using tax rebates. The IRS implementation of this stimulus was randomized based on the last two digits of the filer's Social Security number. See Parker et al. (2013) for details. Return to text 32. Chung et al. (2004) studied the staggered roll out of decimalization. The Nasdaq Stock Market and the New York Stock Exchange have also performed ex-post analyses of this policy. As predicted, these analyses found that decimal pricing reduced bid-ask spreads. There were concerns the rule would reduce market liquidity, but the analyses failed to find evidence that liquidity declined. Chung, Lee, and R√∂sch (2020) and Werner et al. (2022) look at a related policy experiment involving a stratified random sampling process that assigned different quote and trading price increments in 2016 called the tick size pilot program. Parker et al. (2013) studied the effect of the staggered IRS roll out of the economic stimulus payments of 2008. This paper helped establish the efficacy of fiscal stimulus spending, finding a marginal propensity to consume of 50 to 90 percent in the first three months after stimulus payments were received. These results imply that such payments are highly effective stimulus. Return to text 33. See Bessembinder et al. (2006) and Goldstein et al. (2007). Return to text 34. The 2024 CMS staffing rule for long-term care facilities phases in nurse staffing minimums across facilities at different times, based on geographic and facility-specific factors, allowing for future comparisons across rollout cohorts. Similarly, the Department of Labor's 2024 overtime rule raises salary thresholds in two steps, creating a time-based regression discontinuity that could support evaluation of labor market effects. To date, neither rule has been the subject of published ex-post evaluation exploiting this variation. Return to text 35. The CECL accounting standard was required for entities that meet the definition of an SEC filer as of January 2020, and all other entities were required to adopt CECL by January 2023 (see Financial Accounting Standards Board, 2016). Return to text 36. Stress tests were initially implemented for the largest 19 banks in 2009 (under the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program) and later extended to all banks with more than $50 billion in total assets in 2013, following on the statuary mandate from the Dodd-Frank Act; see Board of Governors (2009, 2013). Return to text 37. In an implementation that combines staggering and tiering, the LCR was initially introduced for the largest firms in 2015:Q1, and, later, a modified LCR was applied to a set of smaller yet large firms starting in 2016:Q1 (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve System, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 2014). Return to text 38. This occasionally happens in medical trials where a treatment is so effective that the study is ended early over ethical concerns about denying potentially life-saving treatment to the control group. See Mueller, Montori, Bassler, Koenig, and Guyatt (2007) for a discussion of this issue. Return to text 39. See Harris et al. (2021) for a description of these and other pilot programs and for several references to studies that were based on these pilot programs. Return to text 40.

The Mexican anti-poverty program Progresa/Oportunidades was designed for evaluation using a randomized design. The ongoing program provides cash transfers to poor families based on school attendance and doctor visits (Parker and Todd, 2017). Due to lack of available funds to cover all eligible citizens, Oregon randomized who was covered by a Medicaid expansion in 2008, giving important insights actual benefits of government health insurance (Allen et al, 2010; DeVoe et al, 2015).

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang begins sale of $925M worth of Nvidia stock ‚Äî sale of 6 million shares barely dents his $123 billion in shares

How many leather jackets can this amount of money buy? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here‚Äôs how it works. The leather jacket-toting CEO sold 100,000 Nvidia shares last Friday and Monday, marking the start of a planned sale of up to six million shares announced in March of this year. The company‚Äôs stock price around that time hovered at $144.56 per share, meaning Mr. Huang just made nearly $15 million over the weekend. Nvidia recently hit a record stock price of $154.31, so the total sale, if the company‚Äôs stock price holds, is potentially valued at almost a billion dollars ‚Äî $925,429,000 to be exact. Despite that massive amount, it is but a drop in the bucket as his estimated net worth is $135 billion, says CNBC, putting him at number 10 on the Forbes list of the world‚Äôs richest people (at least at the time of writing). This sale was planned months earlier with the Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which helps avoid corporate insiders from being accused of insider trading. Huang‚Äôs timing is impeccable, though, as his stock sale started execution just as Nvidia‚Äôs value hit record highs. This also isn‚Äôt the first time that Nvidia‚Äôs C-suite has executed an 10b5-1 plan and benefited from its sky-high stock prices. Just last year, its executives and directors sold over $1.8 billion in Nvidia stock, with Jensen raking in $713 million in cash after selling six million shares ‚Äî the same amount planned for this year. Despite those sales figures, Jensen still owns a substantial amount of Nvidia. According to the SEC filing, he still has over 75 million shares in his direct ownership, plus another 783,375,400 shares owned indirectly through trusts and LLCs. Aside from that, he also received $49.9 million last year in total compensation, which was higher than the $44 million he received in 2023. Nvidia‚Äôs massive growth happened within the last couple of years, when the AI boom propelled its stock price to the stratosphere. Its stock price hovered around $5 in the late 2010s, before jumping to around $25 to $30 in 2021 due to the GPU shortages. It dropped back down to $15 in late 2022 before skyrocketing in the years after that due to AI advancements. By late 2024, Nvidia overtook Apple as the world‚Äôs most valuable company, making it worth more than Amazon and Meta combined.

Title: AMD's AI Moment May Be Coming. Will It Seize It?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. INDONESIA - 2025/06/16: In this photo illustration, the AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) logo is seen ... More displayed on a smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Algi Febri Sugita/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Advanced Micro Devices stock (NASDAQ:AMD) rose nearly 7% during Tuesday trading and approximately 15% year-to-date, as investor confidence grows regarding its role in the AI chip market, with several analysts raising their price targets for the stock. So what exactly has shifted for AMD in recent months? The AI semiconductor industry is vast and continues to grow rapidly. Nvidia has a stronghold in the market and has more than doubled its revenue over the last two years, with the data center GPU market exceeding $100 billion annually. However, AMD does not need to surpass Nvidia to further enhance its stock‚Äîit simply needs to increase GPU sales, and an opportunity may be emerging. In the past three years, the AI market has been characterized by significant investments from major tech companies and hyperscalers aiming to create the most advanced frontier AI models. These organizations have focused on performance and training speed, as training large language models necessitates substantial computational resources. This trend has favored Nvidia, which produces the leading chips available and possesses a well-established hardware and software ecosystem among major cloud service providers. Nonetheless, there is a genuine possibility that the rapid enhancements in frontier AI models will eventually reach a plateau. A broader array of AI workloads will transition to inference‚Äîessentially applying the developed models to real-world scenarios‚Äîwhere efficiency and cost are more critical than sheer computing power. This situation could represent a chance for AMD. Not all organizations require or can afford Nvidia‚Äôs premium GPUs. Many may choose older Nvidia models or more budget-friendly alternatives like AMD‚Äôs MI series, which provide adequate memory and solid performance for inference and fine-tuning of models. Additionally, open-source models like Llama from Meta may enable more companies to run their AI workloads on-site, decreasing dependence on costly cloud computing fees. This could also benefit AMD. Meanwhile, Intel is attempting to stage a comeback Can Intel‚Äôs 18A Break TSMC‚Äôs 2nm Stronghold? At its AI Day event, AMD introduced its MI350 series, set to launch in the second half of 2025, which it claims will deliver four times the AI compute capacity of its predecessor. The company also provided a preview of its MI400 and MI450 chips, furthering its evolving product strategy. Beyond hardware, AMD is developing its AI software and systems stack, positioning itself as a comprehensive AI provider‚Äîthrough its acquisitions of Brium, focused on compiler and AI software optimization, and Enosemi, specializing in silicon photonics. These strategies could also bolster AMD‚Äôs ROCm software stack, which follows an open-source, standards-based methodology, contrasting with Nvidia‚Äôs proprietary CUDA environment. This could attract enterprises seeking flexibility and lower costs for large-scale AI deployment. AMD recently announced a partnership with Oracle to make its MI355X GPUs available through Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, offering over two times the price-performance advantage compared to previous generations for large-scale AI tasks including inferencing. Nevertheless, risks persist. Cloud providers such as Google and Amazon are developing their own custom AI chips, which could restrict long-term demand for third-party hardware solutions. Nvidia may also intensify focus on more efficient mid-tier chips as the market shifts toward inferencing. Refer to our analysis on AMD Valuation: Is AMD Stock Expensive Or Cheap? for additional insights regarding AMD‚Äôs valuation and its comparison with competitors. The significant rise in AMD stock may restrict its potential in the near to medium term. Alternatively, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices), has produced impressive returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provides a proactive way to capitalize on favorable market conditions while limiting losses when the market declines, as discussed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

We all want to do awesome things and make an impact at work. However, what we call ‚Äúwork‚Äù is a relationship between employer and employee that‚Äôs inherently and persistently designed to benefit the former over the latter. How do we meaningfully contribute, earn a living, and maybe even enjoy ourselves when the organization simply does not care about us? It‚Äôs harsh, but that‚Äôs captialism, baby! Any organization (‚Äúorg‚Äù) exists for a purpose that‚Äôs greater than the individuals within it (e.g., profit, public service). We are a means to that end. Same goes for anything we personally get out of the arrangement be it salary, experience, foosball tables, or free lunches. This precarious and lopsided power dynamic manifests itself in our day-to-day in a variety of weird ways we often take for granted. Even if it never gets to something as extreme as layoffs or restructuring we still have to navigate this as best we can. We need to do our best work possible all while one tiny fact looms in the back of our minds. At the end of the day we‚Äôre just line items on somebody‚Äôs spreadsheet. One prevailing assumption that crumbles under the slightest scrutiny is that an org is a cohesive entity. We all know deep down it‚Äôs merely a collective made up of people, and yet we overlook this all the time. Heaven help us all if the company refers to itself as family. Ugh! If an employer ever says ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre like a family here‚Äù what they mean is they‚Äôre going to ruin you psychologically The head of the collective‚Äîexecutive leadership‚Äîisn‚Äôt a single brain. It could be 3, 5, or 7 brains all trying to act like a cohesive unit. But if you personally had 7 brains inside your head how do you think you‚Äôd come across to others? Companies are not rational actors. Anything an org does is just an emergent property of humans trying to work together. Organizations, especially large ones, are not optimizing for complete or perfect decisions. They‚Äôre optimizing for as much alignment and consensus as they can get to keep moving (sometimes by fiat). By necessity these decisions will always be suboptimal and that will infuriate workers who care about what they do. Most of these decisions will not make sense because we can‚Äôt interpret a collective action as if it came from an individual. Rich Gilbert nails it in his great video ‚ÄúCaring Less About Work can get us what we really want‚Äù: If you‚Äôre going to work and and you‚Äôre getting frustrated and you‚Äôre intelligent and you‚Äôre looking around at all the dummies around that are not making the right decision, that is by design. We can plead, ‚ÄúHow could they DO this?‚Äù or complain, ‚ÄúThis is a dumb decision,‚Äù but executive leadership really is at arm‚Äôs length to us and our work. Leadership lacks the detail we regularly see in the course of our work and they‚Äôre dealing in the abstract. Actions from leadership will therefore often feel extreme, sudden, swift, half-baked, reactive, fickle, or temperamental. The ultimate effect is that the org doesn‚Äôt care about us. One could even argue that it cannot care about us. An org is operating on another plane of reality entirely. Whatever it ‚Äúdoes‚Äù says nothing about the individuals along for the ride. We‚Äôre better off not trying to interpret its actions too closely, lest we break our brains. Most of the time Hanlon‚Äôs razor explains the dysfunction we see, but the nature of orgs can also provide temptation or cover for some willful disregard and gaslighting. A good example of gaslighting might be a lack of true upward mobility. Does the company promote often? Or does it say it will and then take forever to actually do it? How about raises‚Äîdo they even happen and how are they calculated? Does the company promote from within or does it recruit a higher position with a new joiner? That‚Äôs the carrot, but the stick is far worse! We‚Äôre always on the chopping block whether we know it or not. Not even management or the CTO are safe. Layoffs are ever-present and come in several forms. If we‚Äôre unlucky enough to work somewhere that does stack ranking (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Shopify) we can kinda sorta at least see it coming. Yay? Despite all evidence to the contrary CEOs absolutely love this shit. They definitely do not care who‚Äôs let go and for those who remain‚Äîuntil the next quarter‚Äîthey don‚Äôt care about the paranoia or distrust it causes. When I interviewed at Meta, they had me do interviews with four engineers, seemingly chosen at random from within the company. The last guy had been there by far the longest. I asked him ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it like to work there?‚Äù and he said ‚ÄúOh, working here will rewire your brain.‚Äù Maybe stack ranking is too cumbersome‚Ä¶ Probably best to just do layoffs arbitrarily. The company doesn‚Äôt even need to be in trouble! Entirely profitable companies can do layoffs, often more than once and with impunity. It‚Äôs a great flex for shareholders‚Äîso trendy that the stock price might go down if CEOs don‚Äôt do it. WTF? As Anil Dash notes this is more than just cutting costs: Big tech CEOs and VCs really love performing for each other. We know they hang out in group chats like high schoolers, preening and sending each other texts, each trying to make sure they‚Äôre all wearing the latest fashions, whether it‚Äôs a gold chain or a MAGA hat or just repeating a phrase that they heard from another founder. The ‚Äúreturn to office‚Äù push is another such trend. There‚Äôs no positive intepretation for it that has any basis in our post-2020 reality. Even supposing it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúquiet layoff‚Äù it‚Äôs still not good. Executives continue to poke this bear‚Äîup to a full 5 days a week in a physical office‚Äîand when we go along with it then the org knows it can do almost anything it wants to us. And perhaps the darkest trend in recent times is the holy grail for CEOs‚Äînot hiring people in the first place. when a leader says human workers are a source of ‚Äúbottlenecks‚Äù, and that automation is the source of ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù, pay very, very, very close attention If people think ‚ÄúAI‚Äù can meaningfully replace human developers, we‚Äôre in for a reckoning very soon. For one, we need junior developers and senior developers cannot exist in a vacuum. A generational talent gap is coming. For another, worsening software quality will erode and ruin companies. We‚Äôre left to ride this wave until orgs finally comprehend that developers do more than just produce code. Ahem, that last section got a little negative! However, a sober acknowledgment of the circumstances around us is the first step in loving our jobs. Yes, really. We can throw up our hands and lament that we‚Äôre just cogs in the machine, but I prefer to turn that idiom on its head a bit. It‚Äôs an apt metaphor. I‚Äôm just one gear of many. I have limited capabilities as do my neighbouring gears‚ÄîI can rotate clockwise or counterclockwise. When I do something my neighbours react in turn, and vice versa. We come in different sizes and shapes resulting in differences in torque transmission, rotational speed, and so on. My direct neighbours are very obviously cooperating with me as our teeth are interlocking. Conversely, the further away a gear is from me the less direct, and evident, our influence on each other becomes. The overall machine from my point of view begins to act strangely, resists me, or jams up completely. This actual machine would certainly be useless if it were real. The point is there‚Äôs little sense in struggling over the distant cogs but there‚Äôs plenty to focus on right around us. The concentric circles of concern, influence, and control, popularized by Stephen Covey, is a famous framework for personal effectiveness and decision-making that translates extremely well to the context of an org. The org overall is our circle of concern‚Äîit completely surrounds us but is so far removed that we can only observe and adapt to it in relatively minor ways. What this means is we can put the overall organization and its shenanigans in the back of our minds while we optimize our local relationships and maximize our job satisfaction with real people and meaningful tasks. This is within our circle of influence. Namely, this is our manager, our reports, and our peers or teammates. We should figure out what our manager needs in order to perform their job and then become their ally towards those causes. This feedback loop builds trust very quickly and we‚Äôll feel more empowered. Our boss also acts as a ‚Äúcanary in the coal mine‚Äù‚Äîif they‚Äôre comfortable in the org maybe we can be, too. Quick note: the advice above only works if our boss is a true leader and has our backs. If they‚Äôre driven by ego or more interested in licking executives‚Äô boots, fuck 'em. If we ourselves have direct reports, then we practice servant leadership and put as much energy into these relationships as we can. Listen to them every day, figure out what they need, and collaborate with them on those actions. I know I became the leader I am today thanks to my reports. Obviously we spend most of our time with our fellow developers, designers, architects, QAs, product managers, analysts, and so on. These are the people, on a daily basis, that we want to impress and be impressed by. Ideally, they‚Äôre just plain fun to hang out with, too! Never underestimate how much job satisfaction can be derived from the mutual respect and admiration among people who like each other and are operating at the top of their game. This is the real company that we work for, as it were. It‚Äôs a subset of the overall org that we can readily interpret because none of it is abstract. It also means we don‚Äôt have to withdraw or disengage under the crushing weight of organizational nonsense. There will always be a venue where we can practice core principles‚Äîempathy, support, excellence, collaboration, camaraderie‚Äîand that means we can still grow our careers and our networks. Once we‚Äôve drawn our local boundaries we know where to best apply ourselves. However, we also need to understand our individual boundaries, or rather how much we apply ourselves. This is within our circle of control. We start by not volunteering at work. We already have a job that we get paid for, so anything beyond that is extra work and in case I haven‚Äôt been clear so far‚Äîthe org won‚Äôt care. Despite our best intentions, such work will be thankless and the law of diminishing returns will slap us in the face so hard we‚Äôll get whiplash. We can do ourselves some serious lasting damage if we don‚Äôt exercise a healthy level of self-discipline. If you push yourself to your limits and burn out for a company, you are trading years of your future productivity for minor gains in the present. This isn‚Äôt the same as coasting, holding back, or phoning it in. There are plenty of ways to do a lot of good work within our circle of control. Indeed, it‚Äôs the only thing we truly control‚Äîapplying our skills and abilities and getting direct satisfaction from that. There will always be times where we feel an urge to do more than asked, show some initiative, or simply seek appreciation from those beyond our circle of influence. We can indulge these urges, if we want, but we must be mindful. Whenever we‚Äôre doing extra work it should be clear to us why we‚Äôre doing it. The simplest (and least likely) reason to ‚Äúvolunteer‚Äù ourselves is because the org compensates us for it. What? It could happen! Maybe. Telling my boss ‚Äúyes,‚Äù when they asked if I speak Spanish fluently and following it up with, ‚Äúbut not for free,‚Äù has been the highlight of my day, so far. Alternatively, we can ‚Äúcompensate‚Äù ourselves. We can always do extra work as long as we‚Äôre getting something out of it. This runs the gamut from acquiring a new skill to optimizing an annoying workflow bottleneck to securing our team‚Äôs delivery of a long-awaited feature. Whatever the reason or result, any extra work is a courtesy we extend to ourselves or our circle of influence. We should always assume that only we (or our teammates) will appreciate it. If that‚Äôs not enough to justify the effort then we don‚Äôt do it. This threshold of what constitutes extra work (or if we should do it) will be personal. The calculation will vary per person. Some can tolerate a great deal if the pay is good, while others can‚Äôt. Others will risk burning themselves out doing small favors for everybody, and others won‚Äôt. To each their own, I say. We can‚Äôt feel guilty or less of ourselves when we see somebody else‚Äôs circle of control is different than our own. We can only define it for ourselves and work happily within those confines. We should be careful about counting any vague, top-down forms of recognition as fair exchange for extra work or validation that we‚Äôre doing a good job. If we‚Äôre doing great work everyone will know because our circle of influence (manager, reports, peers) will be singing our praises. Word will spread. We don‚Äôt need to actively seek out credit or accolades by trying to do more. Either way, the slippery slope here is that an understanding of your contributions loses valuable detail at the org level. By definition, the wider our reputation the less control we have over its interpretaton. The org doesn‚Äôt care about us, so when all is said and done even the brightest star at the company will still be a resource. If you always deliver, they‚Äôll always lean on you. And the more efficient you are? The more you get exploited. This perverse form of ‚Äúrecognition‚Äù could backfire on us in several ways. We might become the subject matter expert for some arcane legacy system or a new feature that requires constant maintenance. We risk getting typecast as ‚ÄúThe Only Person Who Knows How To Do X‚Äù. We‚Äôll get saddled with an additional workload or a new role we don‚Äôt actually have the bandwidth for. Again, we might actually be OK with such recognition‚Äîsome could be legitimate career opportunities‚Äîbut let‚Äôs not fool ourselves into thinking it‚Äôs true gratitude on the part of the org. However much we ingratiate ourselves with the org nothing is guaranteed. Despite the many YouTubers who naively pontificate on how to become recession-proof or dodge layoffs whenever the org flinches, no single company is going to save us. We have to be ready to save ourselves, and at any moment. This means job seeking on a casual and continual basis. Treat it like a hobby. Yes, even if we have a job already. And yes, even if we love that job. Think of the activities we do almost exclusively when we‚Äôre between jobs and do them on a smaller scale more regularly. Keeping our resume up to date, for instance, is far easier if we document our accomplishments as they happen. We can also practice other activities like staying in touch with colleagues, researching companies and their cultures, attending meetups or networking events, and even doing interviews! A low key job search can help in a few ways. For one, should we suddenly find ourselves unemployed we‚Äôre better prepared. We‚Äôve already done some of the legwork that‚Äôd feel much harder to do in the moment. Any practice we‚Äôve done also comes across as confidence to potential recruiters and interviewers. Second, it‚Äôs a chance for introspection and self-awareness. We‚Äôll come to know more clearly what we like or dislike about our current job. It will also help to identify what we‚Äôre capable of and what we expect of ourselves or others. Useful for future jobs, yes, but this understanding makes us better at our current job, too. If nothing else, it might just cheer us up from time to time. I‚Äôve had more than one Very Bad Day that found me cruising jobs on LinkedIn during my lunch break. And at one particularly toxic company I had a draft resignation letter open for a couple of months. Whenever the job wore me down I‚Äôd edit it a bit more. You know, as a treat! By the time I actually sent that letter it was bulletproof and very satisfying. Ultimately, proactive job seeking like this provides us with confidence, autonomy, and options. I‚Äôve tried very hard to describe organizational behavior on its own terms and not as the deliberate intent of specific people. Just like us, executives have a role to play as part of the org, too. They may benefit from the system more than we do but they‚Äôre subjected to it all the same. Your CEO might actually be a nice human being. Most of them are! Elon Musk, on the other hand, is a demon wearing a meat suit. It‚Äôs the billionaires‚Äîand leaders who emulate them‚Äîthat we need to worry about. So, I don‚Äôt have any useful advice for Musk, Bezos, Zuckerberg, or Altman. For anyone else in a leadership position I can only hope you looking into every nook and cranny of your org, seeing the people working for you, and doing right by them as best you can. I‚Äôll admit I started writing this while in a somewhat bitter mood. However, it was a good exercise in helping me firm up some positive and actionable lessons. I find it reassuring that how I navigate an org doesn‚Äôt have to contradict my personal principles or how I work. In fact, they‚Äôre the very tools I need. I firmly believe that we can find a way to exist‚Äîflourish, even‚Äîwithout the org eroding our personal values. We don‚Äôt want to be naive, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we just give in to cynicism. I hate my job. The work sucks. The people suck. The pay sucks.looks up and sees motivational poster on wallWell this changes everything The steps seem simple enough. Make peace with the fact that any org is an irrational entity that always exists on the periphery. Focus our attention and effort on our circle of influence. Maintain rigorous and healthy personal boundaries. Always be ready to move on. It sucks that we have to do so even if we like where we work or feel like we‚Äôre doing well. It‚Äôs human nature to worry less about our well-being when the risks or costs are not evident or immediate. However, things are lovely until suddenly they‚Äôre not. Protect yourself. My promise to you is that there will be far more good days than bad days. Ultimately, the fact that your job doesn‚Äôt care about you is liberating! It‚Äôs not personal. You do you. My promise to myself is that I‚Äôm going to spend less time accommodating the company and more time empowering myself. Less time worried about what the CEO thinks and more time worried about how my coworkers feel. Less energy trying to save the world and more time simply being proud of myself and my work. We all want to do awesome things and make an impact at work. However, what we call ‚Äúwork‚Äù is a relationship between employer and employee that's inherently and persistently designed to benefit the former over the latter. How do we meaningfully contribute, earn a living, and maybe even enjoy ourselves when the organization simply does not care about us? Matt Hogg FYI Web developer. Technical leader. Husband. Father.

Archives Increased sea-level contribution from northwestern Greenland for models that reproduce observations, Badgeley et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences The Greenland Ice Sheet has been thinning over the past several decades and is expected to contribute significantly to sea-level rise over the coming century. Ice flow models that make these projections, however, tend to underestimate the amount of mass lost from the ice sheet compared to observations, which complicates adaptation and mitigation planning in coastal regions. Here, we constrain a model of northwestern Greenland with a time series of satellite-derived surface velocity data and time-dependent physics to infer unknown ice properties. The model reproduces observed mass loss over the past 13 y within uncertainty. This model‚Äîconstrained by more data‚Äîleads to about 8 to 17% greater sea-level rise contribution from this region by 2100. Evidence of Emerging Increasing Trends in Observed Subdaily Heavy Precipitation Frequency in the United States, Mascaro et al., Geophysical Research Letters The magnitude and frequency of heavy precipitation are expected to increase under warming temperatures caused by climate change. These trends have emerged in observational records but with much larger evidence on a daily rather than a subdaily scale. Here, we quantify long-term changes in heavy precipitation frequency in the United States using hourly observations in 1949‚Äì2020 from 332 gauges. We demonstrate that, when analyzed collectively, the frequencies of heavy precipitation at multiple durations from hourly to daily exhibit an increase that cannot be explained by natural climate variability. Upward trends are significant at ‚àº20%‚Äì40% of the gauges throughout the country except for the coastal western and southeastern regions, with higher percentages for longer durations. We also show that the frequency of hourly heavy precipitation has mainly grown after ‚àº2000, thus explaining the limited evidence of trends at the subdaily scale reported in past studies. Giuseppe Mascaro thanks funding from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) awards #2212702: ‚ÄúCAS-Climate: A Novel Process-Driven Method for Flood Frequency Analysis Based on Mixed Distributions‚Äù and #2221803: ‚ÄúCollaborative Research: CAS‚ÄîClimate: Improving Nonstationary Intensity-Duration-Frequency Analysis of Extreme Precipitation by Advancing Knowledge on the Generating Mechanisms.‚Äù Battery electric vehicles show the lowest carbon footprints among passenger cars across 1.5‚Äì3.0 ¬∞C energy decarbonisation pathways, ≈†imaitis et al., Communications Earth & Environment Passenger car carbon footprints are highly sensitive to future energy systems, a factor often overlooked in life cycle assessment. We use a time-dependent prospective life cycle assessment to enhance carbon footprints under four 1.5‚Äì3.0 ¬∞C decarbonisation pathways for electricity, fuel, and hydrogen from an energy-based integrated assessment model. Across 5000 comparative cases, battery electric vehicles consistently have the lowest carbon footprints compared to hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and fuel-cell vehicles. For example, battery electric vehicles show an average 32 to 47% lower footprint than hybrid combustion in 3.0 ¬∞C and 1.5 ¬∞C climate-compatible futures, respectively. This is driven by greater projected decarbonisation of electricity compared to fossil-dominated fuels and hydrogen. Battery electric vehicles meaningfully retain their advantage for mileages over 100,000 km, even in regions with carbon-intensive electricity since these are anticipated to decarbonise the most. Although our study supports battery electric vehicles as the most reliable climate-mitigation option for passenger cars, reducing their high manufacturing footprint remains important. Can dissent be meaningfully measured in an overwhelming consensus? A citation network case study in climate change research, Grunert, PLOS Clim ate In scientific discourse, the prevalence of overwhelming consensus obscures the presence of dissenting views as well as their characteristics. This paper explores the potential to meaningfully measure dissent within the context of such a consensus, using climate change research as a case study. Using citation analysis to explore the dynamics of scientific publications and the reception of dissenting opinions, this project questions whether there may be a methodological framework for quantifying dissent. This study employs analysis of citation networks to assess the visibility and impact of minority viewpoints, as well as the viability of such a study. The findings indicate that because dissent in climate change research is miniscule such measurements are limited. Despite that finding, researchers on the fringe of scientific consensus have an outsized impact on social viewpoints. This project has potential to disrupt the ways researchers critically consider the relevance of dissenting research in their own fields, and to think of ways to embrace the impact of research that expands their fields. In the face of anti-science politics, silence is not without cost, Editors, Nature We recognize that not all scientific leaders are in a position to be able to speak out, particularly those in countries where doing so could incur a penalty ‚Äî or even punishment. That is why our call is to international scientific organizations. Academies in countries where the freedom to dissent is protected should also make their concerns known. All need to be aware that silence is also not without cost.

Title: Xbox and Meta officially release limited edition black and green Meta Quest 3S bundle

Though if you want a quality VR headset, perhaps saving for a Quest 3 is a better plan. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here‚Äôs how it works. A few days ago we were treated to a sneak peak of the recent collaboration between Xbox and Meta Quest. The Xbox themed virtual reality headset was leaked by a BestBuy employee earlier this week, but now the official news blast is out. This limited edition black and green Meta Quest 3S is now available for purchase on Meta's website, or at Best Buy for folks in the USA, Argos and EE for UK readers. The headset looks almost exactly how we pictured it, harkening back to the original Xbox design. The matt black finish is highlighted with vibrant green trimmings, which I have to admit do look pretty cool. There's something to a VR setup that's giving Matrix aesthetics, just as long as I don't also have to be held in a weird gooey egg thing while machines harvest my life force. The headset would have to be a little bit cooler before I sign up for that. The special Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition bundle is going for $400 USD, but includes a bit of extra kit. Alongside the black and green 128 GB Meta Quest 3S, you also get Meta Touch Plus controllers, a limited-edition Xbox Wireless controller, and a Meta Quest Elite strap all themed to match. Alongside the bundled hardware are also a couple of subscriptions to help let you try out some VR games. You get 3 months of Meta Horizon+ and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to try. This will let folks try games like Asgard's Wrath 2, which has been a highlight for VR gamers since its release. Judging by the included Xbox Wireless controller, this bundle isn't intended to limit folks to VR games on the headset. Instead it looks designed to be used as sort of theatre room replacement, where you can play all your Xbox games from the comfort of your headset. It's also worth noting if you already have GamePass these extra 3 months should stack and give you a bit of extra time on your subscription. The thing about this bundle I struggle with, however, is you'll never see it when using it. Half the joy of a limited edition fancy looking console or controller is looking down at it and smiling smugly to yourself during use. Thinking how it's cool that you have this nifty version of a thing you love that's just a little bit different to what's out there. This is really hard to do while wearing a VR headset. If you are keen on this collaboration, you might want to get in fast; stock is said to be super limited for this bundle. Personally, I'd forgo this and work on getting a full Quest 3 instead. Those heightened specs are well worth the price difference‚Äîwhich is why that's our pick as best VR headset right now‚Äîand that's certainly more beneficial than a black and green colourway.

Œî The rise took the company‚Äôs market cap to about $3.75 trillion, making it the world‚Äôs most valuable company, ahead of Microsoft, CNBC reportedWednesday. The increase in Nvidia shares was driven by the company‚Äôs latest earnings results, which showed robust growth and potential for future strength, according to the Bloomberg report. While Nvidia faces restrictions on selling advanced semiconductors in China, the company also has big customers like Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon that are aggressively building artificial intelligence infrastructure, the report said. The company‚Äôs stock price has risen 14% this year after rising 170% last year and leaping 240% in 2023, per the report. Wall Street remains optimistic about the stock because it is showing both high growth and a reasonable multiple, the report said. In a presentation released in conjunction with a shareholder meeting held Wednesday, Nvidia reported that its fiscal year 2025 revenue was up 114% year over year. At the meeting, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that in addition to AI, the company sees opportunities for growth in robotics, beginning with self-driving cars, according to the CNBC report. ‚ÄúWe have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest, representing a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,‚Äù Huang said, per the report. Huang added that the business unit that includes automotive and robotics was up 72% on an annual basis and accounted for 1% of the company‚Äôs total revenue in the latest quarter, the report said. Together with its AI chips, Nvidia has increasingly been offering related products like software, a cloud service and networking chips, according to the report. Huang said in the shareholder meeting that Nvidia no longer thinks of itself as a ‚Äúchip company‚Äù but rather as a provider of ‚ÄúAI infrastructure‚Äù or ‚Äúcomputing platform,‚Äù per the report. During a May 28 earnings call, Huang said Nvidia is pushing ahead with AI infrastructure projects worldwide to meet soaring demand for AI workloads. ‚ÄúThe age of AI is here, from AI infrastructures, inference at scale, sovereign AI, enterprise AI and industrial AI,‚Äù Huang said. ‚ÄúNvidia is ready.‚Äù Nvidia Shares Hit All-Time High as Companies Add AI Infrastructure Commerce Giants Expand Into Stores With New Debit and Credit Cards Fed Votes to Advance Proposal to Ease Banks‚Äô Capital Requirements Apple Reportedly Set to Propose Easier Access to Offers Outside App Store We‚Äôre always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. shares rose to an all-time high on Wednesday, with the leader in artificial intelligence chips extending an advance that has cemented its position as one of the most valuable companies in the world. The stock rose 3.8% to $153.46, taking out an all-time intraday high that has stood since January. The record is only the latest milestone for the company, which has risen 63% off an April low, a rally that has added more than $1.4 trillion to its market capitalization. Recent earnings results from Nvidia were the latest catalyst for bulls, as the report showed robust growth and pointed to more strength ahead despite the impact of restrictions on the sales of advanced semiconductors in China. Prints from Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. ‚Äî which together make up more than 40% of Nvidia‚Äôs revenue, per supply chain data compiled by Bloomberg ‚Äî further underlined how the company‚Äôs biggest customers continue to spend aggressively building out their AI infrastructure. ‚ÄúMy confidence in Nvidia‚Äôs growth is higher than it was a couple months ago, and it seems the AI arms race will continue through 2025 and probably 2026,‚Äù said Michael Smith, co-portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments. ‚ÄúThe momentum has clearly been re-established, and Nvidia‚Äôs moat has only widened and deepened, meaning its position has only strengthened.‚Äù At Nvidia‚Äôs shareholder meeting Wednesday, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang reassured investors that demand remains strong. He reiterated his view that the computer industry is only at the beginning of a massive AI infrastructure upgrade. Little known just a few years ago, Nvidia has emerged as a household name and perhaps the most important stock on Wall Street by becoming the poster child for all things AI. The shares‚Äô gain of more than 14% this year follow a rally of more than 170% in 2024, which itself came in the wake of 2023‚Äôs surge of nearly 240%. Even with this strength, it continues to screen as attractive next to its history by some valuation metrics. Nvidia trades at 31 times expected 12-month earnings, below its 10-year average and not far from the Nasdaq 100 Index‚Äôs multiple of 27 ‚Äî despite Wall Street estimates calling for faster growth at Nvidia than the broader tech market. The stock‚Äôs PEG ratio ‚Äî a measure of valuation relative to growth ‚Äî is at about 0.9, by far the lowest among the Magnificent Seven. The combination of high growth and a reasonable multiple is a key reason why Wall Street remains optimistic about its prospects. Nearly 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, while it trades 13% below the average analyst price target, suggesting many expect the momentum to continue. Despite all that, Nvidia remains under-owned by market professionals relative to other Big Tech peers, an additional sign there is potential for more buying in the weeks to come. Nvidia is owned by 74% of long-only funds, according to data from Bank of America. This puts it behind Amazon, Apple and Microsoft, which is the most owned at 91%. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bullish on this year and next, but like everyone else we don‚Äôt know what will happen after that,‚Äù said Smith. ‚ÄúThe stock doesn‚Äôt look expensive, but there can be a limit to how much upside there is in one of the biggest companies in the world. Ultimately the duration of Nvidia‚Äôs growth will depend on how long its customers increase their investments in AI. If they slow their spending, it won‚Äôt take much to see a big shift in volatility.‚Äù (Updates with shareholder meeting in fifth paragraph.)

Title: Nvidia shares hit record high as Wall Street shakes off anxiety about AI chip export controls
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/06/25/business/nvidia-shares-hit-record-high-as-wall-street-shakes-off-anxiety-about-ai-chip-export-controls/
Time Published: 2025-06-25T18:27:46Z

Nvidia shares closed at an all-time high on Wednesday as Wall Street investors shook off fears that US limits on chip exports to China would hurt the company‚Äôs business. Led by CEO Jensen Huang, the AI chip giant‚Äôs stock rose 4.3% to nearly $154.31 per share in Wednesday trading. Nvidia‚Äôs previous all-time closing high was $149.43, which was achieved last Jan. 6 following President Trump‚Äôs election win. The stock is up about 15% since the start of the year. The surge pushed its market cap to $3.76 trillion, establishing Nasdaq-listed Nvidia as the world‚Äôs most valuable company. Microsoft, a key Nvidia customer, ranked second at $3.65 trillion, followed by Apple at approximately $3 trillion. The rally has occurred despite lingering investor anxiety about President Trump‚Äôs move earlier this year to slap fresh export controls on Nvidia‚Äôs shipments to China. The restrictions halted shipments of Nvidia‚Äôs H20 chips ‚Äì which had been the only AI processors it could legally export to the country. In May, Nvidia told investors it would lose $8 billion in expected sales from China. Huang himself has grumbled that the ‚Äú$50 billion China market is effectively closed to US industry.‚Äù However, overall demand for Nvidia‚Äôs chips remains strong. On Wednesday, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah raised his price target on Nvidia stock to $250 ‚Äì which, if achieved, would push its market cap to an unprecedented $6 trillion over time. ‚ÄúWhile it may seem fantastic that NVDA fundamentals can continue to amplify from current levels, we remind folks that NVDA remains essentially a monopoly for critical tech, and that it has pricing (and margin) power,‚Äù Baruah said in a note to clients. For the full year, Wall Street expects Nvidia‚Äôs revenue to surge 53% to nearly $200 billion, according to LSEG data. Nvidia shares popped despite mixed results for Wall Street‚Äôs main indexes. The Nasdaq was up about 60 points, or 0.3%, while the broad-based S&P 500 was flat and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 106 points, or 0.3%. The firm dominates the market for advanced computer chips needed to power energy-guzzling artificial intelligence models. Aside from Microsoft, Nvidia‚Äôs customers include the likes of Sam Altman‚Äôs OpenAI, Elon Musk‚Äôs xAI and Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs Meta. The Santa Clara, California-based firm also held its shareholder meeting on Wednesday.

Title: Score a 512GB Meta Quest 3 headset with FREE $50 Best Buy gift card today at $500

Hot on the heels of Meta‚Äôs Xbox-edition Quest 3S headset debut, Best Buy is offering a FREE $50 gift card with the 512GB Quest 3 unit at $499.99 shipped. This headset officially dropped to the $499 price point following the launch of the Quest 3S in September last year and hasn‚Äôt seen a direct cash discount since. However, today‚Äôs deal on Best Buy effectively gives you a $50 discount by including a FREE $50 gift card that you can use toward other purchases. Today‚Äôs offer essentially lets you have this headset for $450, which happens to be the lowest we first tracked for it earlier this year with a similar FREE gift card offer at Amazon. Head below for more details. The Meta Quest 3 continues to be one of the top VR headsets in 2025, holding its ground even with the release of the newer ‚Äì but only slightly updated ‚Äì Quest 3S. It‚Äôs powered by the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor and features a sharp 4K+ display paired with immersive 3D audio. Interestingly, the original Quest 3 offers better display quality than the relatively newer Quest 3S.

As alleged in an underlying securities fraud class action complaint, DoubleVerify, via certain of its officers, failed to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify‚Äôs customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company‚Äôs technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify‚Äôs ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company‚Äôs high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify‚Äôs Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify‚Äôs competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify‚Äôs ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company‚Äôs profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify‚Äôs risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the above, Defendants‚Äô positive statements about the Company‚Äôs business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. Grabar Law Office is investigating whether officers and directors of DoubleVerify breached their fiduciary duties owed to the company.

Why? A recently filed securities fraud class action complaint alleges that Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ: MANH), through certain of its officers, provided investors with material information concerning Manhattan Associates‚Äô expected revenue for the fiscal year 2025. These statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company‚Äôs ability to forecast guidance despite macroeconomic fluctuations, the growth potential of their professional services offerings, and the ability for their cloud revenue to drive revenue for its professional services.The underlying complaint alleges that Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Manhattan Associates‚Äô forecasting ability for its professional services; notably, the Company was either not truly equipped to deliver ‚Äúresponsible targets‚Äù for growth or, otherwise, Manhattan Associates‚Äô services were not equipped to achieve such targets. Finally, the Complaint alleges that such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Manhattan Associates‚Äô securities at artificially inflated prices.

Key allegations in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint against the company and certain of its officers have survived a motion to dismiss. That complaint alleges that Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC), through certain of its officers and directors, made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Napco failed to address any material weaknesses with internal controls regarding cost of goods sold ("COGS") and inventory; (2) Napco downplayed the severity of material weaknesses regarding their internal controls; (3) Napco‚Äôs unaudited financial statements from September 30, 2022 to the present included ‚Äúcertain errors‚Äù such as overstating inventory and understanding net COGS, resulting in overstated gross profit, operating income and net income for each period; (4) as a result, Napco would need to restate its previously filed unaudited financial statements for certain periods; and (5) as a result, Defendants‚Äô statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. On April 11, 2025, the federal court determined that key allegations would survive Defendants‚Äô motion to dismiss the complaint. In so holding, the court determined ‚ÄúPlaintiffs have adequately stated Exchange Act claims by pleading scienter [knowledge of wrongdoing] through defendants‚Äô unusual stock sales and by plausibly alleging loss causation between the corrective announcement and stock price drop. Plaintiffs have also stated Securities Act claims against Napco and the underwriter defendants.‚Äù . . . ‚ÄúTaking the well-pleaded facts as true, there is no question that plaintiffs have adequately pled scienter. First, the stock sales were highly unusual in timing and amount. As to amount, the total proceeds of over $108 million from stock sales by the officer defendants weigh in favor of a motive. . . . And the officer defendants sold hefty percentages of their holdings ‚Äì 48.5% for Soloway and 45.5% for Buchel.‚Äù What To Do Now: If you have held Napco shares since before November 7, 2022 and would like to learn more about this matter, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H.

Title: Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan on how he shrugged off Trump‚Äôs accusations

Time Published: 2025-06-25T08:54:20Z
Full Content:
Diane Brady is executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative and Fortune Live Media. She also writes the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. Every time I‚Äôve seen Brian Moynihan over the years, whether it was at a press briefing after being called America‚Äôs worst big bank CEO early in his tenure or watching him get trashed by Donald Trump on stage at Davos, one word has come to mind: unflappable. Now in his 16th year as CEO of Bank of America, Moynihan plays the long game. In this week‚Äôs Leadership Next podcast, the man now considered to be one of America‚Äôs best big bank CEOs says he would have told his younger self to move faster at making change and to ‚Äústay strong, keep calm and carry on.‚Äù ‚ÄúI testified in Congress before I was CEO,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúand was told by the head of a House investigation committee ‚Äòthere‚Äôs no way you should be CEO of this company.‚Äô He didn‚Äôt think our company was any good or I was any good.‚Äù Flash forward a few years and that person was ‚Äúa good colleague‚Äù on other issues. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hold grudges‚Äù quips Moynihan, ‚Äúexcept as an Irish person for 100 years.‚Äù Growing up with seven siblings in Marietta, Ohio, Moynihan wanted to be a criminal lawyer like Perry Mason. Instead, he became a corporate lawyer for FleetBoston Financial, which merged with BofA in 2004. Tapped as CEO in 2010, Moynihan recently said he would like to stay until the stock price more than doubles to $100‚Äîwhich he seems confident about achieving in these volatile times. ‚ÄúYou need to be willing to step in and lead in good times and bad times,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúSome people wear that responsibility like a comfortable sweater and some people could never get into it.‚Äù As for that moment in Davos when Trump publicly accused him of refusing to do business with conservatives? ‚ÄúWhat you try to be is an energy giver, not an energy taker. So when you‚Äôre in a situation of pressure, how do you give people energy? By being calm and showing them a way to do something as a team and as a group that enables you to make progress.‚Äù That‚Äôs a quality he hires for, too: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre looking for people who can be calm at a point of attack,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWhen 210,000 team members look at you, they don‚Äôt want to see a person who‚Äôs going to panic. You may have nervous energy behind you or wonder in the middle of night, what the heck is going on? But if you show that and you let it eat at you, you can‚Äôt give energy.‚Äù You can listen to our full conversation on Apple, Spotify or YouTube. More news below.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com NATO on edge for Trump visit The president is in The Hague today for a top-level NATO meeting at which the military alliance is expected to confirm big increases in defense spending. On the way to the Netherlands, Trump cast doubt on the U.S.‚Äôs commitment to Article 5, the part of the NATO treaty that says if one member is attacked, all members must respond. ‚ÄúDepends on your definition. There are numerous definitions of Article 5. You know that, right? But I‚Äôm committed to being their friends,‚Äù he told reporters on Air Force One. Trump shares DM from NATO chief The president also posted on social media an obsequious personal message from NATO chief Mark Rutte welcoming him to the meeting. It calls Trump ‚Äútruly extraordinary‚Äù and says ‚ÄúYou will achieve something NO American president in decades could get done.‚Äù Read it here. Leaked Pentagon report downplays Iran bombing The U.S. air strike on Iran‚Äôs nuclear facilities did less damage than the president claimed and probably only set back their development by months, according to a leaked report from the Defense Intelligence Agency. The report suggests that although the entrances to the underground bunkers were caved in the facilities inside remain intact. Trump used social media to insist that the sites were ‚Äúobliterated.‚Äù Meanwhile, the ceasefire between Iran and Israel, briefly broken yesterday, seems to be holding. Judge rules against Jony Ive and Sam Altman A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against Ive and Altman‚Äôs io AI device venture, according to the FT. OpenAI was forced to take down a blog post announcing their deal because it may infringe upon a trademark established by iyO, a startup founded by Jason Rugolo, who is also pursuing a wearable AI device. Landmark AI copyright decision A U.S. District Judge has ruled that it was ‚Äúfair use‚Äù for AI company Anthropic to train its models on copyrighted books. That is, as long as Anthropic purchased those books and didn‚Äôt pirate them. Powell talks to Congress Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell told Congress on Tuesday that interest rates haven‚Äôt been lowered yet because the Fed predicts a ‚Äúmeaningful increase in inflation over the course of this year.‚Äù Powell notably declined to comment on President Trump‚Äôs policies during the Congressional hearing. Mamdani beats Cuomo in NYC mayoral primary Zohran Mamdani is a democratic socialist who wants to raise $10 billion by taxing businesses and the rich. CEO sentenced to prison for abuse of Rule 10b5-1 plan Former Ontrak CEO Terren Scott Peizer was given 42 months after a court found that his ‚Äúsafe harbor‚Äù stock sale plan had been set up to hide what amounted to insider sales.
