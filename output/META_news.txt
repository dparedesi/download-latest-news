According to pseudonymous Bitcoin analyst PlanC, the road to $1,000,000 per coin might look a lot less pronounced than many expect. PlanC floated the idea that, instead of sharp parabolic runs, Bitcoin could “slow-grind” higher — inching upward over the next seven years and quietly reaching $1 million by 2032. What if the earlier “Bitcoin cycles” were nothing more than the product of a retail-dominated, FOMO-fueled market? What if, from here on, Bitcoin simply slow-grinds up and to the right, with long, drawn-out, uneventful 10–30% corrections and consolidations? And every time we… — PlanC (@TheRealPlanC) August 31, 2025 PlanC argues that long stretches of sideways trading tend to fool people into thinking the cycle has ended and that crashes of up to 80% are coming. He suggested those deep wipeouts haven’t played out every time prices pause. Instead, he envisions recurring, drawn-out consolidations and corrections of roughly 10–30% — messy but manageable — that add up to steady gains rather than headline-grabbing rallies. Not everyone agrees. Jan3 founder Samson Mow has painted a very different picture. According to reports, Mow predicted an “omega candle” that could lift Bitcoin by $100,000 in a single day. $1M #BITCOIN ISN’T THAT MUCH GIVEN ALL THE MONETARY MONKEY BUSINESS GOING ON FOR THE LAST FEW DECADES pic.twitter.com/MzZZXi0mtD — Samson Mow (@Excellion) January 1, 2024 He told Magazine in June that $1,000,000 is “a given,” and he suggested the milestone could come this year or next. That view leans on the idea that sudden, extreme demand imbalances can still trigger explosive moves. Spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasuries are central to the debate. According to reports, several high-profile figures now predict Bitcoin will reach $1 million. Tom Lee has suggested it could hit that kind of figure or even $3,000,000 long term, while Michael Saylor has put $1 million on the table by 2035. Tom Lee says Bitcoin will experience a supply shock, and the $BTC price will reach $3,000,000. Do you agree with Tom Lee? Could Bitcoin experience a supply shock? Perhaps we can add $LUNC to this list.#Bitcoin #BTC #Bullish #TomLee pic.twitter.com/rhHT1yFXTj — TerraNewsEN (@TerraNewsEN) August 24, 2025 Asset managers have joined the chorus. Bitwise forecasts $1.3 million by 2035, pointing to rising US debt and a weaker dollar as drivers. Other voices include Robert Kiyosaki, who sees $1 million by 2030, and Cantor Fitzgerald analysts who also back the milestone. Timelines differ, but institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term case is clearly growing. Meanwhile, Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal warned that many treasury buyers use credit, and if credit spreads widen or risk measures spike, “strong hands” could be forced sellers. Market structure can change quickly when liquidity thins or macro stress appears. Reports have disclosed that institutional flows create a base of demand, but they don’t remove traditional market pressures. Some industry figures view a rapid ascent as a red flag. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz said on Aug. 17 that a million-dollar Bitcoin next year would likely mean the US economy was in serious trouble.

For now, the outlook splits between a blockbuster surge and a quiet climb. Whether Bitcoin delivers an omega candle or inches its way higher, the possibility of reaching $1,000,000 remains central to the debate. If PlanC is right, there may be no fireworks at all—just a steady grind that takes the coin to its milestone over the next seven years. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Asia’s richest tycoon has summoned all hands on deck to help him steer his $250 billion empire through the biggest geopolitical storm of its five decades as a public company. Friends and family answered Chairman Mukesh Ambani’s call. The CEOs of Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Walt Disney and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund showed up at Reliance Industries Ltd’s virtual annual general meeting (AGM) on Friday, together with he himself, his wife and three children. The 68-year-old patriarch, whose processing of discounted Russian oil seems at the heart of fraying US-India ties, needs all the support he can get. US President Donald Trump has sanctioned the most-populous nation with exorbitant 50% tariffs, allegedly for feeding Russia’s war machine. US officials have not directly accused Ambani. But when White House trade advisor Peter Navarro made a bizarre reference to the Ukraine conflict as “Modi’s war," he puts the largest single buyer of Russian oil in India in a pickle. Also Read: Andy Mukherjee: Why imports of American gas by Reliance make all-round strategic sense “I assure our respected prime minister that Reliance will follow his command with redoubled efforts," Ambani said at the AGM. That show of solidarity with Modi’s call for self-reliance is along expected lines. To say anything else may mean losing political influence. At the same time, though, Ambani can’t afford to annoy the US, which his conglomerate needs more than ever for capital and technology to break into the big league: $1 trillion-plus market valuation. A strategy to weather the squall began to emerge at the annual shareholder meeting last week. Ambani’s older son, Akash, has been tasked with delivering a mega IPO of the group’s digital services business, the world’s largest data firm with 500 million customers. During the pandemic, Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg were among the tech titans who pumped $20 billion into Jio Platforms Ltd. An IPO by June would strengthen the case for their further entanglement. Both made cameo appearances at the Friday event to back Ambani’s upcoming investments in AI. Google will provide cloud infrastructure, while a $100 million joint venture with Meta will develop AI solutions for local enterprises. Also Read: Transformer by Mint | Can Mukesh Ambani pull off a ‘Jio moment’ for AI? The Saudi wealth fund is an investor in both Jio and Reliance Retail. The biggest Indian retailer is not yet IPO-ready, but Isha Ambani, Akash’s twin sister, is building a consumer goods company that will eventually make the stuff that sells on Reliance’s shopping network. That’s where the media partnership with Disney, with 300 million paid subscribers and a near-complete lock on cricket, would come in handy as an advertising vehicle. Disney boss Bob Iger, too, sent in a video message for Reliance shareholders. However, the media business won’t be just about entertainment and commerce. New Delhi has long yearned for its own version of Qatar’s Al Jazeera, a tool to influence global opinion and signal India’s rise. Ambani is promising to step in to fulfil that ambition with news bureaus in major world capitals. This, too, is a message of support to New Delhi, which needs to find its way back into Washington’s strategic orbit even as it normalizes ties with Beijing. It’s also a timely move from a competitive standpoint. The rival Adani group’s legal troubles in the US are making it hard for it to beef up its international clout. Also Read: RIL AGM 2025 | Will Mukesh Ambani’s green push catch up with Adani’s head start? The most crucial project, however, has been given to Anant Ambani. The youngest scion has to attract the capital that Trump no longer wants for US solar and wind projects and create a renewables unit as big as Reliance’s oil-to-chemicals business in five to seven years. It won’t be easy to replicate a refinery operation that has churned out billions. The question is if the 30-year-old, who came to the AGM podium for the first time on Friday, can execute such an audacious pivot. The Adani Group, which has similar plans, will put up a tough fight. Here, the friends who attended any part of Anant Ambani’s wedding celebration last year might prove helpful. Among them is Yasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of the Saudi fund and a Reliance board member, is also the chairman of Saudi Aramco. The state-run oil producer had come close to investing in Reliance’s refinery in 2019. The deal fell apart two years later. Why not put it back on the table? A changed geopolitical landscape and the Saudis’ proximity to the Trump administration may offer a chance to direct Reliance away from Russian oil and towards West Asian crude and US gas, particularly ethane. A lacklustre stock price suggests that investors are sceptical of Ambani’s pledge to transform Reliance into a “deep-tech company." To prove naysayers wrong, now may be the time to dial down the group’s visibility.

The Campaign Podcast discusses how agencies are being affected by the increasing AI capabilities of media platforms and whether their role is under threat. Media companies including Meta, TikTok, X, Spotify, Pinterest and others have been advancing their AI capabilities to improve the process of creating and serving ads on their platforms. So where does this leave media and creative agencies? Meta has gone so far as to call itself a “one-stop shop” for advertisers, aiming to fully automate advertising, including the creation and targeting of ads, by the end of the year. After this was reported, Meta’s stock price went up, while those of Publicis, Omnicom, IPG and WPP all took a dip. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said: “Over the long term, advertisers will basically just be able to tell us a business objective and a budget, and we’re going to go do the rest for them.” In this episode of The Campaign Podcast, Campaign's editorial team discusses the threat posed by media platforms’ advancement of AI and how agencies are adapting to maintain their role in the advertising process. Hosted by Campaign's tech editor, Lucy Shelley, the episode features deputy media editor Shauna Lewis and UK editor Maisie McCabe.

September 02, 2025 00:52 ET | Source: Canyon Resources Limited Canyon Resources Limited PERTH, Australia, Sept. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HIGHLIGHTS Ore Reserves Estimate Upgrade Production – Staged development to reduce initial capital Economics1 Infrastructure Investor Webinar/ Conference Call Canyon Chief Executive Officer Peter Secker commented: “The compelling Definitive Feasibility Study outcome and Ore Reserves Upgrade will add to the significant momentum Canyon has achieved at Minim Martap. “We have a world-class bauxite Project on any measure, with scale, a quality resource, and a highly supportive jurisdiction backing a Project that represents a major economic opportunity for Cameroon. “With a project NPV of US$835M and IRR of 29%, in combination with a high grade 51% Al2O3 Ore Reserve places our product at the premium end of the market. “Our staged approach to the development, along with its highly competitive 1st Stage US$96M CAPEX, efficient mining process and US$140M debt financing in place, makes Minim Martap a compelling opportunity for our investors, and we look forward to taking them on an exciting journey with us through the Project’s execution and into production in H1, 2026.” A Media Snippet accompanying this announcement is available by clicking on this link. ASX Chapter 5 Compliance and Cautionary Statement The production targets referred to in this announcement are 100% based on Proved and Probable Ore Reserves estimated at the Project. The current Proved and Probable Ore Reserves utilises 144.0Mt over the 20-year mining plan, which represents a portion of 30% of current global Measured category Mineral Resources estimated at the Project. None of the Inferred category Mineral Resources underpin the production target. It is noted that there is a low level of geological confidence associated with Inferred Mineral Resources. There is no certainty that further exploration work will result in upgrading the Inferred Resources to Indicated status or that the production target itself will be realised. The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource Estimate have been prepared by Competent Persons, with Competent Persons Statements in Appendix 1. The DFS developed engineering designs to provide costs at a +/- 15% level of accuracy. The Company has concluded that it has a reasonable basis for providing the production targets, forecast financial information and other forward-looking statements included in this announcement. The detailed reasons for that conclusion are outlined throughout this announcement and all material assumptions, including JORC modifying factors (Appendix 3, JORC Table 1, Section 4) upon which the forecast financial information is based, are disclosed in this announcement. This announcement has been prepared in accordance with the JORC Code 2012 and the ASX Listing Rules. All material assumptions relating to production targets and financial forecasts are detailed in this report and the Ore Reserve Statement in Appendix 2 on page 47. Refer also to the further disclaimers and cautionary statements included before the Appendices to this announcement. Leading bauxite developer Canyon Resources Limited (ACN 140 087 261) (ASX: CAY) (‘Canyon’ or the ‘Company’) has released the updated Definitive Feasibility Study (‘DFS’) for the Company’s flagship Minim Martap Bauxite Project (‘Minim Martap’ or ‘the Project’), which confirms the Project’s strong economics and outlines a pathway for the phased development of what is planned to be a major new bauxite producer. The release of the DFS coincides with an updated Mineral Resource and results of an Ore Reserve Update for the Project. The Ore Reserve estimate has been increased by one third to 144Mt of DSO grade ore at 51.2% Al2O3 and 1.7% SiO2, and which will underpin the long-term future of Minim Martap. Located in Cameroon, Minim Martap will be executed as a capital-efficient, staged development by Canyon, with first ore production planned for Q1 CY2026 and first shipment to take place in 1H CY2026. Canyon has commenced early works for the Project, including the construction of the Inland Rail Facility (IRF) that will be used to transfer ore from road to rail, the upgrade of the haul road to transfer ore to the IRF and the procurement of long lead items such as locomotives for rail haul. The Company’s recently announced funding in the form of debt from AFG Bank Cameroon (AFG) (~US$140M), and equity from an options exercise by Eagle Eye Asset Holdings Pte Ltd (EEA) (A$25.4M) will fund long lead items and the Project’s Stage 1 CAPEX of US$96M. RESOURCE AND RESERVE UPGRADE The Ore Reserve estimation, conducted for the Minim Martap Deposit, adheres to the guidelines set by the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources, and Ore Reserves (JORC Code, 2012). The 2025 Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimate for the Minim Martap bauxite deposit as reported by SRK is presented below in Table 1. Pursuant to ASX Listing Rule 5.9.1, the Company provides the following summary in relation to Appendix 3 attached to this announcement. MATERIAL DFS OUTCOMES AND ASSUMPTIONS Economics Minim Martap has exceptional economics, based on its low CAPEX requirements, and efficient mining and logistics that are forecast at US$35/wmt. These factors combine to provide the Project with a pre-tax NPV of US$835M and an IRR of 29%. Figure 2 within the accompanying Media Snippet details the Project’s annual cashflows in real terms. Production Target The current 20-year mine plan and production schedule is based solely on the Proved Ore Reserve (JORC Code, 2012). The Life of Mine Plan (LOMP) provides a schedule of tonnes and grade for ore and waste over time for use in mining cost estimation and financial modelling. The LOMP only includes Proved and Probable Ore Reserves as a source of DSO material. Minim Martap can support elevated grades targeting 52% Al203 for the initial 3-year start-up period, before ramping up to 10 Million Wet Metric Tonnes/Annum of DSO product. The operation will commence at the Danielle Plateau to minimise the required start-up time and capital before transitioning to Beatrice and Raymonde later in the mine life to effectively manage the SiO2 in the product. SiO2 is maintained below 2% total SiO2 for the life of the mine. The start-up period of the mine, due to low rail capacity, will require low machine utilisation from the mining fleet and therefore offer reasonable flexibility and redundancy early in the mine life. Annual bauxite production schedule from the different plateaus of the Minim Martap Deposit is presented in Table 3. The bauxite recovered from the surface mining process does not require any additional processing. The surface miner crushes the ore to the required size as a part of the mining process and this ore is then exported as DSO. Mining method selected and other mining assumptions The selected mining method for the Minim Martap Deposit is the use of surface miners, supported by front-end loaders (FELs) and truck haulage. This method is proven, efficient, and cost-effective for bauxite extraction, with successful use in similar areas like Guinea. Run-of-Mine (ROM) ore will be transported to ROM pads and then off-site via an existing rail line. Waste material will largely be backfilled into the mined-out voids to support progressive rehabilitation, with minimal initial pre-stripping required on each plateau. Cut-off grades were applied to meet a target product specification of 51% Al₂O₃ and ≤2% SiO₂. For the Danielle and Raymonde plateaus, Al2O3 cut-offs were necessary to meet the average Al2O3 requirement. However, as these deposits are naturally low in SiO2, no further SiO2 constraints were required beyond the existing resource cut-off of 15% SiO2. In contrast, the Beatrice plateau contains high Al2O3 and did not require any Al2O3 cut-offs. However, it could not consistently meet the ≤2% SiO2 threshold without significant losses. As a result, material from Beatrice was permitted to exceed the 2% SiO2 target, provided it remained within the 2.5% low-quality SiO2 limit, with blending during production ensuring compliance with overall product specifications. The cut-off grades are summarized below in Table 4: Ore loss and dilution are applied within the mining models. The Danielle and Raymonde plateaus experienced limited impact from dilution due to their elevated Al2O3 cut-off; resulting in the application of a 25 cm loss and dilution approach, which aligns with the operational precision of the proposed surface miners. At Beatrice, a 0.7 m loss-only approach was applied to minimise the risk of reintroducing high-SiO2 material through dilution. The following losses were also applied to account for operational constraints: Mine to Port Infrastructure The development and sustaining capital of the project is detailed below. It comprises a mine camp and mine site infrastructure for Camalco personnel, a haul road construction from the ROM pad to IRF, IRF, Doula Port development, and railway rolling stock. To facilitate the start of this project, Camalco has committed to providing funding for a rail upgrade and will be reimbursed for these upfront funds through offsets against royalties and / or other charges. A working group composed of Ministry of Mines, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Economy & Planning, Camrail & Camalco is being set up to finalise the form and timing of this reimbursement. The Total Capital Expenditure for the Project is presented below in Table 5: Funding The Company currently believes that there are reasonable grounds to assume that the Project can be financed as envisaged in this announcement, on the following basis: Environmental Approvals The Minim-Martap Bauxite Project involves Extraction of DSO Grade Bauxite from the Minim Martap Deposit, transportation of Bauxite through haul road from the mine stockyard to the Inland Railway Facility (IRF) in Makor for bauxite evacuation, and the establishment of a port terminal at the Autonomous Port of Douala (PAD) for bauxite export. This necessitates comprehensive Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) to comply with national and international regulations. Separate ESIA studies have been conducted at Mine site, Haul Road, IRF and Port Area. Community The local community strongly supports Minim Martap, recognising the significant long-term economic benefits of the Project. Through the construction and operations of the Project, the Company expects to have a workforce comprised of 97 per cent local people. Along with the macroeconomic benefits of a major resources project for the Cameroon economy, Minim Martap will also contribute to the development of new economic infrastructure and improvements to existing infrastructure facilities. This includes roads adjacent to the Project area and the 800km rail link from the Company’s Inland Rail Facility to the Port of Douala. STUDY TEAM The Definitive Feasibility Study was completed by Canyon with support from specialist consultants as listed below: BAUXITE MARKET Canyon commissioned CM Group to provide an independent assessment of the outlook for the global bauxite market, including a price forecast for the specific grades of bauxite to be exported from the proposed Minim Martap mine in Cameroon. Forecast Prices for Minim Martap Bauxite Under Base, High and Medium Cases, 2026 to 2036 (US$/dmt real 2025, CIF China) is presented in Figure 5. For the purpose of establishing a long-term benchmark base case price, a freight rate forecast of US$17/Dry Metric Tonnes (dmt). Using this freight rate assumption, the base case long-term price forecast for Minim Martap bauxite is US$78/dmt CIF Shandong. NEXT STEPS 2025 2026 THE MINIM MARTAP BAUXITE PROJECT DEFINITIVE FEASIBILITY STUDY OUTCOMES AND ASSUMPTIONS 1.0 Executive Summary 1.1 Introduction Canyon Resources Limited (Canyon) is developing the Minim Martap Bauxite Project (the project) located in Central Cameroon, currently through its 100 percent owned subsidiary Camalco SA (Camalco). Following the grant of the Mining Permit for the Minim Martap mining areas, in accordance with Section 59 of the Mining Code, an entity of the State will be granted 10% ownership of the special purpose Joint Venture Company formed for that purpose, free of charge. The project is located approximately 800 km by rail, north-east of the Douala Port. The project is considered highly prospective for its high grade and low contaminant Direct Shipping Ore (DSO) Bauxite. Camalco aims to produce and export approximately 10 million tons per annum (mtpa) of bauxite utilising Cameroon’s established infrastructure facilities including railway corridor and ports. 1.1.1. Project Description Minim Martap is a Greenfield Bauxite Development project, with mining operations proposed to be undertaken at three (3) plateaus namely Beatrice, Danielle and Raymonde, using surface miners targeting the production of DSO bauxite product with a grade of approximately 51% total alumina (Al2O3) and ≤2% total silica (SiO2). DSO grade mined bauxite ore shall be transported by road for an approximate distance of 42 km to the rail head at the Inland Railway Facility (IRF) located at Makor. From there, the bauxite will be transported by rail to the Port of Douala before transshipment to ocean going capsize vessels. A schematic representation of the project is presented in Figure 1-1 within the accompanying Media Snippet. The proposed project caters for the systematic extraction of Bauxite ore and its transportation, achieved by the upgrading of critical existing facilities including development of a road network from the mine to the existing rail facility 5km south of Makor, revamping of the rail network and development of port infrastructure facilities. This will have a positive impact on the Socio-Economic Development of the local inhabitants along with the generation of a significant amount of foreign exchange by selling of International standard DSO Grade Bauxite ore. For the purpose of preparation of the Detailed Feasibility Study (DFS), Camalco has appointed various agencies to conduct relevant testworks /studies, as presented below in Table 1-1. Table 1-1 - Agencies Involved for Conducting Various Studies DASTUR Engineering International GmbH in association with M. N. Dastur & Company (P) Ltd. (DASTUR) has been mandated by Camalco to integrate the DFS for this project based on the studies conducted by various agencies as mentioned in Table 1-1 above. 1.1.2. Project Location The Minim Martap Bauxite Project is made up of three (3) tenements referred to as Minim Martap, Makan, and Ngaoundal all located within the Vina and Djerem Departments of the Adamawa region in Central Cameroon. The proposed mining areas, defined by the strategic scheduling and pit designs, are within three (3) plateaus (Danielle, Beatrice, and Raymonde) of the Minim Martap Mining/Exploitation Permit as shown in red in Figure 1-2 within the accompanying Media Snippet. 1.1 Geology, Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve Estimation 1.2.4. Geological Overview The project area is located within the Central Cameroon Shear Zone (CCSZ), which is a major northeast–southwest trending structural feature that separates the North-West Cameroon Domain to the north from the Adamawa Domain to the south. The bauxites were formed from the lateralization of the Cambrian granites. Subsequent erosion has resulted in the current landform of flat-topped plateaus separated by deeply incised valleys, with the bauxites occurring within remnant laterites on the plateau tops. The plateaus are very irregular in shape and, especially those in Minim Martap, are significantly elongated subparallel to the structural trend of the CCSZ. The plateau tops are generally quite flat, but the flanks are usually relatively steep. The laterite profile typically comprises a thin soil covering, an iron-rich capping, a leached horizon where the removal of silica and iron has resulted in the residual enrichment of bauxite minerals, and a kaolinitic basal clay horizon. Most of the bauxite Mineral Resource is contained within the leached horizon, which is typically several meters thick. The dominant mineral in the bauxite horizon is gibbsite, with an average concentration of approximately 75%. The other major minerals in order of abundance include goethite, and hematite, with lesser amounts of anatase, kaolinite, quartz, rutile. Boehmite and organic carbon concentrations are very low. 1.2.5. Mineral Resource Estimation The Mineral Resource Estimate as reported by SRK for the Minim Martap, Makan and Ngaoundal tenements as at July 2025 is presented in Table 1-2 in the next page. The total estimated Mineral Resource considering the three (3) tenements amounts to about 1.1 Billion Metric Tonnes. The Mineral Resource estimates have been prepared to a sufficient quality standard and classified in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources, and Ore Reserves (JORC Code, 2012), and SRK considers that the classifications reasonably reflect the Competent Person’s confidence in the estimates. Based on the marketing studies commissioned by Camalco, and the mine planning work completed as part of the DFS, the following criteria have been used for resource reporting: a) Danielle, Beatrice, Raymonde, Agnes, and Alice, which Camalco has identified as the high-grade priority plateaus, have been reported using a ≤ 15% SiO2 cut-off grade applied to individual model cells. b) All other plateaus have been reported using ≥ 35% Al2O3 and ≤ 15% SiO2 cut-off grades applied to individual model cells.Table 1-2 - Mineral Resource Estimate for Minim Martap – July 2025 1.2.6. Mining and Mining Inventory The selected mining method for the Minim Martap Deposit considers the use of surface miners, supported by front-end loaders (FELs) and truck haulage. This method is proven, efficient, and cost-effective for bauxite extraction, with successful use in similar areas like Guinea. Run-of-mine (ROM) ore will be transported to ROM pads and then off-site via an existing rail line. Waste material will largely be backfilled into the mined-out voids to support progressive rehabilitation, with minimal initial pre-stripping required on each plateau. Using appropriate ore loss and dilution factors, the three plateaus considered for mining in the 20-year life of mine plan have an initial extractable mining inventory of 199.5 Mt (Table 1-3). Table 1-3 - Total Extractable Mining Inventory for Minim Martap Deposit The inventory beyond the Ore Reserve estimate (20-year life of mine plan-LOMP) is expected to support further extraction beyond current LOMP, upon 1st renewal of mining permit. The additional mining inventory not considered in the LOMP will include ore from the eight (8) plateaus forming a part of the Minim Martap Mineral Resource. 1.2.7. Ore Reserve Estimation The Ore Reserve estimation, conducted for the Minim Martap Deposit adheres to the guidelines set by the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources, and Ore Reserves (JORC Code, 2012). The 2025 Ore Reserve Statement for the Minim Martap bauxite deposit as reported by SRK, with an effective date of August 2025, is presented below as Table 1-4. Table 1-4 - Minim Martap Ore Reserve Statement – August 2025 The Ore Reserve Estimate is based on the 2025 Mineral Resource Estimate and incorporates several modifying factors, including: a) A required direct shipping ore (DSO) grade of 51% alumina (± 1%) and <2.0% silica (± 0.5%).b) Considerations for ore loss and dilution derived from operational practicalities.c) An economic stripping ratio informed by current cash costs and performance metrics.The previous Ore Reserve estimate for the Minim Martap bauxite deposit, with an effective date of June 2022, was also reported in accordance with the JORC Code (2012). The 2025 update reflects changes due to a new life of mine plan (LOMP) based on the revised inputs: a) Updated Mineral Resource estimate.b) Estimates for ore loss and dilution.c) DSO specifications. 1.2 Mining 1.3.1 Mining Methodology and Mining Models The selected mining method for the Minim Martap Deposit considers the use of surface miners, supported by front-end loaders (FELs) and truck haulage. This method is proven, efficient, and cost-effective for bauxite extraction, with successful use in similar areas like Guinea. Run-of-mine (ROM) ore will be transported to ROM pads and then off-site via an existing rail line. Waste material will largely be backfilled into the mined-out voids to support progressive rehabilitation, with minimal initial pre-stripping required on each plateau. Cut-off grades were applied to meet a target product specification of 51% Al₂O₃ and ≤2% SiO₂. For the Danielle and Raymonde plateaus, Al2O3 cut-offs were necessary to meet the average Al2O3 requirement. However, as these deposits are naturally low in SiO2, no further SiO2 constraints were required beyond the existing resource cut-off of 15% SiO2. In contrast, the Beatrice plateau contains high Al2O3 and did not require any Al2O3 cut-offs. However, it could not consistently meet the ≤2% SiO2 threshold without significant losses. As a result, material from Beatrice was permitted to exceed the 2% SiO2 target, provided it remained within the 2.5% low-quality SiO2 limit, with blending during production ensuring compliance with overall product specifications. The cut-off grades are summarized below in Table 1-5. Table 1-5 - Bauxite Cut-off Grades at Different Plateaus Ore loss and dilution are applied within the mining models. The Danielle and Raymonde plateaus experienced limited impact from dilution due to their elevated Al2O3 cut-off; SRK applied a 25 cm loss and dilution approach, which aligns with the operational precision of the proposed surface miners. At Beatrice, SRK adopted a 0.7 m loss-only approach to minimise the risk of reintroducing high-SiO2 material through dilution. SRK also applied the following losses to account for operational constraints: a) 0.5 m ore loss is applied at the base of the deposit where the orebody comes into direct contact with the underlying clay zone.b) 0.5 m ore loss is also applied at the top of the deposit where the ore outcrops at surface to account for the stripping of topsoil and the potential contamination of ore by organic material during initial mining activities. Considering the above, the total Extractable Mining Inventory for the Minim Martap deposit is presented in Table 1-3. 1.3.2 Pit and Waste Dump Design The Minim Martap Deposit supports a 20-year Life of Mine Plan (LOMP) based on current DSO specifications and applied modifying factors. Appropriate geotechnical and access considerations have been applied and risks relating to these are considered minimal due to the shallow nature of the ultimate pit design. External waste dumps have been provided for minimal initial pre-strip. These dumps are currently located over potential inventory outside of the 20-year life of mine and may result in some sterilization in the short term. The ultimate pit design base was left to align with the base of ore (BOO) as defined by the margin ranking exercise with no additional modification applied. There is a level of uncertainty associated with the location of this interface due to the drill spacing and potential fluctuations between the drill holes and an allowance of loss has been made within the models to account for this. This represents the largest risk to the inventory as presented in this LOMP. SRK considers the risk to the Project to be minimal as there is additional inventory available at comparable grades which can be introduced to the LOMP to supplement the feed if required. The waste material scheduled in the LOMP has an average grade of ~44% Al2O3 and 3.9% SiO2 which presents the opportunity for a lower grade product for the operation. This material has not been selectively dumped or stockpiled in this study but should be considered in future study work to ascertain its future product potential and how to effectively separate the material for future use. Waste dump locations for different plateaus are illustrated in Figure 1-3 within the accompanying Media Snippet and the Life of Mine Plan Inventory is shown in Table 1-6. Table 1-6 – Life of Mine Plan Inventory 1.3.3 Life of Mine Production Schedule The LOMP provides a schedule of tonnes and grade for ore and waste over time for use in mining cost estimation and financial modelling. The LOMP only includes Measured and Indicated material as a source of DSO material. The Minim Martap Project can support elevated grades targeting 52% Al203 for the initial 3-year start-up period, before ramping up to 10 Million Wet Metric Tonnes/Annum of product with DSO specification. The operation will commence at the Danielle Plateau to minimise the required start-up time and capital before transitioning to Beatrice and Raymonde later in the mine life to effectively manage the SiO2 in the product, which can be maintained below 2% total SiO2 for the life of the mine. The start-up period of the mine, due to low rail capacity, will require low machine utilisation from the mining fleet and therefore offer reasonable flexibility and redundancy early in the mine life. The total material hauled from the mine and used as DSO product for the purpose of reporting is summarised below in Table 1-7. Table 1-7 - Ore Summary – Hauled from Mine end as DSO Product Year-wise bauxite mined along with waste removal and the stripping ratio is presented within the accompanying Media Snippet in Figure 1-4 and bauxite production schedule from the different plateaus of the Minim Martap Deposit is presented on the next page in Table 1-8. Table 1-8 - Yearly Proposed Bauxite Production from Different Plateaus 1.4 Mine Site Infrastructure (MSI) 1.4.1 Purpose and Scope of MSI The MSI is designed to provide support for all activities and services for mining operation. Its "battery limit" starts at the entrance of mining trucks from the Pit (excluding ROM stockpiles) and ends at the gatehouse at the beginning of the road towards the IRF (Inland Rail Facility). The MSI comprises various modular, fit-for-purpose buildings and facilities, including dome shelters and transportable office modules. These include: a) Heavy and Light Vehicle Workshopsb) HV and LV Wash Down Facilityc) Tyre Change Facilityd) Fuel Storage and Distributione) Bulk Lube Storagef) Warehouse and Consumables Supplyg) Kitchenh) Crib Roomsi) Administration Area – Ablutionsj) Officesk) Campl) Water Supply and Treatmentm) Sewage Treatment Facilityn) Waste Managemento) Weighbridgep) Other facilities include a gatehouse, medical and emergency services, control room, and security room.q) Accommodation for 40 Personss) A kitchen / mess for the residentst) Laundry facilityu) A Club House with recreation buildings, sports facilities etc.v) A dedicated building for CSRw) Main Admin Buildingx) Clinic and Emergency Response Buildingy) A Mosquez) A Technical Workshop 1.5 Hauling Road The transportation logistics operation to support the mining activities consists of transportation of the bauxite from the ore stockpile at mine end to the stockpile at IRF (Inland railway facility) through trucks and from IRF to port through rail. As part of the development of the Minim Martap Bauxite project, the establishment of a functional link road between the village of Minim, the mining areas (Béatrice, Danielle and Raymonde) and the Makor station is a major strategic issue. This access road is intended to ensure the efficient transport of ore, as well as the movement of equipment and personnel. The total length of the main road is 42 km and that of the secondary branch roads is 15.81 km. The road layout envisaged is given in Figure 1-5 in the accompanying Media Snippet. The geometry of the road has been defined to allow the safe movement of heavy machinery, with a reference speed of 40 km/h. The planned platform is 9m wide, including a 7m carriageway and two 1m shoulders. Longitudinal slopes are limited to 6% with some exceptions to 8%, with minimum radii of curvature of 100 m (80 m exceptionally). The road development work for the road network connecting the Minim Martap Bauxite Deposit to the IRF are structured across six phases, including earthworks for the IRF, new road sections to the IRF, sections overlapping the RN15 National Highway, complementary segments linking Plateau Daniel to the IRF, and roads connecting the Béatrice, Raymonde plateaus with Minim village, all integrated into a unified network. Alibaba has been assigned to construct the haul road. Alibaba is also responsible for loading bauxite in Truck (Total load of truck 80T) from MSI and hauling bauxite towards IRF, maintenance of road, unloading of bauxite at IRF stockpile and loading of bauxite into rail. 1.6 Rail Minim Martap Bauxite Project is made up of 3 Explorations Permits, Minim Martap, Makan and Ngaoundal which are connected to the Douala Port through Rail Network as shown in Figure 1-6 within the accompanying Media Snippet. Minim Martap and Makan Permits are adjacent and are located around 25 km from the Ngaoundal Permit. Overall, they cover an area of 981 Sq.Km. The bauxite ore occurs as independent plateaus. A total of 79 plateaus are recorded. CAMALCO shall finance 4.5 billion CFA Francs (~US$8 million) to carry out the rehabilitation work and around 54 billion CFA Francs (~US$95 million) to build capacity in the existing railway infrastructure, through the construction of around 11 new crossing stations and the extension of existing crossing loops at 29 stations. The above referred rail infrastructure development and rehabilitation expense/ financing will be carried out by CAMALCO, which will be compensated through offsets against royalties and / or other charges (Reference No 00000001/PV/MINMIDT/SG/DM/SDAM/DM/SSEM, Dated 26th June 2025). A working group composed of Ministry of Mines, Ministry of Finances, Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Economy & Planning, CAMRAIL & CAMALCO is being set up for the above-mentioned compensation. 1.6.1 Inland railway Facility (IRF) The nearest rail head to the Minim Martap Bauxite project is the Makor railway station, with three existing lines and a relatively flat terrain which is ideal for the establishment of the IRF. The transportation of bauxite from the mining area to the IRF location will be done by road trucks. Bauxite will be unloaded onto stockpiles adjacent to the existing rail siding prior to loading into the train ore wagons. IRF shall be developed in stages to meet the requirement of scaling of export volume from 2,1 Mtpa to 10 Mtpa and further for handling Alumina. The development will proceed in following stages: 1.6.2 Railway Network The Douala-Yaoundé-Ngaoundere railway line of Camrail connects Douala port to Ngaoundere. The line between Douala-Yaoundé -Ngaoundere is split in two sections: Transcam 1(Douala – Yaoundé, 264 km) and Transcam 2 (Yaoundé – Ngaoundéré, 620 km) Transportation Plan by Camrail It includes the planning of Regional Project for the Improvement of the Performance of the Douala N'Djamena Rail/Road Corridor (PCDN) and Belabo - Ngaoundere Railway Line Renewal Project (PRBN). Purpose of the Plan a) Douala – Yaoundé b) Belabo – Ngaoundere Axle Load a) Current Current axle load of Douala – Ngaoundere section is 18 T. b) Proposed The proposed Axle load after completion of the track renewal work all along Douala –Ngaoundere is 20 T. Rail Connectivity to Port The take-off of the proposed IRF Rail siding is at Camrail CH: 796+870 km which is about 5.75 km from the Makor station. The proposed IRF line no. 1 connects Camrail at two locations i.e. CH: 796+870 km and CH: 798+823 km. The movement of Bauxite per annum will be 2.1 million tons during Complete Track Renewal (CTR) phase and 10 million tons after CTR. Train Configuration and Loop Extension The train configuration before and after CTR is given as below: a) Train Configuration Before CTR 2L+50W(570 m Train length) b) Train Configuration Before CTR 1L+50W-2L-50W-1L (1140 m Train length) Based on the data provided, most passing loops would be able to accommodate a 539 m-long train, with an exception of Yaoundé, which has a passing loop track length of 434 m. Provision has been made during CTR works for additional crossing loops and the lengthening of existing rail loops to allow for movement of the longer trains required to facilitate the increased ore transportation. The Port’s Rail infrastructure begins from the Port’s right of way near Sandaga Road level crossing, about 1.5 km away from the Bessengue railway station as shown in the Figure 1-7 given in the accompanying Media Snippet. According to the report prepared by Systra, construction of 11 new crossing loops and 29 loop extensions has been proposed for hauling operation of longer train. The port rail network consists of two marshalling yards (Rake-forming stations). Train services run from the marshalling yards to warehouses, port terminals and port operators' industrial facilities and logistics bases. Each of these services function in the same manner as a branch line terminal, and their rail traffic management is the responsibility of the stations of the respective marshalling yards, as below: a) Port Amont The Upstream Port station for the upstream part of the port. b) Port Aval The Downstream Port station for the downstream part of the port. 1.7 Port and Transshipment 1.7.1. Project Purpose and Location The project aims to establish a dedicated facility at the Port of Douala for barge loading of bauxite. For this, three locations were shortlisted and finally one location has been finalized. This preference is mainly due to its readily available waterfront towards both the North and West, existing rail tracks (Corridor 1 and Corridor 2) behind the storage space, and the potential for waterfront expansion. The site is a brownfield port facility, requiring some modification work, for bauxite transportation, and is located over 800 km away from the Minim Martap Bauxite Project. 1.7.2. Bauxite Properties and Climatic Conditions The following bauxite properties and climatic conditions have been considered at the port stockpiling facility: Physical Properties Climatic Conditions Douala experiences a tropical monsoonal climate with high humidity (99% in rainy season, 80% in dry season) and heavy rainfall from June to November. Average temperatures range from 23.33°C (August-October) to 30.56°C (March). Historical data shows average wind speeds of 6.2 km/hour in May, with maximum storm winds reaching 70 km/hour. The port has been impacted by significant storms and cyclones, such as Cyclone Eline (2000) and Cyclone Leo (2018), with Leo bringing sustained winds up to 120 mph. Tidal variation is from +0.6m (MLW) to +2.6m (MHW). 1.7.3. Site Geotechnical and Hydrographic Information Douala's earthquake hazard level is classified as low by the Think Hazard platform. The soil conditions of the selected plot are predominantly sandy formations with a clayey silt matrix, indicating an alluvial origin, where cohesion is not a governing criterion. The topography of the plot shows a mild slope from the North-East wood stockyard towards the South-West river-bank. The Wouri River at Douala Port has a very gentle slope. Recent bathymetry revealed an average channel depth of 8m for navigation, though the far side has shallower drafts (5.5m to 6.5m). Periodic dredging is required for smooth navigation. The anchorage point is located 59 km away due to the mild slope of the navigational channel. 1.7.4. Traffic Projections and Operations The project anticipates a phased increase in traffic: a) Phase 1: Starting with 1.2 mtpa (Million Tonnes Per Annum) in 2026, increasing to 2.1 mtpa in 2027 and 1.7 mtpa in 2028 and 2029.b) Phase 2: Further increasing to 6.3 mtpa in 2030, 7.0 mtpa in 2031, and reaching 10.0 mtpa in 2032. This 10 mtpa level will be checked during the Detailed Project Report (DPR) preparation. The core operations at the port facility include: a) Unloading of incoming loaded wagons. b) Stacking of unloaded cargo. c) Reclaiming from storage and barge loading for transshipment. 1.7.5. Rail Transportation and Wagon Handling Bauxite will be transported exclusively by dedicated rakes from the mine to the port. The selection of wagon type will prioritize efficient unloading at the port and bulk loading at the mine, aiming to maximize operational benefits and minimize the number of wagons, maintenance, and downtime in the overall system. Regarding wagon types, Flat Wagons and Covered Wagons are not suitable for large-scale bulk cargo transportation required for this project. For large cargo volumes, conventional discharge systems include: a) Wagon Tippler arrangements for Top-Open Wagons. b) Track Hoppers and associated tunnels for Bottom-Discharge type Wagons. However, both requires considerable space, deep excavation, major civil works (especially challenging at Douala due to high water table), and a long implementation time. Both systems involve complex mechanical arrangements and control systems. Grafix Engineering Consultant Pvt. Ltd. is conducting a detailed study to explore different options for wagon unloading, stockpiling and reclamation of DSO ore for further loading into the barges. At the initial stage wagon unloading has been planned using crawler or tyre-mounted Mobile Crane (fitted with outriggers) having grab attachment from both sides of the rail siding. Subsequent stacking and reclaiming operation shall be done using pay loaders. However to cater the enhanced production at a later stage, wagon unloading has been planned by using an electric-driven, rail-mounted travelling equipment with a traversing spiral (screw) type vertical unloading arm. Subsequent stacking and reclaiming operation shall be carried out using mechanised stacker reclaimer or travelling tripper and pay loader combination. Two existing rail corridors (Corridor 1 and Corridor 2) are available near the project site. Corridor 2 is considered best suited for the project, particularly for fully mechanised handling, and offers adequate siding length to potentially accommodate a full rake without splitting in earlier stages. However, splitting loaded rakes will become unavoidable at higher traffic volumes. 1.7.6. Storage Capacity and System Efficiency The design principle for the export facility emphasizes ensuring ships do not wait for cargo. Therefore, storage capacity will typically be at least one ship load or marginally higher, increasing with the number of ships to account for random arrivals, equipment downtime, and unforeseen rake disruptions. The conclusions in the Report prepared by Grafix Engineering Consultants Pvt. Ltd relating to the Port Studies: Planning and Design. recommend storage capacity of either 1.5 times the maximum ship size or 1/15 times the annual throughput. Various storage options are considered, with initial stockpile capacities ranging from 0.2 MT to 0.3 MT and final capacities up to 0.5 MT. Some options involve extensive payloader and dumper operations, with stockpile heights initially limited to 6m due to soil properties and practical considerations. More mechanized options involve mobile rail-mounted unloading equipment discharging onto ground conveyors for stacking with elevated mobile tripper conveyors or rail-mounted travelling stacker/reclaimers. One option which utilizes Rail Siding Corridor-2 and a Rail Mounted Travelling type Stacker/Reclaimer, is considered best suited for fully mechanised handling. Barge loader types vary from fixed radial movement loaders to those capable of travelling between multiple berths for greater economy. 1.7.7. Transhipment and Waterfront Operations The facility will handle 10,000 DWT self-propelled barges for transshipment. The target ship size at anchorage is 170,000 DWT, with a loading target of 20,000 tonnes/day using Floating Cranes (provided by others). 24-hour night navigation is possible. The anchorage area is deemed tranquil enough for year-round transshipment, with 320 safe operating days per annum considered for barge movement and ship loading. The selected plot, being at a corner of the water body, has both North and West waterfront access. The West side waterfront is initially preferred for barge loading due to an existing sheet pile front and direct access to the backup area. The existing Wood Handling Jetty on the North side may need to be dismantled to optimize waterfront utilization as traffic increases. 1.8 Environment Social and Community The Minim-Martap Bauxite Project involves Extraction of DSO Grade Bauxite from the Minim Martap Deposit, transportation of Bauxite through haul road from the mine stockyard to the Inland Railway Facility (IRF) in Makor for bauxite evacuation, and the establishment of a port terminal at the Autonomous Port of Douala (PAD) for bauxite export. This necessitates a comprehensive Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) to comply with national and international regulations. Separate ESIA studies have been conducted at Mine site, Haul Road, IRF and Port Area. 1.8.1 ESMP Budget Separate ESMP budget has been calculated for incorporation of the mitigation measures, identified for individual areas, which has been suitably considered under the cost head of respective unit operations. 1.9 Bauxite Market and Pricing Camalco commissioned CM Group to provide an independent assessment of the outlook for the global bauxite market, including a price forecast for the specific grades of bauxite to be exported from the proposed Minim Martap bauxite mine in Cameroon. This independent assessment notes the following. Forecast Priced for Minim Martap Bauxite Under Base, High and Medium Cases, 2026 to 2036 (US$/dmt real 2025, CIF China) is presented in Figure 1-8 within the accompanying Media Snippet. For the purpose of establishing a long-term benchmark base case price, a freight rate forecast of US$17/Dry Metric Tonnes (dmt). Using this freight rate assumption, the base case long-term price forecast for Minim Martap bauxite is US$78/dmt CIF Shandong. 1.10 Project Execution and Implementation Plan 1.10.1. Implementation Schedule The total estimated time-period for project implementation is estimated at 12 months for stage 1 of the project development from the "Initiation of Project Construction Activities". This schedule assumes that all related studies (Geology, Mining, MSI, Road, Rail, Port, etc.), finalization of project details, financing arrangements, statutory government clearances, and creation of a nucleus project organization are completed before construction begins. The DFS itself is tentatively scheduled for completion by August 2025. 1.10.2. Contracting Model The project will use an Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management (EPCM) model. The EPCM scope includes design, construction, and commissioning of equipment and facilities, encompassing mine infrastructure, transport logistics, road design, project-wide operations/maintenance infrastructure, and contract arrangements with rail/port authorities. The implementation strategy for various packages is based on discrete turnkey mode, where contracts have been awarded to separate agencies are awarded based on their expertise (e.g., main equipment supply, civil work, structural steelwork, utilities). This approach is chosen to balance time and cost for the project, with an optimized number of discrete turnkey packages (four identified). The four packages are: Mine Development and Operation, Hauling Road, Rail Operation, and Port Construction and Transshipment. The total operation of mining of Bauxite, stockpiling, Rail transportation, and Transshipment has been distributed under three (3) major Packages. The Packages and the selected agencies responsible for execution of the packages are mentioned in Table 1-9 as presented below. Table 1-9 : Operation Methodology 1.10.3. Exclusions from EPCM Scope Certain critical aspects remain under the Owner's (Camalco's) team, including mine pit design, mine road network design (except integration), procurement and management of mine pit equipment, performance of mining operations, acquisition of rights-of-way/permits, environmental/ social investigations, community programs, test work, land acquisition, and financial modeling. 1.10.4. Owner's Execution Team and Operational Readiness Camalco's Owner's Project Team will be onboarded gradually, including construction, engineering, HSEC, procurement, and management roles, to ensure a smooth transition to operations. 1.10.5. Participation of Authorities Successful project implementation requires significant engagement and agreement with key Cameroonian stakeholders: a) Ministry of Mines (MINMIDT) for exploitation permits and regulatory framework. b) Ministry of Environment (MINEPDED) for environmental impact assessments, guidelines, certificates, and mine closure plans. c) Ministry of Transportation for road use licenses and right-of-way discussions. d) CamRail (rail service provider) for train control, track improvements, bauxite train priority, crew management, asset management, and infrastructure validation. e) Port Authority of Douala (PAD) for access to the Wooden Terminal, dredging, right of way for conveying systems, and utility connections. 1.10.6. Engineering and Design The EPCM Contractors will manage engineering to deliver contractual requirements within budget and schedule, complying with legislative requirements and recognized codes. The scope includes providing engineering support, participating in change management, supporting construction, providing technical input for procurement, reviewing vendor drawings, and assisting with commissioning and ramp-up. Battery limits for design are clearly defined for Mining, MSI, Road, IRF, Port, and Transshipment. 1.11 Cost and Financial Analysis 1.11.1 Operating Cost Table 1-10 summarises the breakdown of cash costs. Table 1-10 - Summary of Cash Costs Figure 1-9 within the accompanying Media Snippet shows that transport and port operations constitute 82% of the all in sustaining costs (costs of production). Royalties and levies comprise 8%, while mining and waste removal only constitute 9% of all in sustaining costs. 1.11.2 Capital Expenses The development and sustaining capital of the project is detailed below. It comprises of a haul road construction from the ROM pad to IRF, mine camp for Camalco personnel and railway rolling stock. To facilitate the start of this project, Camalco has committed to providing funding for rail upgrade but will be reimbursed for these upfront funds. The Total Capital Expenditure for the Project is presented below in Table 1-11. Table 1-11 - Total Capital Expenditure 1.11.3 Sustaining Capital Sustaining capital costs are included in contractor costs. Contract mining cost and haulage cost from mine to IRF are inclusive of a capital charge and as such, no separate sustaining capital expenditure for the project owner is applied. Arise Port and Logistics, the contractor chosen for port and logistics, includes the maintenance of rolling stock. 1.11.4 Project Economics Table 1-12 presents a summary of key outcomes in the cashflow analysis of the project in real terms and Figure 1-10 within the accompanying Media Snippet shows the annual free cash flow in real terms. Table 1-12 – Summary of Key Economic Assumptions 1.11.5 Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity for the impact of changes in key assumptions, namely bauxite price, mining and other costs, transport and capital expenditure, to the project evaluation was conducted. Each assumption was independently increased and decreased by 10% and 20% to determine the impact on the project cash flow value, as detailed in, as illustrated in Figure 1-11 within the accompanying Media Snippet. From this sensitivity analysis, it is evident that the NPV is most sensitive to changes in the bauxite price followed by transport cost, but with much less sensitivity. Mining operating costs and capital expenditure have the least impact on project NPV.

APPENDIX 2 – ORE RESERVE STATEMENT SRK Consulting (Australasia) Pty Ltd (SRK) has contributed to an updated Ore Reserve estimate for the Minim Martap bauxite deposit, which is part of the Minim Martap mining project located in the Adamawa Province of central Cameroon. The update to the Ore Reserve estimate is based on an updated Mineral Resource estimate, completed by Mr Rodney Brown from SRK (Australasia) Pty Ltd dated June 2025 and a DFS (Detailed Feasibility Study Minim-Martap Bauxite Project) dated August 2025, compiled by M. N. Dastur and Company (P) Ltd and a LOMP completed by SRK (Australasia) Pty Ltd. The project is owned by Camalco SA, a wholly owned subsidiary for Canyon Resources Limited. This Ore Reserve estimate adheres to the guidelines set by the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources, and Ore Reserves (JORC Code, 2012). The 2025 Ore Reserve estimate for the Minim Martap bauxite deposit, with an effective date of August 2025, is shown in Table 1. The Ore Reserve estimate is based on the 2025 Mineral Resource estimate and incorporates several modifying factors, including: The Ore Reserve estimate considers only three plateaus within the Minim Martap concession area: Danielle, Raymonde and Beatrice. There is sufficient ore, at the required product grade, to fulfill the 20-year mine plan that supports this Ore Reserve. The previous Ore Reserve estimate for the Minim Martap bauxite deposit, with an effective date of June 2022, was also reported in accordance with the JORC Code (2012). The 2025 update reflects changes due to a new life of mine plan (LOMP) based on the revised inputs: Figure 1 within the accompanying Media Snippet provides a summary of the conversion from the 2025 Mineral Resource model to the 2025 Ore Reserve estimate. Table 1: Minim Martap Ore Reserve Statement – Effective Date 31 August 2025 Notes: APPENDIX 3 – JORC CODE 2012 TABLE 1 Section 1: Sampling techniques and data (Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections).

This announcement has been approved for release by the Canyon’s Board of Directors. Forward Looking Statements and Cautionary Statements This announcement contains “forward-looking statements” and “forward-looking information”, such as statements and forecasts which include (without limitation) financial forecasts, production targets, industry and trend projections, statements about the feasibility of the Project and its financial outcomes (including pursuant to the DFS), future strategies, results and outlook of Canyon and the opportunities available to Canyon. Often, but not always, forward-looking statements and information can be identified by the use of words such as “plans”, “expects”, “is expected”, “is expecting”, “budget”, ‘outlook”, “scheduled”, "target", “estimates”, “forecasts”, “intends”, “anticipates”, or “believes”, or variations (including negative variations) of such words and phrases, or state that certain actions, events or results “may”, “could”, “would”, “might”, or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved. Such information is based on assumptions and judgments of Canyon regarding future events and results. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements and information involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, targets, performance or achievements of Canyon to be materially different from any future results, targets, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements and information. Forward-looking statements and information are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, sensitivities, contingencies, assumptions and other important factors, many of which are beyond the control of Canyon and its directors and management. Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Key risk factors (including as associated with the DFS) are detailed (non-exhaustively) in this announcement or in Canyon's previous ASX announcements). These and other factors (such as risk factors that are currently unknown) could cause actual results, targets, performance or achievements anticipated (including in the DFS) to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements and information. Forward-looking statements and information (including Canyon’s belief that it has a reasonable basis to expect it will be able to fund the costs of the Project for its estimated life of mine) are (further to the above) based on the reasonable assumptions, estimates, analysis and opinions of Canyon made in light of its perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments, as well as other factors that Canyon believes to be relevant and reasonable in the circumstances at the date such statements are made, but which may prove to be incorrect. Although Canyon believes that the assumptions and expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements and information (including as described throughout this announcement) are reasonable, readers are cautioned that this is not exhaustive of all factors which may impact on the forward-looking statements and information. Canyon does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements or information, except in accordance with applicable securities laws. Investors should note that there is no certainty that the Project will be feasible and there can be no assurance of whether it will be developed, constructed and commence operations, whether the DFS results will be accurate, whether production targets will be achieved or whether Canyon will be able to raise funding when it is required (nor any certainty as to the form such capital raising may take, such as equity, debt, hybrid and/or other capital raising). It is also possible that such funding may only be available on terms that dilute or otherwise affect the value of Canyon’s shares. It is also possible that Canyon could pursue other ‘value realisation’ strategies such as sale, partial sale, or joint venture of the Project. Risk factors which are set out (non-exhaustively) in this announcement, or in Canyon's previous ASX announcements, highlight key factors identified by Canyon which may cause actual results to differ from the DFS or may otherwise have material detrimental impacts on Canyon and its business. Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimates are necessarily imprecise and depend on interpretations and geological assumptions, minerals prices, cost assumptions and statistical inferences (and assumptions concerning other factors, including mining, processing, metallurgical, infrastructure, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors) which may ultimately prove to be incorrect or unreliable. Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimates are regularly revised based on actual exploration or production experience or new information and could therefore be subject to change. In addition, there are risks associated with such estimates, including (among other risks) that minerals mined may be of a different grade or tonnage from those in the estimates and the ability to economically extract and process the minerals may become compromised or not eventuate. Canyon’s plans, including its mine and infrastructure plans, and timing, for the Project, are also subject to change. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that the production targets, financial forecasts or other forecasts or other forward-looking statements or information will be achieved. Investors are advised that the assumptions and inputs to the financial model may require review as project development progresses. While the Company considers all the material assumptions to be based on reasonable grounds, there is no certainty that they will prove to be correct or that the production targets or estimated outcomes indicated by the DFS (such as the financial forecasts) will be achieved. Given the various uncertainties involved, investors should not make any investment decisions based solely on the results of the DFS. Production Targets and Financial Forecasts derived from the Production Targets This announcement contains production targets for the Project, which are 100% underpinned by the Proved and Probable category Ore Reserves estimated at the Project pursuant to the JORC Code (2012). The estimated Ore Reserves underpinning the production targets have been prepared by a competent person in accordance with the JORC Code. The Inferred category Mineral Resource estimates at the Project have not been included in the Ore Reserves or production targets and have not been included when determining the forecast financial information detailed in this announcement. There is a low level of geological confidence associated with Inferred Mineral Resources and there is no certainty that further exploration work will result in the determination of Indicated Mineral Resources (or Ore Reserves) in relation to that mineralisation. The production targets for the Project and the financial forecasts disclosed in this announcement (including as derived from those production targets) are based on the material assumptions outlined in this announcement and are subject to various risk factors, such as those (non-exhaustively) outlined, or referred to, in this announcement and in previous ASX announcements. These include assumptions and risk factors about the availability of funding. While Canyon considers all the material assumptions to be based on reasonable grounds, there is no certainty that they will prove to be correct or that the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimates are accurate or that the production targets or financial forecasts as indicated in this announcement will be achieved. Non-IFRS financial measures This announcement contains certain financial measures (such as NPV and IRR) that are not recognised under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Although the Company believes these measures provide useful information about the Company's financial forecasts, they should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance or cash flow prepared in accordance with IFRS. As these measures are not based on IFRS, they do not have standardised definitions and the way the Company calculates these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Consequently, undue reliance should not be placed on these measures. Not financial product advice This announcement, and the information provided in it, does not constitute, and is not intended to constitute, financial product or investment advice, financial, legal, tax, accounting or other advice, or a recommendation to acquire any securities of Canyon. It has been prepared without taking into account the objectives, financial or tax situation or particular needs of any individual. Canyon is not licensed to provide financial product advice in respect of an investment in securities or otherwise. Past performance Any information regarding past performance included in this announcement is given for illustrative purposes only and should not be relied upon as (and is not) an indication of Canyon’s views, or that of any other party involved in its preparation, on Canyon’s future performance or condition or prospects. Not an offer This announcement is not a prospectus, product disclosure statement or other offering document under Australian law or any other law and will not be lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. This announcement is for information purposes only and is not an invitation, offer or recommendation with respect to the subscription, purchase or sale of any security in Canyon, or any other financial products or securities, in any place or jurisdiction. No liability The information contained in this announcement has been prepared in good faith by Canyon. However, no guarantee, representation or warranty expressed or implied is or will be made by any person (such as Canyon and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, associates, advisers and agents) as to the accuracy, reliability, correctness, completeness or adequacy of any statements, estimates, options, conclusions or other information contained in this announcement, except as required by law.

Title: Windows on Arm PCs can now connect to Meta Quest — Microsoft sneaks out Mixed Reality Link update

Mixed Reality Link now supports Windows on Arm, letting Snapdragon X PCs connect to Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. If you have a PC powered by a Snapdragon X processor, you can now connect it to your Meta Quest 3 or Meta Quest 3S headset. Mixed Reality Link now supports Windows on ARM PCs, giving users more flexibility when it comes to using a local Windows PC within virtual reality. It's not clear when Microsoft added support for PCs powered by Snapdragon X processors. The Mixed Reality Link listing in the Microsoft Store states that the app received an update on August 29, but there does not appear to be a change log. A Reddit post by user "Nicalay2" highlighted the new capability. Regardless of whether the feature is brand-new or rolled out previously, it's a nice addition to Mixed Reality Link. Microsoft has worked hard over the years to improve app compatibility for Windows 11 on Arm. Mixed Reality Link is an app that allows you to connect up to three virtual monitors to a supported Meta Quest headset. The app is still in preview and works with the Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S. The app allows you to connect your PCs to your headset wirelessly or through a wired connection and creates a multi-monitor setup that's only visible to you. It's also possible to access a Windows 365 Cloud PC on a Meta Quest headset. Mixed Reality Link was seemingly limited to Intel and AMD-powered PCs until recently. Microsoft's support document for the app still lacks any mention of Snapdragon X PCs, such as the Surface Pro 11. But Reddit user "Nicalay2" was able to connect a Surface Pro powered by a Snapdragon X chip to Mixed Reality Link. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. The Meta Quest 3S is a next-gen VR headset that was designed to be affordable. It features a powerful chipset, comes with next-gen controllers, and supports the best Meta Quest games and apps. One of the main draws of the Meta Quest 3S is its price. Nicholas Sutrich, who leads VR coverage over at Android Central, said "the idea of having a $299 Quest 3 headset seemed preposterous" when discussing the rumored pricing of the Meta Quest 3S. Those rumors turned out to be accurate, and the result was a "triumph", according to Sutrich. The Meta Quest 3S sets the standard for affordable VR, delivering much of the same experiences as its more expensive sibling, the Meta Quest 3. There are some tradeoffs, of course, such as the Meta Quest 3S having a narrower field of view and worse display, but Meta had to trim some features and specs to hit the $299.99 price point. I've reviewed VR headsets and covered the virtual reality space for years, dating back to the awkward days of the Gear VR. I've played the best Meta Quest games, interviewed game developers while battling in virtual reality, and am no stranger to streaming Xbox games through the cloud. The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition is a special version of the headset with unique coloring and some bundled extras. It comes with a pre-installed Elite Strap ($70 value), an Xbox controller ($65 value), and three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate ($60 value). The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition is only available for a limited time, but how long that time will be is unclear. Meta sold out of the Xbox Edition of the headset quickly but Best Buy still has stock. Considering the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition is $100 more than the normal Meta Quest 3S, you get quite a bit extra for the extra cash. Sutrich called the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition the "best value in VR," and I agree. Our Executive Editor Jez Corden went hands-on with the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition. Corden said Xbox Cloud Gaming on the Meta Quest 3S is "absolutely awesome" and broke down the partnership that made the device possible. The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition is an excellent bargain, but if you don't need an Xbox controller or want to grab a headset at a lower price, the standard Meta Quest 3S is available and is also a great option. "The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition is the best value you'll find in VR today. The Meta Quest 3S is already a value-focused VR headset, but the inclusion of a pre-installed Elite Strap (a $70 value), an Xbox controller (a $65 value), 3 months of Game Pass Ultimate (a $60 value), and 3 months of Horizon+ (a $24 value). That's $119 worth of stuff you're getting for free, plus the fact that there's no other way to get this black-and-green-themed bundle." — Nicholas Sutrich ✅Perfect for: Gamers interested in getting into VR at a more affordable price point that won't mind a little blur and a lower resolution❌Avoid if: You'd prefer paying extra for the Quest 3's sharper image quality, or want the unique design and/or extras included in the Xbox Edition 👉See at Best Buy The Meta Quest 3S is a triumph in every regard. It's an unbelievable bargain at $299, yet it still exhibits the best mixed reality and virtual reality gaming available today. The only real compromises are the lenses and display, which are worse than the Quest 3 but not detrimentally so. — Nicholas SutrichAndroid Central review ⭐⭐⭐⭐ 1/2✅Perfect for: Gamers interested in getting into VR at a more affordable price point that won't mind a little blur and a lower resolution❌Avoid if: You'd prefer paying extra for the Quest 3's sharper image quality, or want the unique design and/or extras included in the Xbox Edition👉See at: Amazon 🔎Price check: $249 at Best Buy (Payment options, no game items) 🤔Alternate deal: Amazon ($394.53, 256GB, Batman: Arkham Shadow) Sean Endicott is a tech journalist at Windows Central, specializing in Windows, Microsoft software, AI, and PCs.

Title: Whales Load Up On Ethereum, But Analysts Fear $4K Dip Ahead

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum showed fresh buying pressure this week after reports that a major Bitcoin whale dramatically increased its Ether holdings, a move market watchers say could reshape short-term flows. According to reports, one of the earliest and most influential Bitcoin whales bought roughly 820,220 ETH over the course of two weeks, a haul valued at about $3.6 billion at current prices. The purchases were logged across multiple addresses and have drawn attention because they represent a large transfer of capital into Ether rather than Bitcoin. Traders say such concentrated accumulation can lift sentiment and draw other large holders into the market. Ethereum’s latest trading performance has mirrored the big move. At the time of reporting, ETH traded around $4,390, with a 24-hour trading volume of $39 billion and a market cap near $538 billion. 🐳 THIS OG BITCOIN WHALE HAS BOUGHT 820,224 ETH WORTH $3.6 BILLION IN JUST 2 WEEKS. HE DEFINITELY KNOWS SOMETHING 👀 pic.twitter.com/iG9Su2BGZE — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) August 31, 2025 The token was up 2% over the previous day. Those raw numbers underline that demand for Ether remains high even as some parts of the market pull back. Derivatives activity tells a more mixed story. Reported data shows derivatives volume fell 14% to $61 billion, while open interest climbed 2.90% to $60 billion. The OI Weighted metric declined -0.0007%, a small drop that indicates a minimal reduction in positioning strength. According to these movements, dealers comment that the market may be consolidating: less new trades but more positions held. Mixing technicals with on-chain data, current forecasts point to moderate upside. Based on the latest prediction, Ether is expected to rise 11% and reach $4,870 by October 1, 2025. Market sentiment is listed as Bullish while the Fear & Greed Index reads 46 (Fear). Over the last 30 days, ETH logged 47% green days and an 9% price volatility reading. Those indicators suggest a market that has room to run, but which still carries meaningful uncertainty. Analysts have offered a cautionary note. According to analyst Ted, ETH’s recent outperformance versus Bitcoin may pause for a brief retest around $4,000 as liquidity clusters are swept and traders reassess exposure. He points to order-book dynamics that often trigger a pullback before new upward moves — a pattern that has played out in prior rallies. $ETH has been holding up really well compared to BTC. But there’s still a chance of $4K retest. Just take a look at huge liquidity clusters and you’ll understand. Just keep one thing in mind: I’m just short-term bearish. pic.twitter.com/D9XIrxr5zq — Ted (@TedPillows) August 31, 2025 Investors and desks say they are watching three things: the flow of large on-chain buys, whether derivatives open interest continues to rise, and whether price holds above key support near $4,000. Reports of whale accumulation have sparked talk of rising institutional interest, but the drop in spot derivatives volume shows some short-term participants stepping back to wait. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Despite a recent dip in Reliance Industries' stock after its AGM, brokerages remain optimistic, setting target prices as high as Rs 1,733.

The partnership, announced on August 29, will see RIL and Meta jointly invest ₹855 crore in a 70:30 ratio to develop Llama-based enterprise AI platforms. | Photo Credit: - Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) shares traded lower by 0.43 per cent at ₹1,351.30 on Monday morning at 11.30 am, despite announcing a joint venture with Meta to develop enterprise AI solutions for India. The stock opened at ₹1,356 and hit a day’s high of ₹1,357 before declining to ₹1,340.60. The partnership, announced on August 29, will see RIL and Meta jointly invest ₹855 crore ($100 million) in a 70:30 ratio to develop Llama-based enterprise AI platforms. The joint venture will offer AI Platform-as-a-Service and pre-configured solutions targeting Indian enterprises and SMBs, with the transaction expected to close in Q4 2025. Brokerage firms maintained positive ratings on RIL following recent AGM announcements. JPMorgan retained its Overweight rating with a target price of ₹1,695, while Kotak maintained Add with ₹1,555 target. Jefferies and HSBC kept Buy ratings at ₹1,670 and ₹1,630 respectively. Nuvama maintained Buy with the highest target of ₹1,733. According to Santosh Meena of Swastika Investmart, the stock decline reflects investor disappointment with the Jio IPO timeline being pushed to H1 2026, later than expected 2025 listing. He noted RIL’s historical pattern of post-AGM declines despite significant announcements. Key AGM highlights included the definitive Jio IPO timeline, launch of Reliance Intelligence subsidiary, and ambitious retail growth targets of 20 per cent CAGR over three years. The company reiterated plans to double EBITDA between FY2022-FY2027 and achieve ₹1 lakh crore FMCG revenue within five years. Analysts remain optimistic about RIL’s long-term prospects, citing its diversified business model and strategic investments in AI and new energy. The company’s New Energy business is expected to potentially match the scale of its O2C operations. Trading volume stood at 45.04 lakh shares worth ₹608.59 crore, with 59.48 per cent deliverable quantity indicating sustained investor interest despite the price decline.

Reliance Jio is gearing up for a potential record-breaking IPO by the first half of 2026. While analysts see it as a major value-unlocking event, concerns remain over execution risks, holding company discounts, and missed opportunities from not pursuing a demerger. Jio’s massive scale, new product launches, and strong subscriber growth continue to fuel investor interest and speculation.

Mukesh Ambani is gearing up for Jio's mega IPO — tipped as the "mother of all IPOs" – but Reliance Industries' 44 lakh shareholders may be sidelined. Unlike the Jio Financial Services spin-off, this listing won't give them direct shares. Instead, they'll benefit indirectly via RIL’s 66.3% stake, which may face a holding company discount from investors seeking direct exposure.

Title: The crash of 2026: a fiction
URL: https://crookedtimber.org/2025/08/31/the-crash-of-2026-a-fiction/
Time Published: 2025-08-31T21:39:55Z
Full Content:
by John Q on August 31, 2025 Looking at the facts, there’s no reasonable conclusion except that US democracy is done for. But rather than face facts, I’m turning to fiction. So, here’s a story about the collapse of Trumpism, crony capitalism and the AI/crypto bubble. Fiction is a relatively unfamilar mode of writing for me, so critique (on style and structure rather than plausibility) is most welcome. The crash of 2026 began with a literal crash. A Tesla robotaxi operating on an open highway for the first time, inexplicably swerved into the path of oncoming traffic. Coming in the other direction was a Cybertruck whose driver, relying on self-driving capabilities, was busy checking his investments on the phone. His instant death spared him from the knowledge of his impending bankruptcy. Tragically, a school bus was following, and its brakes failed (the school district later blamed budget cuts for inadequate maintenance) The driver did her best to steer around the wreckage but the bus overturned and burst into flames. By the time the smoke cleared, there were six deaths, including the busdriver and two children, as well as the occupants of both Teslas. More then 30 schoolchildren were taken to hospital. The images of death and disaster ran on TV and social media for weeks. The reaction was swift. By the end of the day, Tesla’s robotaxis had been taken off the road throughout the US, and demands for retribution were everywhere. Several Tesla dealerships were torched and others closed down. The situation wasn’t helped by a bizarre tweet from Elon Musk, appearing to suggest that the bus driver was a “crisis actor”. By the time Wall Street opened the next day, the financial analysts had done their sums. The legal liability for the disaster would run into billions, enough to wipe out most of Tesla’s cash reserves. And with the robotaxi business gone, there was nothing to conceal the truth of Tesla’s situation: a company with declining sales and margins trading at more than 100 times its current earnings. With the prospect of massive short sales at the opening bell, trading in Tesla shares was suspended. This was bad news for Musk, who faced margin calls and the loss of his holdings in X and SpaceX, both secured by his ownership of 16 per cent of Tesla. But as usual in such cases, he got off easily. Musk turned up soon afterwards on a Caribbean island he had bought through a shell company years previously, along with the government of the nation that supposedly ruled it. No longer the richest man in the world, and theoretically bankrupt, he nonetheless enjoyed the comforts of a mansion and a super-yacht, each with its fleet of servants. The situation was rather different for the owners of the other 84 per cent of Tesla, who collectively faced the loss of nearly a trillion dollars. Those with diversified holdings and no debt took the loss philosophically, as an offset against the massive profits of recent years. But others, who had borrowed to buy both Tesla and crypto assets like Bitcoin, faced disaster, especially when rumors spread that Tesla was about to dump its own massive Bitcoin holding. The price of Bitcoin fell 25 per cent overnight. Longstanding HODLers were not concerned, reminding themselves that Bitcoin had fallen many times before, and had always rebounded. But now that crypto-currencies were embedded into the financial system, there were plenty of players with a shorter-term perspective. They started talking to economists, who almost universally agreed that crypto-currencies were inherently worthless. Traders who had gone all in on crypto suddenly saw the merits of profit taking. Regulators, who had been quiet since the passage of the GENIUS Act, started asking questions. The real disaster came with the exposure of large-scale fraud at Tether, the most prominent of the stablecoins, which were supposed to trade at exactly $1 US. As the volume of investors seeking to quit crypto increased, it emerged that the supposedly ironclad asset backing of Tether had been undermined by a complex web of derivative transactions, allegedly the doing of a “rogue trader”. Once Tether “broke the buck” the run was on in earnest. Wall Street banks found that that they had significant direct exposure to crypto and even more through their counterparties. They went into lockdown, calling in whatever debts they could. The realisation that the multi-trillion dollar valuations of Tesla and Bitcoin had been spun out of thin air led to a harder look at Wall Street’s “Magnificent Seven” now reduced to six. Claims that AI was about to generate massive wealth if only more billions were invested looked silly. Investment in data centers stopped abruptly. Nvidia was the first casualty. Once orders for chips from the hyperscalers dried up, its business was over. The advertising businesses of Google and Meta, and the Amazon retail business, went next. There would be no growth in sales of consumer goods for some time to come. Microsoft and Apple, with real businesses and products, fared better, but their values, based on hyperbolic price-earnings ratios, fell drastically. Crowds of ruined investors, milling in the streets, became violent, and were suppressed by heavily armed and masked thugs, presumed to be ICE, with several deaths. Increasingly violent protests and even more violent suppression followed. At this point, a global financial crisis similar to that of 2008 was now inevitable. There were loud calls for an internationally co-ordinated response. But such co-ordination, already inadequate in 2008, was non-existent this time. Fed Chair Kevin Hassett, appointed by Trump after the removal of Jerome Powell, couldn’t even get his global counterparts to pick up the phone. With less direct exposure to the crisis, other countries sought to protect themselves, imposing exchange controls, and preventing repatriation of funds to the US. Crypto trading was banned in many jurisdictions, and holders of crypto were required to report their positions to regulators. Taken collectively, these disasters threatened to wipe out the entire wealth of the Trump family. Naturally, Trump struck back, announcing the discovery that trillions of dollars in US foreign debt was fraudulent, and would be expropriated. The remaining US public debt, following the plans previously announced by Stephen Miran (chair of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers) would be forcibly converted into 100 year bonds, at rates to be set by the US. The EU and Canada reacted by freezing US-owned assets. Trading on major stock exchanges around the world was suspended. At this point, global capitalism seemed doomed, along with democracy. But somehow things turned around. With their donors facing ruin, dozens of Republican Representatives and Senators switched sides, throwing control of Congress to the Democrats, who immediately announced impeachment proceedings against Trump. Trump called on JD Vance to expel the traitors from the Senate, but, sensing the ground shifting, Vance temporised. Trump attempted to declare martial law, but was forestalled by Vance and the Cabinet, who invoked the 25th Amendment to remove him. At Trump’s urging, a MAGA mob, including dozens of the masked gunmen now ubiquitous on American streets, marched on the Capitol, planning a repeat of 2020. But this time they were met by the army, with fixed bayonets and machine-gun emplacements. After a brief exchange of fire, the crowd fled, leaving dozens of dead and wounded behind. The Vance Administration lasted only a few days. After seeking assurances that he would not face prosecution, Vance resigned in favor of Jerome Powell, who had been hastily appointed as Vice-President and was seen as the technocrat most likely to restore faith in the US, The fallout was rapid. Facing impeachment and likely criminal charges of corruption, Supreme Court justices Thomas and Alito resigned, while Gorsuch and Kavanaugh decided that their appointments had been improper all along. The five remaining members of the court unanimously overturned the previous finding of Trump’s presidential immunity, and discovered that participation in the January 6 insurrection was in fact treasonous. Facing this catastrophic defeat, MAGA fragmented. A minority of Trump’s supporters genuinely repented of the disaster they had brought on their country and became zealous defenders of democracy. Another group pointed to the feeble statements they had made criticising Trump and tried, with varying degrees of success, to maintain a role in public life. Some of the MAGA base gave up on politics altogether, suddenly discovering that Trump was just as corrupt as the Democrats he had railed against. Others remained loyal to their fallen leader. Republican state governments collapsed as the party fragmented. Trump’s trial proceeded rapidly this time, and he was sentenced to spend his remaining days in prison, along with many of his cronies. There were some scattered insurrections which were rapidly put down, with their participants held in the various detention centres conveniently created by Trump. Now, in early 2028, the world economy is gradually climbing out of the pit created by the crisis. The financial sector, a shadow of its former self, remains largely nationalised, and the disastrous losses in the crypto sector have yet to be resolved. But AI technologies, now in the public domain after the collapse of the hyperscalars. have started deliver significant (though not stratospheric) productivity benefits. Continued declines in the cost of solar power and battery storage have dispelled concerns about shortages of electricity, and have supported new investments in rewiring the economy in the US and other countries. The reconstruction of the US political system will take much longer. President Powell, virtually assured of re-election, has proposed a constitutional convention that would replace the failed two-party system. The first step, already implemented in most states, has been a shift to instant runoff voting in Congressional elections, along with the scrapping of the primary system. But a shift to full-scale proportional representation is expected, with the former Republican party splintering, and socialists gaining significant support in cities and even some rural areas. There is, as Adam Smith observed, a great deal of ruin in a nation. It will take decades for Americans to repair all the damage done by their experiment with fascism. But America has huge resources, both human and natural, and (at least in this fictional account) the traditions of democracy are finally reasserting themselves. { 45 comments… read them below or add one } Alex SL 08.31.25 at 10:55 pm That is a very nice narrative, and it is obvious that a large financial crash is coming. If it is frightening enough to Republicans, it may well end Trump’s administration. Unfortunately, it is otherwise all too optimistic. Among the fundamental constants of the last few decades that have got the USA into this mess are: First, there are never any consequences for powerful and rich people. The only way to see consequences for a powerful and rich person is if they first lose their wealth; that is why Sam Bankman-Fried, Elizabeth Holmes, and Bernie Madoff ended up in prison but Adam Neumann, Elon Musk, and Donald Trump never did, because the former lost their wealth, and the latter did not. God forbid that a billionaire or, for that matter, a former president ever sees repercussions like the little people for breaking laws or doing a war crime. No matter how bad an economic crash, the people who caused it will not feel any consequences. This culture of shielding the powerful and rich at all costs also means that no, the supreme court justices will not resign. That idea is unthinkable to them, as it is to the vast majority of Americans. There is no solution to this problem except a deep cultural change where the American public at large sees billionaires, elected officials, and judges as deserving more accountability than a weed dealer or a shoplifter, because, as the comic book hero goes, with great power comes great responsibility. And I don’t see that happening overnight. Second, MAGA is a cult, and it is not going away even if Trump dies tomorrow or is removed from office next year. They will be back in 2028 or 2030 or 2032 or 2032, and their mission will still be to abolish democracy, to destroy science, to remove minorities from any position of status and responsibility, and to conduct ethnic cleansing. There is no solution to this problem except to purge the Republican party of MAGA, and to make the entire right-wing media ecosystem illegal, and to completely overhaul the US education system, including making home schooling illegal. None of that is going to happen in my lifetime. So, within a few years the goldfish-like memories of the voters will just bring MAGA back under a different name and with a different leader. Third, the Democrats are utterly useless. Even if brought back into power (and it would have to be them, as president Powell is much less likely than president Vance putting Powell back into the Fed to restore faith), they will not implement the reforms outlined in the second-to-last paragraph. They are in their happy place fund-raising and handing that money over to consultants who tell them to go further to the right and seek bipartisan solutions on ethnic cleansing oh sorry immigration. There is no solution to this problem except to purge the Democratic party of centrists, and given the realities of primaries, the byzantine campaign donation systems, and the hilariously undemocratic intra-party governance of the USA, that isn’t ever going to happen. I would love for a better outcome, but realistically, the choice is between (1) fascism and (2) a few years of hapless centrists not solving any of the structural issues that lead to fascism, followed by fascism. Cheryl Rofer 08.31.25 at 11:19 pm This is very good. Thank you, John! John Hamilton Farr 08.31.25 at 11:59 pm Damn that’s good… John Q 09.01.25 at 12:14 am @Alex You’ll notice that all the leading figures except Trump (along with unnamed cronies) get off scot-free. It’s fiction, not fantasy. Seekonk 09.01.25 at 12:29 am Brilliant! Rich 09.01.25 at 1:14 am Too optimistic! Where is the dystopia? Where are the zombies? John Q 09.01.25 at 2:14 am Rich @6 There’s not much point in fiction about a dystopia when you’re already in one. And there’s loads of financial zombies, not to mention Zombie Economics Cheez Whiz 09.01.25 at 3:46 am Well thought out and well done, Mr. Quiggan. I raised an eyebrow over the collapse of crypto, but its likely once money guys get scared enough to look. I raised the other eyebrow at the popping of the AI bubble, but again, a good scare might do it. But when the Republicans went along with Vance giving up the White House, I was out of eyebrows. Republicans willingly surrendering Trump is entirely believeable in this scenario, but giving up power by giving up Vance? This is not our Republican party. The screams from Fox and the Freedom Caucus would deafen the world, and this would be the moment Vance and Theil have been planning for years. Vance might be forced out by a Democratic party that grew a continental-sized spine, but it would be a bloody fight. Dan Strong 09.01.25 at 6:44 am I’m with Alex SL on this one – I enjoyed the story, but it did strike me as hopelessly rosy-eyed. It’s hard to swallow the suggestion that there are, in fact, limits to what the Republican party would tolerate from Trump. Not to mention the idea that the sclerotic Democratics would be able or willing to effectively exploit a political crisis of the right. John Q 09.01.25 at 8:18 am Dan @9 Did you read the opening para of the post ? Mike Huben 09.01.25 at 12:49 pm The most improbable thing (to me) is the resignation of the Supreme Court justices. If anything, resigning would make them even more vulnerable. Not to mention that the right-wing corruption would continue to bribe them, now to stay in office. Dave 09.01.25 at 1:37 pm I believe this will all happen exactly as described, but over a few decades instead of years. nastywoman 09.01.25 at 2:18 pm SOOO BEAUTIFUL!!!! – and we play with most of it already on our game of WOR(L)D DOMINATION with the UTMOST BEAUTIFUL ADDITIONAL SINK of NEW YORK and CALIFORNIA going FULL SOCIALIST (in any Americans Mind) and doing completely their OWN FUN SINK (as Elon would) say – why Elon is currently -actually far, faaar too involved in his WAR against the UK and Germany that he put the US kind of on PAUSE. YES SIR!!! Harry 09.01.25 at 2:41 pm “Second, MAGA is a cult, and it is not going away even if Trump dies tomorrow or is removed from office next year. They will be back in 2028 or 2030 or 2032 or 2032, and their mission will still be to abolish democracy, to destroy science, to remove minorities from any position of status and responsibility, and to conduct ethnic cleansing” It is a cult, but it is a personality cult. Once Trump is out of the way it will fragment, as personality cults often do. This may not be as optimistic as it sounds — there are a lot of very people in the cult who are unstable, angry, and armed. And maybe someone can pull together another personality cult composed of some of the fragments, plus other dangerous forces. I can’t think who, but then in 2014 I had no idea a Trump could. Gwyneth Paltrow? Jerry Brown 09.01.25 at 4:07 pm It has the elements of a story. There are an awful lot of villains and at least some of them get their just rewards. The protagonists need some development. Maybe some more work developing Powell as a reluctant hero. And you have to change the names of course. And sex sells so you want some in there somehow with this bunch. Maybe think George Clooney as the Powell character on the verge of being fired for some Trumped up charge on the eve of the traffic accident. And he gets saved by some unlikely heroine somewhere in the judicial system. Maybe like a fictional Amy Coney Barret type who sees through the Trumped up charges and decides to act in the interest of justice for a change. Stranger things have happened. Laban 09.01.25 at 4:50 pm “a repeat of 2020” You mean a guy in a buffalo head dress being escorted through the Capitol by officers ? I seem to remember far worse unpleasantness in the name of George Floyd, which people seemed quite pleased about. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/trump-flees-to-bunker-as-protests-over-george-floyd-rage-outside-white-house I think the dollar is unlikely to still be the reserve currency by 2100, unless by some miracle the United States can be re-industrialised. I think that’s what he’s trying to do, however imperfectly, but he only has 3.5 years and a nation divided in many ways who have watched living standards fall for decades . China has a high-IQ, hardworking* population which is far less multicultural, and living standards and morale are on the up. It’s not that I’ll welcome our new Chinese overlords. Anyone working in the tourist industry will tell you Americans are much more generous. the point of the Chinese Exclusion Act was basically – “these guys work too hard for too little”. Michael Cain 09.01.25 at 5:57 pm I wouldn’t be so sure that the regular military would respond quickly to a President Vance’s order — based on a 25th Amendment takeover — to deploy and fire on American civilians. Trump has been replacing a lot of high-level officers based on what looks like a loyalty requirement. It seems possible that we would instead get a demonstration of “This is why the Founders didn’t want a standing army.” JimV 09.01.25 at 6:30 pm What I’ve heard recently about MAGA (and believed) is that about 37% of the people in the USA (and maybe elsewhere but with different focuses) are mean sociopaths or worse who enjoy Trump exactly for all the evil things he does, and are going to be with us always, some of them billionaires. So even if things do get better, they will get worse again, and the story, which I enjoyed, has some fantasy in it. (I enjoy good fantasy.) Robert J Berger 09.01.25 at 8:14 pm Loved it, wish it comes true. (the later part with Trump and his Minions in Jail and the country comes to its senses, hopefully we can avoid total economic destruction) Cheez Whiz 09.01.25 at 10:55 pm But those soldiers were chosen for loyalty to Trump personally. With Trump out of the picture where do their sympathies land? Questions like this abound throughout the (optimistic) scenario here, and is why the honest reality-adjacent answer is “nobody knows”. There’s a list of authoritarian personality cults to compare, with a range of outcomes (as I read somewhere) from The People’s Temple to Scientology. Can Vance be David Miscavige? Man has devoted himself to presenting as an empty suit, so who knows. J-D 09.02.25 at 12:15 am Alex SL’s reaction on finding John Quiggin’s story implausible is to make suggestions which are much less plausible. Alex SL 09.02.25 at 12:30 am Harry, These people existed before a Trump candidacy was a twinkle in anybody’s eye. For many decades now, they became school board members to push for creationism, they have worked towards filling the judiciary with Federalist Society hacks, they have carefully built a vast radicalisation machine ranging from local radio across Fox News to Youtube influencers, they have effectively infinity bribe money for elections at their disposal and an entire network of think tanks to influence elected officials, all with the aim of transforming the USA into a white-dominated plutocracy with the civil rights of, at best, the late 19th century. (I think they would not re-introduce racial chattel slavery… probably… but many of the libertarians among them would likely be okay with indentured servitude, as they think that any contract is ethical and acceptable if it is entered into without literally having a gun held to one’s head; they don’t count “if you don’t do this, you will starve to death” as coercion, and the only freedom they care about is that of the wealthy to do as they please with their wealth.) Do you think these people will go away or conclude that they are now in favour of liberal democracy, a welfare state, scientific expertise, and gay marriage once Trump is gone? This authoritarian movement didn’t start with Trump. It merely coalesced around him. It has completely taken over the Republican party. It will stay, and it will come back electorally even if they lose the next two elections, which would in turn depend on ICE not standing guard in front of most polling places to, ahem, “maintain order”. It would take a generational effort to discredit this movement, and there is no sign that any significant, organised counter-movement exists to undertake that effort. Chetan Murthy 09.02.25 at 2:11 am Oof. John, I thought I was pessimistic. Capital controls, expropriation, oof. Not saying you’re wrong. I moved my 401k entirely out of US investment and into European ones. But they’re still housed in a US brokerage, so haha, subject to expropriation and capital controls. Sigh. Goddamn FATCA and FBAR. Chetan Murthy 09.02.25 at 2:24 am Dan @ 9: I would answer differently from John Q. I also -fear- that there are no “limits to what the Republican party would tolerate from Trump”. None at all. In that case, this ends in one of two other ways: civil war in America America collapses and the rest of the world walls it off and goes its own way B/c they’re speed-running the destruction of the systems that keep America working. When those systems fall apart, either the G(r)OPers turn (John Q’s scenario), or there’s civil war, or America descends into some sort of hell. I say this to my European, Asian, and elsewhere friends: plan on a world without America. Plan on it. Hell, plan on a world in which America is your enemy. I’ve lived in America since I was four years old. I’m the sort of American who hasn’t left the country since 2007 (work trip). I spent 3yr in France on a postdoc. Besides that and a few trips for work, I’ve never left the country. I’m -that- sort of American: stay-at-home. A week ago, I booked travel to France to start re-learning French and look around for a place to emigrate to. Maybe it won’t be France. But it’s coming. I regret not having done it in early 2025; it’s time to do it now. We’re falling apart. Maybe not the way John Q describes it, but we -are- falling apart. [As Dan says] Our elites are either complicit or feckless cowards. That’s no way to run a country. Prepare yourselves, prepare your countries. Talk to your elected officials. nonrenormalizable 09.02.25 at 5:16 am Plausible or not, in about 6 months time this post will be the source material which various LLMs will draw upon to inform users that two Teslas had a serious crash resulting in the deaths and hospitalisation of several schoolchildren, and that Tether will have broken the buck. David Eisenberg 09.02.25 at 9:22 am In terms of style, it works really well. It reminds me of one of the “future history” stories I ever read: The Great Nebraska Sea. Laban 09.02.25 at 9:39 am Chetan Murthy 24 Rural France is pretty neat, as long as you don’t expect too much. A very liberal friend lives in a village where le Pen is by far the most popular politician. OTOH, France have perfected lawfare against dangerous parties, as have the UK. Le Pen is banned from standing in 2027, and the SNP found legal problems at the height of their electoral appeal. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Branchform Harry 09.02.25 at 12:38 pm Alex — not sure what I said to provoke that comment really. Yes, it coalesced around Trump. But its a minority of R voters; the primary system and his cult of personality coalesced it. Most R elected officials at the national level will revert to supporting business interests as soon as they dare (a lot of them genuinely fear for their lives, and those of their families). If Vance or someone else can do what Trump has done MAGA will remain very powerful. And maybe they can. I just don’t see who it is. And yes, the Dems seem hopeless, there’s very little opposition. As of now it looks entirely possible that the Trumpists are going to induce the Dems into the error of choosing Gary Numan.. sorry, Gavin Newsom as their candidate. Not saying it isn’t grim, of course it it. But coalitions are coalitions, and this one seems to have required a particular person to bring it together, and that person can’t last long. Remember too that the leading figures in MAGA are a bunch of scumbags who are genuinely driven by personal ambition more than anything, and that’s not a recipe for long term stability. Jacob 09.02.25 at 2:13 pm If US democracy persists, will you decrease your estimate of how good you are at analysing and predicting politics as a result? Mike Furlan 09.02.25 at 2:37 pm (a lot of them genuinely fear for their lives, and those of their families). Rather, I think, an even worse fear, that differing with Trump will hurt their careers. And not just R politicians, the country is run by careerists who are easily manipulated or intimidated by Trump. (Put me in Tim “Apple’s” place, for one example, and I’m not sure I would behave any better. I’m not blaming.) Another explanation is Adrian Tchaikowsky‘s in “Bear Head” that some people are like parasitic insects that invade and exploit ant colonies in a way that the ants have no defense. Chetan Murthy 09.02.25 at 3:49 pm Laban @ 27: I am not yet a refugee. But the way I understand it, “once a refugee, always a refugee”. [esp. since I’m 60] I don’t think I’ll be resting easy wherever I land. It’s just a safe[r] place with the rule of law (for now) and if things start to hot up, I’ll move on. As a famous philosopher once said, “it is what it is”. BigHank53 09.02.25 at 5:38 pm Nvidia would be fine; they make perfectly good products in demand from people who need to do computationally intensive modeling: animators, meteorologists, anyone using CAD. The ridiculous pricing set by crypto miners and AI investors would stop, and they’d have to return to a profile like AMD’s. DOP 09.02.25 at 6:32 pm Alex SL: You wrote: “There is no solution to this problem except to purge the Republican party of MAGA, and to make the entire right-wing media ecosystem illegal, and to completely overhaul the US education system, including making home schooling illegal” So why does homeschooling need to be illegal? Do you have kids? I was never an advocate until I realized we needed that option (virtual public charter for us but full HS for some). You might be falsely associating homeschooling with conservative christians or christian nationalists and while that certainly is often the case, there is a sizable portion of secular non religious families that choose home school or public virtual charters for their own reasons (academic advancement, special needs, etc.). So maybe rethink that? John Q 09.02.25 at 7:08 pm Jacob @29 “If US democracy persists, will you decrease your estimate of how good you are at analysing and predicting politics as a result?” If US democracy persists because of events similar to those I’ve described, an economic crash followed by a Republican split-up, I’ll be looking prophetic. If the Dems win the 2026 midterms, Trump serves out his second term without much more damage to democracy, and Vance is defeated in 2028, not so much. But the loss of my self-esteem as an analyst and predictor would be a small price to pay. And, if neither of these happens, and Trumpist rule continues, I can comfort myself that I am old and on the other side of the planet. IM Merc 09.02.25 at 7:11 pm It’s hard to imagine a description of a financial collapse in 2026 that doesn’t mention the collapse of OpenAI. It’s the center of the AI industry, much bigger than Anthropic, and it might not even make it to 2026. It is due to get a payment from SoftBank this year, but that requires it to shift to a for-profit model from a non-profit (that confusingly owns a for-profit subsidiary), and it has abandoned its plans to do that, because it’s too difficult. If it doesn’t get that $40B payment, it might not even survive 2025. This one company is inflating the AI bubble, and it is poised to burst, which would cause 1/3 of the entire US economy to pop. Yet, in your story the AI bubble seems to deflate slowly, and only after Tesla collapses and cryptocurrencies collapse. You even have Microsoft and Google failing but for reasons unrelated to the AI bubble bursting, which seems implausible. The AI bubble bursting is going to be the focus of the coming economic collapse, not a footnote. I absolutely believe that Tesla is poised to fail. Look at its P/E ratio compared to a normal car company like Toyota and you see how ridiculously overvalued it is. It’s a matter of time before investors admit it’s actually just a car company and not one of the most innovative tech companies. Crypto will probably also collapse, but Ponzi schemes are difficult to predict, and people might push money into Crypto thinking that when the normal economy is collapsing it’s a safe haven. People are dumb like that. Also, Musk being theoretically bankrupt is a fun thing to imagine. But, he’s a centi-billionaire with political and defense-industry connections, those guys don’t go bankrupt, at least not quickly. Cabinet officials would deem his companies too big to fail, and the government would step in to save them, with DoD officials providing cover because of SpaceX. It’s fun to pretend that the Republicans might find a spine and remove Trump from office, but that’s never going to happen. What’s much more likely is that the stress of the collapse of the economy would cause a 79 year old president in poor health to have a heart attack or stroke and die. With their figurehead gone, MAGA and the whole GOP would fragment. The Silicon Valley VCs would have nothing in common with the religious zealots. Trump has made sure there’s nobody to challenge him, which means there’s nobody who could succeed him. nastywoman 09.02.25 at 7:14 pm but on the other hand Trump just posted on Truth Social: ‘In the Transcendental Logic, there is a section (titled The Refutation of Idealism that is intended to free Kant’s doctrine from any vestiges of subjective idealism, which would either doubt or deny the existence of external objects. Kant’s distinction between the appearance and the thing-in-itself is not intended to imply that nothing knowable exists apart from consciousness, as with subjective idealism. Rather, it declares that knowledge is limited to phenomena as objects of a sensible intuition. In the Fourth Paralogism (“… A Paralogism is a logical fallacy”), Kant further certifies his philosophy as separate from that of subjective idealism by defining his position as a transcendental idealism in accord with empirical realism, a form of direct realism!!!’ nastywoman 09.02.25 at 7:37 pm on the other hand Governor Newsom’s Press Office posted on Labor Day: HAPPY LABOR DAY TO ALL, INCLUDING THE SCUM THAT IS TRYING TO DESTROY OUR COUNTRY WITH A SICK WARPED RADICAL MIND, KILLING SMALL BUSINESSES WITH CRAZY TARIFFS, TAKING HEALTH CARE FROM CHILDREN, PARDONING J6 THUGS, SENDING THE “PRIVATE ARMY” TO ARREST GRANDMA, WRECKING OUR BEAUTIFUL ENVIRONMENT, DEFUNDING OUR SCHOOLS, AND DESTABILIZING LONG-STANDING INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS. HOPEFULLY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT, AND OTHER GOOD AND COMPASSIONATE JUDGES THROUGHOUT THE LAND, WILL SAVE US FROM THE DECISIONS OF THE MONSTERS WHO WANT OUR COUNTRY TO GO TO HELL. BUT FEAR NOT, WE HAVE MADE GREAT PROGRESS IN RECENT WEEKS, AND AMERICA WILL SOON BE SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN! AGAIN, HAPPY LABOR DAY, AND GOD BLESS AMERICA! — GCN So perhaps OUR GREAT NEW LEADER NEWSOME will finally take over and FF VON CLOWNSTICK AND ALL OF HIS NONSENSE WILL FINALLY BE FORGOTTEN? Chetan Murthy 09.02.25 at 11:06 pm DOP @ 33: I’ll give a stab at explaining why homeschooling is …. bad for democracy. First, I’ll note that I’m pretty much a poster child for the absolute bollocks value of public schooling. I spent 6th grade-graduation in Texas public schools. It’s fair to say I didn’t learn much. I learnt so little, I decided the fall of my junior year to graduate early; meanwhile I was working 1-2 fulltime jobs in fast food at night/weekends, sleeping in class all day (when else would I get my sleep — I was up until 2-4am every night working in a Jack-in-the-Box). And yet I had excellent grades. Public school was a waste of time. But OTOH, how else are we to ensure that all children mix with other children — other children who aren’t like them — and learn the basics of our history and our governance? If you leave it to these Christofascist parents, you’ll end up with an army of little Liberty University freshmen-wannabees. As bad as public school in my hometown was, my last year there the little Fascist parents were taking their kids out to send ’em to the Maranatha school. B/c public school was insufficiently -Christian-. My mind boggled even back then. I do take your point that for some children, public school is inadequate: as I described above, I was one of those children (and I neglected to mention that it was a racist hellhole that scarred me for life, that engendered so much hatred in my soul that I’d happy drop a Tsar Bomba on that damn town), but the problem is, you can’t make public policy based on exceptions: you need to make that policy so that you produce the highest percentage of solid citizens possible. I would also argue that when we find public school to be inadequate, it’s almost always the case that more funding would improve the situation. Though of course, in cases like Texas, nothing can be done: just fence it off and cede the land to Mexico: maybe if we give ’em a big payment, they’ll agree to take it off our hands. J Monz 09.02.25 at 11:39 pm Very nicely done. I have no quibbles with the plausibility, because although I may not expect the specific scenario you describe, I am quite certain that the actual events of the next few years will be even stranger and less believable than those you describe. Alex SL 09.03.25 at 12:01 am Harry, Sorry if I misread you, but given your comment at 28, I think we have a very different read on the situation. Maybe the authoritarian, anti-science, eliminatory racists are a minority among conservative voters in absolute terms, but they appear to be the most politically active and the most reliable primary voters. I just don’t see how they will stop primarying moderate “I just want to lower taxes on business” style Republicans in favour of loons just because Trump is gone. The few moderates who are left are in fear not because of the single person Trump but because of those primary voters, influencers, and activists, and they don’t evaporate after Trump. I worry that a lot of the current optimism about the USA is equivalent to a joke I saw in Germany when I was young: a father telling his children at bed time, “in 1933, Nazis came out of nowhere and took over our country, and then in 1945 they all disappeared again”. That is not how it works, unfortunately. The last sentence you wrote is the most convincing argument, I must admit: these people aren’t loyal or competent, so they may yet collapse from in-fighting. Still, even just looking across what people report from MAGA, conservative, and Republican Reddit forums and other social media, the reaction of most voters in that space to recent months can be comfortably classified into two categories: (1) Obviously I would never vote Democrats, because they want to destroy our country, but I am a bit concerned about the Tariffs. Can you fellow cult members explain to me why I should not worry? (2) Dear glorious leader, I fully support everything you do, but now your Medicare cuts are affecting me personally and/or ICE have arrested my (Hispanic) wife, and I am hopeful that now that you have read this misspelled post on a random subreddit, you/DOGE/ICE will make an exception for my family, specifically, while continuing to hurt millions of others, as they should be. Neither of these suggest that Republican voters will ever stop hitting themselves in the face with a frying pan. The first group are caught in a cult where voting anything but Republican is completely unthinkable no matter what Republicans do. The second group is too self-centered, sociopathic, and narcisissistic to be reasoned with. It is frightening to understand that there are millions of people who want to, e.g., make abortion illegal, no exceptions even in case of risk to the life of the mother, because everybody who needs an abortion is a (insert slur here) and needs to be punished, and then expect an exception to be made for themselves, because their situation is totally different, of course; but understand we must, because they vote, and they will vote even when Trump is gone. DOP, I grew up in Germany, and home schooling is illegal there, and I have never seen any problems with that. I understand that it is different if school-age children live in very remote, rural areas where there is no critical mass to run a school, but there are solutions for that in the digital age. I find it extremely unhealthy for society and the children to isolate one’s children from other children, be it for religious, racist, or classist reasons (and would outlaw all private and sectarian schools for the same reason if I could). I also simply do not believe that parents are qualified to teach unless they are certified teachers themselves, and even then they would likely only be qualified in two or three subjects. This means that home-schooling is by definition a minor form of child abuse through educational neglect. If a decent education is available, that is; I am not saying that a medieval peasant had any other choice but to home-school, what with no professional school system being accessible to them. Similarly, if schools fail the students, that is a problem. But the problem is to a great degree caused by allowing wealthy people to remove their children from the public school system, thereby removing any incentive from wealthy people to support sufficient funding for the public school system. ZDL 09.03.25 at 2:07 am Because of course the entire rest of the world just waited on America to fix everything. ???? Even when mourning your nation’s and culture’s demises you can’t help but feel exceptional. J-D 09.03.25 at 2:14 am I understand that it is different if school-age children live in very remote, rural areas where there is no critical mass to run a school, but there are solutions for that in the digital age. Although the digital age has made more possible, there were solutions long before: All the little children, Scattered through the Outback, Tune into School of the Air at the start https://flyingdoctor4education.org.au/school-of-the-air-song/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_the_Air John Q 09.03.25 at 4:02 am David @28 Thanks for the link to the Great Nebraska Sea. I really enjoyed it, especially the bit at the end about the political survival of the anished states IM Merc @35 I’ve often expressed the view that the US is one big grift. The order of the dominoes in this story is a matter of narrative arc (I think that’s the correct term) not a ranking of the grifters in order of importance. ZDL @41 You do know I’m Australian, right? I even mentioned this @34. Or are your views so US-centric (in a negative sense) that you can’t imagine an outsider having opinions on the subject ? To everyone: can we call a halt to the thread derail of home-schooling nonrenormalizable 09.03.25 at 9:29 am AlexSL @22 and @40: I am very often as pessimistic as you (and JohnQ) about the prospects of democracy in the US, and agree about how the authoritarian/illiberal tendency in American politics has existed long before Trump and will continue long after him. The lone shred of doubt that I have regarding the inevitability of this disastrous future is the essential … stupidity and singularity of Trump’s ascent to power. In almost every election cycle that he is not directly on the ballot, he and his supporters have either lost or failed to capitalize on their position. He seems to attract groups of uninformed and otherwise unengaged voters, at times running ahead of his own party in down-ballot races. As a politician, he also seems exceedingly shameless, proudly ignorant, determined to engage in minor squabbles, and desperate for attention and adulation. This, his personal history, and other attributes have made him catnip for the press in the social media age. While there are other figures who seem to enjoy dominating our conscious hours (such as Elon Musk), no one has quite the same pathological skill of generating stories (ranging from incredibly stupid and petty to those with enormous geopolitical consequences) for the world to consume. If a foreign enemy were to design from scratch a Manchurian candidate to destroy the US from within, they could not have come up with someone with a temperament so unsuited for the office of president while being so irresistible to those covering Washington. So if he were to vanish from the political stage before say, the next midterms, there would both be no draw for the class of voters I described above, and a break of the spell binding the news media. And maybe a good segment of the American public could then push back against any attempts to disrupt a fair electoral process. The MAGA/Project 2025/Federalist society/ICE people will still be around, but without a Trump figure creating endless distractions for them, perhaps the full scope of their work will become much more salient and unpopular in the public mind. They are to some extent a fractured group with different end goals, and could easily splinter when there is no leader around who is (a) somewhat popular with the electorate and (b) is amenable to their views or can be manipulated into implementing them. The danger is that the US has become hooked on the style of Trump — that he has indelibly shaped the office of the president and broadened the political economy so that people accept (and even demand) the same policies and type of leaders afterward. To some extent, this is what happened during the Biden years: the lack of daily disruptions, rambling tweets, and unceasing palace intrigue may have detracted from the sense of Biden as being in charge (on top of his own age and health issues). So perhaps we should expect a succession of mad Caesars in the years to come. Laban 09.03.25 at 10:27 am Please, nothing more like this.

Title: NVIDIA & Magnificent 7: Too Hot To Handle?

ByBill Stone, Contributor. As the dominant supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) chips, NVIDIA (NVDA) has become the largest company in the world and within the S&P 500 index. Following NVIDIA’s earnings last week, it’s an appropriate time to revisit the attractiveness of large technology stocks with a special emphasis on NVIDIA. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), collectively account for nearly 34% of the S&P 500’s market capitalization. Eight of the ten largest companies in the S&P 500 are technology companies, including Broadcom (AVGO). Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) are the only non-technology companies in the top ten. Investors already appreciate the strong fundamentals of the Magnificent 7, and NVIDIA in particular, with stock returns far outstripping those of the S&P 500. The Magnificent 7 and NVIDIA have achieved total returns of 280% and 1,093%, respectively, since the start of the ChatGPT era at the end of 2022, while the S&P 500 has returned 75%. Based on the past twelve months of earnings and consensus earnings estimates for the next twelve months, the price-to-earnings ratios for all the Magnificent 7 stocks are above the S&P 500. While this ratio indicates that most of these companies have a higher valuation on both measures, it doesn’t answer whether other factors justify that premium. Another way to value companies is by their multiple revenues, which is called the price-to-sales ratio. All the Magnificent 7 are valued at price-to-sales ratios above the S&P 500, with NVIDIA at an almost twenty-seven times price-to-sales ratio. Historical annualized growth in sales over the last three and five years has been impressive for most of the group, but downright amazing for NVIDIA. Likewise, historical earnings per share growth has generally been impressive and exceptional, as seen in cases like NVIDIA. The five-year annualized earnings per share growth rate of the Magnificent 7 demonstrates just how unique these companies have been when compared to the stock market as a whole. Future earnings are the most crucial criterion when considering whether to buy or hold a stock. Consensus forecasts from Wall Street analysts still evidence significant optimism about NVIDIA’s earnings growth prospects, with 39% annualized growth expected from the world’s largest company. Separately, the sustainable growth rate for the group supports the future growth story. The sustainable growth rate theoretically indicates how fast a company can grow without borrowing additional funds while maintaining its existing capital structure. The profitability metrics of most of the Magnificent 7 are impressive. Gross margins represent the profitability after all direct expenses, specifically the cost of goods sold, have been deducted from sales. Operating margins measure how much a company earns on a dollar of sales after paying for the variable expenses, or the percentage of sales converted into operating income. NVIDIA converted almost seventy cents of every sales dollar into operating profit over the last year. While NVIDIA’s gross margin was about 70% over the previous year, it improved to 75% in the most recent quarter. Just looking at a simple high price-to-earnings ratio can be deceiving when analyzing a company with high returns on invested capital (ROIC). It is crucial to consider the return generated on the capital needed to fund a business, since a company with a sustainably higher ROIC should sell at a valuation premium. To put some of the impressive return on invested capital figures for the Magnificent 7 into proper perspective, the ROIC for the S&P 500 is around 8%. Furthermore, most companies in the Magnificent 7 generate substantial amounts of free cash flow, despite investing in growing businesses. The free cash flow margin indicates the percentage of revenue that the company can utilize or distribute to shareholders as free cash flow. NVIDIA is exceptional, with almost forty-four cents of every dollar in sales converted to free cash flow. The free cash flow yield refers to the free cash flow per share generated by a business, expressed as a percentage of its stock price. Value investors, such as Warren Buffett, value a company based on the cash that can be distributed from a business over its lifetime, discounted back to the present. Free cash flow can be a good measure of the money available to owners. A free cash flow yield below that of the S&P 500, such as the Magnificent 7 and NVIDIA, can be seen as investors already pricing in superior growth and durability of free cash flow relative to the market. NVIDIA is particularly notable given the massive increase in its market capitalization, which now exceeds $4.2 trillion, driven by the artificial intelligence spending wave. The consumer introduction of ChatGPT as an artificial intelligence tool in late 2022 coincided with a sharp rise in NVIDIA’s valuation, as the company became the dominant supplier of AI semiconductors. There has been some concern about NVIDIA’s relatively meager beat of consensus earnings estimates last week and less exceptional guidance than has been typical. There were zero sales to China in the quarter due to geopolitical tensions, which made for more challenging comparisons. For example, data center sales, which were impacted by China, declined by 1% quarter-over-quarter, but were up about 12% quarter-over-quarter excluding China, according to TD Cowen. Despite NVIDIA’s less optimistic forward guidance than was hoped, a resumption in sales to China could add $2 to $5 billion in sales. In the short term, NVIDIA’s dominance in high-end artificial intelligence computing appears untouchable, as its next-generation platform is on pace for meaningful production next year. Furthermore, the company continues to benefit from AI demand outstripping supply, alleviating concerns about potential pricing pressures. It appears likely that AI will be a transformative tool for businesses and households, generating substantial economic benefits. Although it is still early, indications suggest that artificial intelligence adoption is continuing at a brisk pace. The capital spending (capex) by AI-leaders, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, to support complex computations needed to support AI, has seen a massive rise since 2023. NVIDIA reaped significant revenue from this spending as the leading chip provider for AI. Estimates are that capital spending by these four AI leaders will exceed $400 billion by 2026. What if demand for AI services doesn’t meet expectations or the firms are unable to monetize the services at a profitable enough level? Capital expenditures (capex) budgets can indeed be slashed if needed. This downside risk isn’t a forecast, but it must be considered when evaluating NVIDIA and all AI-connected technology stocks. Notably, these sizable capital expenditures are more sustainable than some past instances, because the companies are highly profitable and can self-fund rather than depending on the charity of lenders or additional capital. Though it is nowhere in sight, one must always be wary of some competing technology eventually displacing NVIDIA as a dominant leader. Capitalism subjects companies to intense competition in their pursuit of profits, and the profits generated by technology leaders make them an attractive target. The bullish case for large tech and NVIDIA is bolstered by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). The mega-cap technology stocks, represented by the Magnificent 7, continue to produce earnings and free cash flow at impressive rates. Large technology stocks typically exhibit exceptional profitability compared to the average stock and should therefore trade at a premium valuation. The rise in the stock prices of the Magnificent 7, including NVIDIA, has been supported by robust fundamentals and not just a promise of future profitability. Investors buy or hold companies for their future profits, not their past performance. The past is only significant to the extent that it informs the firm’s future prospects. While one needs to remain mindful of risk, the robust adoption rate of artificial intelligence, combined with companies’ ability to self-fund the massive costs required to build AI infrastructure, implies that the end is not yet here. Investors should be mindful of the risk associated with concentrated holdings, given the remarkable growth of some of these technology leaders.

31 August 2025 Time taken to read : 11 Minute KATHMANDU: Economic Digest offers a concise yet comprehensive overview of significant business happenings in Nepal, presented in easily digestible summaries. The recent developments in Nepal reflect a mix of economic, infrastructural, and regulatory shifts, impacting various sectors. The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) has rebounded with a 23-point gain, signaling improved market sentiment after a period of significant losses. Meanwhile, discussions around opening the electricity trading market to private players are gaining momentum, with the aim of enhancing competition and market expansion. However, monsoon disruptions have heavily affected the country’s transportation infrastructure, blocking nine major highways and complicating travel. On the regulatory front, the Nepal Rastra Bank has tightened guidelines for banks’ Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) spending to ensure more transparent and targeted use of funds. The government is also making strides to exit the FATF grey list by presenting progress on anti-money laundering measures. At the same time, sugarcane farmers have threatened a national highway blockade over unmet demands, highlighting ongoing socio-economic issues. Additionally, Nepal’s increasing reliance on remittances, record gold prices, and developments in agricultural exports to China underscore the country’s economic dynamics. Lastly, while the life insurance sector shows strong growth, the government faces challenges in ensuring consumer protection and addressing infrastructural funding shortfalls in provinces like Karnali. NEPSE rebounds: Index gains 23 points as market sentiment improves The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) gained 23.03 points last week, ending a recent downturn that saw a loss of over Rs 378 billion. The index opened at 2,757.97 on Sunday and closed at 2,781 on Thursday, reaching a high of 2,824.85 and a low of 2,730.74. Ten out of the 13 market sectors saw gains, with the ‘Others’ sector rising by 4.57%. Bikash Hydropower saw a surge of 60.98%, while Narayani Development Bank dropped by 44.46%. Total turnover increased by 8.38% to Rs 32.26 billion, and market capitalization grew to Rs 4.647 trillion, leading to Rs 39 billion in investor gains. Nepal explores private sector entry into electricity trading to boost competition Following a report from the government task force, discussions have begun regarding the opening of Nepal’s electricity trading market to private sector participation. Currently dominated by Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), the proposal suggests that private companies could enhance competition and expand the market. If implemented, provisions under the Electricity Act 2049 would allow private producers to sell power domestically and internationally, potentially through platforms like NepEx or direct market channels. Experts believe that private sector involvement could fast-track development and improve consumer access to affordable, high-quality electricity. Heavy rain disrupts nine major highways across Nepal Heavy rainfall has led to landslides and flooding, blocking nine key highways in Nepal, the Nepal Police reported. The affected roads include the Koshi Highway at Bhotkhola (Sankhuwasabha), the Nepal-China bridge in Rasuwa, Pasang Lhamu Highway (Rasuwa), and Arniko Highway (Sindhupalchowk). Other impacted routes are the Kaligandaki Corridor (Baglung), Beni-Darbang road (Myagdi), Jajarkot road (Rukum Paschim), Bheri Corridor (Dolpa), and Gokuleshwor-Darchula road (Darchula). Some roads, such as parts of the Mid-Hill, Prithivi, and Kaligandaki corridors, remain open for one-way traffic. Authorities continue to monitor the ongoing situation as monsoon-related disruptions affect travel across the nation. NRB tightens rules on bank CSR funds: Transparent, targeted spending now mandatory Nepal Rastra Bank has introduced new regulations to ensure that corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds are used transparently and effectively by banks and financial institutions. Banks must allocate a fixed percentage of their net profit to CSR, with at least 60% spent within the fiscal year. Institutions are required to prepare annual action plans and submit semi-annual reports detailing their CSR activities. The funds can be used to support education, health, environmental protection, financial literacy, and skill development for targeted communities. Nepal advances plan to exit FATF grey list, showcases progress in Tokyo Nepal has officially begun steps to exit the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list after being included in February due to insufficient progress in combating money laundering and terrorism financing. At the Asia-Pacific Group (APG) plenary session in Tokyo, Nepal presented updates on its quarterly action plan. The Nepali delegation, led by PM Office Secretary Phanindra Gautam and Nepal Rastra Bank Deputy Governor Dr. Neelam Dhungana Timilsina, highlighted legal reforms, improved monitoring of high-risk sectors, and new coordination mechanisms. The government remains committed to implementing reforms to secure removal from the grey list. Sugarcane farmers threaten indefinite highway blockade from September 10 Sugarcane farmers from across Nepal, who have been protesting in the capital since August 24 over subsidies and government support, have warned of an indefinite blockade along the national highway in Hariwan, Sarlahi, beginning September 10 if their demands remain unmet. Protest coordinator Shyam Babu Ray emphasized that farmers had endured harsh conditions during the sit-in, yet their calls for help had been ignored. The protest, organized by the Sugarcane Producers Federation of Nepal, opposes subsidy cuts and seeks representation in price determination. Nepalis abroad send Rs 4.72 billion daily, driving record remittance inflows Nepali migrant workers sent a record Rs 1.72 trillion home in the last fiscal year, averaging Rs 4.72 billion daily, according to Nepal Rastra Bank. This represents a 19% year-on-year increase and nearly matches the government’s annual budget. The rise in remittances is attributed to increased outmigration, stronger foreign currencies like the US dollar, and a shift from informal to formal transfer channels. While remittances help uplift households, Nepal remains heavily dependent on foreign earnings due to a sluggish domestic economy and low investment levels. Nepal social media listing standoff: Companies resist due to content control rules Nepal’s Communication Minister Prithvi Subba Gurung has criticized social media giants like Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft for refusing to register under the country’s 2080 BS social media directive. Although these companies are registered for tax purposes, they resist the government’s listing due to concerns over strict content control rules. The directive mandates the removal of content within 24 hours of complaints, which has raised fears of excessive government intervention. The Asia Internet Coalition has highlighted the challenges in enforcing fair content review, and the government has issued a seven-day ultimatum for compliance. Life insurers collect Rs 3.27B in first premiums, Shrawan 2082/83 Nepal’s life insurance sector showed strong performance in Shrawan 2082/83, with companies collectively collecting over Rs 3.27 billion in first premiums. Nepal Life Insurance led the way with Rs 103 crore, followed by National Life (Rs 42.37 crore) and Citizen Life (Rs 25.01 crore). Other top performers included Himalayan Life, SuryaJyoti Life, LIC Nepal, and IME Life, reflecting strong investor interest and sector growth. Gold smashes Rs 200,000 mark in Nepal as prices soar Gold prices soared last week, crossing the Rs 200,000 per tola threshold for the first time, driven by global market trends. Prices rose by Rs 3,100, fluctuating between Rs 197,200 and Rs 200,600 per tola. The surge was driven by US interest rate cuts, a weaker Indian rupee, and increased gold purchases by China, India, and Turkey. Analysts see gold as a safe haven asset amidst market volatility. Silver prices also rose slightly, reaching Rs 2,360 per tola. Nepal seeks Chinese flexibility to boost agricultural exports Nepal has urged China to adopt flexible customs policies to ease exports of buffalo meat, dairy products, vegetables, fruits, and herbs. During a bilateral meeting in Kathmandu, Agriculture Minister Ramnath Adhikari and Chinese Customs Deputy Minister Wang Lingjun discussed the proposal. Nepal is seeking to export thermally processed buffalo meat, ghee, butter, silage, and animal feed, and has asked for concessions on citrus fruit standards. China has acknowledged Nepal’s priority status and agreed to establish a joint trade facilitation mechanism. Currently, 34 Nepali companies export agricultural products to China. IBN approves license draft for 669 MW Lower Arun Hydropower project Investment Board Nepal (IBN) has approved the draft license for the 669 MW Lower Arun Hydropower Project at its 66th meeting, chaired by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. The board also endorsed a draft for direct investment in the Arun-3 Hydropower Project in Sankhuwasabha and authorized the issuance of a survey license for the proposed ‘Auto Service Eco-Industrial Park’ project. The decision is seen as a step toward boosting Nepal’s energy sector. Karnali’s bridge projects face funding shortfall, pushed to multi-year plan The Karnali provincial government has allocated Rs 105 million for seven motorable bridges in Rukum West, but the funds are insufficient. Officials have proposed including the projects in a multi-year plan to secure additional funding. The Infrastructure Development Office in Chaurjahari submitted the proposal to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Urban Development, warning that the bridges might remain incomplete without timely approval. The lack of bridges in key areas is disrupting local travel, schooling, and livelihoods, especially during the monsoon. KMC fines distillery after fly found in sealed Mustang Gold bottle Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) has fined Dhanusha Distillery Pvt. Ltd. Rs 200,000 after a fly was found in a sealed bottle of its Mustang Gold alcoholic beverage. The fine follows a consumer complaint and an inspection by KMC’s Agriculture and Livestock Department. The department confirmed the presence of the inedible object after lab tests. KMC also inspected several other establishments, destroying inedible oil found in four restaurants and one sweet shop.

Title: Reframing Jensen’s Law: ‘Buy more, make more’ and AI factory economics

UPDATED 15:59 EDT / AUGUST 30 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante We believe the industry’s broad interpretation of Jensen’s Law — “Jensen’s Law accelerates Moore’s Law” — understates a fundamental economic reality of artificial intelligence factories. Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s own language and Nvidia’s operating model point to a financial law of motion for AI factories: When power is the binding constraint and demand is elastic, performance per watt increases raise monetizable throughput faster than they raise total cost. The result is an extension to existing laws of tech that we’ve come to know. Specifically, Huang’s invoking of Buy more to make more (that is, revenue up) and buy more to save more (unit cost down) has explicit economic implications that we believe need further examination. In addition, there is a corollary in this new regime in that, under certain conditions, fabric‑driven utilization unlocks are so valuable that high‑speed networking becomes “economically free” (where utilization gains exceed amortized fabric cost). In this Breaking Analysis, we explain in detail what we’re referring to as a new Jensen’s Law. We’ll explore why this phenomenon is so important, review the math behind it, share some concrete examples of where the law is applicable, when the corollary of “the network is free” holds, implications for investors and operators — and where the law is not applicable. Note on scope and conditions. Our interpretation of Jensen’s law applies primarily to power-limited AI factories operating at high utilization on communication-heavy training and long-context inference workloads, with elastic demand and operator-retained margins. Outside these conditions (for example, capex-limited or demand-limited sites or batchable inference, or where vendor rents are constrained by poor operating leverage), the relationship weakens or can even invert. In this research note, we refer to our interpretation of Jensen’s Law, Jensen’s law, the new Jensen’s law or true Jensen’s law and use them interchangeably. As we move beyond single-shot prompts, reasoning and agentic AI multiplies compute per task (100X-1,000X according to Nvidia and other sources). We hear all the time that data centers are increasingly power‑constrained. Nvidia’s GB300/NVLink 72/Spectrum‑X stack explicitly targets tokens per watt as the metric to optimize along with improving achieved utilization. The assumption is, together, these variables directly allow AI customers to monetize power‑limited factories. Remember, our interpretation of Jensen’s law assumes a new dollar of spend is worth it only if the lifetime extra revenue from better efficiency and utilization is bigger than the lifetime extra costs, after accounting for risk. With that as context, let’s look at some of the supporting statements from Nvidia’s Q2 FY2026 call on Aug. 27. The core of Jensen’s Law is that performance per watt drives revenue. In a power-limited data center, the number of tokens you can produce in a year is directly tied to how efficient you are. Or as Huang (pictured above) put it: “Performance per watt drives directly to revenues… the more you buy, the more you grow.” On the latest earnings call, Nvidia cited massive efficiency gains — 10 to 50 times more energy efficiency with GB300 versus Hopper, depending on configuration and the use of FP4 precision and NVLink 72. Nvidia gave no indications of workloads, configurations or levels of accuracy, which we’ll continue to research. Nonetheless, we heard concrete return-on-investment proof points. Nvidia cited an example where $3 million spend on GB200 infrastructure generated $30 million in token revenue. That’s a 10X return, presumably not a model, but actual operating data from the likes of Microsoft Corp. and OpenAI (not cited specifically). And networking is playing a much bigger role. Nvidia’s stack itself spans all three dimensions: NVLink for scale-up inside the rack, Spectrum-X Ethernet and InfiniBand for scale-out across clusters, and Spectrum-XGS for scale-across multisite AI factories. By lifting network utilization from about 65% toward 85% to 90%, the company argues that “networking is effectively free” because the throughput gain more than covers the fabric cost. Our interpretation here is networking can be economically free in communication-heavy environments where utilization gains are greater than fabric cost. Put in context with spending, Nvidia claims the “Big 4” hyperscalers (big three of Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, plus Meta Platforms Inc.) are on pace to spend about $600 billion this year on data centers, a figure we peg lower, at just north of $400 billion – nonetheless, still huge. Perhaps Nvidia is sizing the entire data center buildout spend, which still exceeds our estimates. Nvidia sizes the remaining decade’s AI infrastructure build at $3 trillion to $4 trillion, which also are significantly higher than our market projections — but still huge and this is the capex flywheel Jensen is pointing to. Perhaps Jensen has better visibility on demand than we do. The common usage in the press (for example, IEEE Spectrum, the WSJ, Tom’s Hardware and others) positions “Jensen’s Law” as Nvidia’s acceleration beyond Moore’s Law — shorter cycles and outsized generation‑over‑generation gains. That’s directionally spot on, but we want to put a finer point on the law. In our view, the missing lever is one of economics. Our premise today is there’s a version of Jensen’s Law that is more than just marketing and it relates to the economics of AI Factories. Let’s review the core principle that’s emerging in the economics of AI factories. In a power-limited environment, every incremental dollar of spend that improves performance per watt and fabric efficiency drives monetizable throughput — tokens per second — faster than it raises total cost. That dynamic leads to two outcomes: Further, when utilization gains at the fabric level are significant, high-speed networking becomes economically free. The throughput lift outweighs the amortized cost of the networking gear. This of course is dependent on the existing utilization assumptions, the workload and the potential gains in utilization. This framing ties directly back to some of the classic laws of technology economics as shown on the right-hand side of the graphic above. What’s new is that these principles are being operationalized specifically for power-limited AI factories, and we’re anchoring them with explicit revenue math, which we’ll share shortly. That’s the shift — moving from abstract laws of progress to concrete, financial drivers of the AI economy. It might be helpful to review these classical laws, and we’ll tie them into our new interpretation of Jensen’s Law. The following is a brief summary of the laws shown above and the role they play in the new Jensen’s Law as we’ve described: Moore’s Law: speaks to device scaling and feeds the performance/watt gains – that is, the more tokens you can produce per year at a fixed power envelope the better the economics. Wright’s Law: cost declines by a constant as cumulative volume doubles – this explains the cost/token falling a deployments scale – core to the “save more” side of the equation. Metcalfe’s Law: value grows exponentially as a function of connectivity. This speaks to the network utilization – scale up, scale out, scale across, making networking economically “free.” Jevons’ Paradox: efficiency increases consumption and supports the flywheel effects of Jensen’s Law as we’ve defined it. Let’s break down the math behind our interpretation of this new Jensen’s Law. We can boil it down to three things: how many tokens you can generate, how much revenue those tokens produce, and what each token costs to make. Start with throughput — tokens per year. That’s a function of four variables: the power budget, the amount of operating time in a year, the efficiency of the system — meaning tokens per unit of energy — and how well you can utilize the cluster. Put those together, and the formula is as follows: [Tokens per year = power X efficiency X utilization.] Once you know throughput, revenue is just a matter of multiplying tokens by dollars per token. That gives you the top line. [Revenue = tokens X dollars per token.] Now let’s look at the cost side of the equation. Cost per token is your total annualized expense — servers, racks, networking, cooling, electricity, staff, real estate — divided by tokens per year. In other words, take capex plus energy plus other operating expenses and spread it across your token output. [Cost per token = capex (annualized) + energy costs + other opex​/annual token output.] Finally, gross margin. That’s one minus cost per token over price per token. Put simply, the more efficient you are at generating tokens and keeping the system utilized, the more your margin expands. [1-cost per token/price per token.] So when we say performance per watt times utilization equals revenue, this is the math. It’s not just a marketing slogan when the conditions are right, rather it’s a financial model for AI factories. Here’s a simplified graphic that lays this out more clearly: Jensen’s economic argument for networking goes something like this: If you buy more on a faster fabric, better cooling, or smarter software and it improves efficiency or utilization enough, then the extra revenue from more tokens will outweigh the extra cost of that upgrade. If efficiency and utilization gains are greater than the added costs…buy more, make more applies, because cost per token also falls… leading to buy more, save more. When efficiency cuts unit cost, you can charge less per token. If demand is elastic (customers want more when it’s cheaper), revenue grows even faster — reinforcing the Jensen flywheel as we discussed earlier. Let’s put this in a picture and look at the value flow of Jensen’s Law – “Follow the Money.” To do so,we’ll put our version of Jensen’s Law in plain language. Think of an AI factory like a cafeteria. The cafeteria has ovens (GPUs), cooks (software) and a delivery system (networking). The point is to serve as many meals (tokens) as possible every day, while keeping costs low and making money. Here’s the flow shown in the chart above: So the new Jensen’s Law is: Buy more to upgrade the cafeteria, and you’ll either serve more meals (make more) or serve each meal cheaper (save more). If both happen, your profit gets a double whammy. Networking fits right in. Better networking is like upgrading the cafeteria’s conveyor belts so every oven stays busy. Even if conveyor belts cost extra, they pay for themselves because the cafeteria serves way more meals. That’s why Nvidia says the “network is free.” The loop on the right is the accretive-spend rule. It means: So the test is: Does the revenue uplift from higher efficiency/utilization outweigh the added cost of the upgrade? The key is you have to take a systems view, which is something that Jensen always stresses – “we’re don’t just build chips, we build systems.” This is a key part of Nvidia’s moat, which is underappreciated in our view. If one part of the system is optimized (for example, more ovens create more meals) but the conveyor belt is not fast enough then the system is out of balance and revenue is not maximized. Nvidia’s Q2 results included some proof points for our interpretation of Jensen’s Law. The company gave several examples showing how new architectures and fabrics translate directly into revenue multiples and lower costs per token. Below is our take on some of those. First, reasoning and agentic AI: Unlike simple chatbots, these agents plan, use tools and iterate. That makes workloads 100 to 1,000 times more compute-intensive, which means efficiency and utilization gains matter a lot more. A key question to ask here is how is Nvidia accounting for utilization? For example, how does the calculation account for multi-tenant overheads, queueing efficiency, I/O fragmentation and restarts? Second, GB300 with NVLink 72: At rack scale, it delivers about 10X the tokens per watt compared to Hopper. With four-bit floating point math, energy efficiency improves up to 50X per token. CoreWeave Inc. says it’s already seeing 10X better inference on reasoning models in production. We’d be interested in details around what tokenization standards are most productive? What Quality of Service limits (if any) were in place to achieve these 10X to 50X claims? Third, the fabric story: Networking isn’t a side note, it’s fundamental to the economics. Spectrum-X Ethernet is already running at a $10 billion rate, and NVLink 72 gives you 14X the bandwidth of PCIe Gen5. That’s why Jensen says the network is effectively free — because if utilization gains outweigh the cost – it is economically free. We’d like to understand this further in terms of what reasonable incremental revenue over the fabric costs would constitute “free.” In other words, what kind of save NPV:Fabric TCO ratio should operators assume to achieve that economic freedom? Is it 1X? 2X? 3X – what is a reasonable cushion to guarantee results? Fourth, the $3 million to $30 million example. Jensen cited a real case where a $3 million spend on infrastructure produced $30 million in token revenue. That’s the “buy more, make more” flywheel in action. Key questions we have include: What was the time window in which this benefit was achieved – i.e. is this a snapshot benefit or one that is sustainable over a period of time? What were the price/token assumptions? What’s a reasonable range of benefit (we assume 10X is a best case scenario for marketing purposes)? And finally, cadence. Nvidia is shipping new architectures every year — Blackwell to Rubin and beyond. Each one drives higher performance per watt, higher utilization and higher revenue. It’s compounding economics. A key issue we see here is if a new Nvidia generation hits before I realize my payback (for example, I hit delays which is a clear risk) and the value of my infrastructure tanks I’m left with a failed business case and will get fired. We see this as especially pressing as AI moves from hyperscale/cloud to enterprise and edge. Bottom line: Nvidia isn’t just selling chips; it’s proving the economic engine of our version of Jensen’s Law. Heavier workloads drive the value of efficiency improvements higher, fabrics keep the graphics processing units busy, and each architecture turn compounds the “buy more, make more” cycle. But operators and enterprise customers must cut through the marketing hype, understand their unique environment and how Nvidia’s impressive claims translate into value for them. We were somewhat surprised by investor reaction to Nvidia’s latest earnings print. Other than a hit to free cash flow margin, we thought the quarter was quite remarkable. And Nvidia addressed the free cash flow in comments about its days sales outstanding, which to us was of no concern. From an investor perspective, Jensen’s Law changes four things in our view as bulleted above and described in more detail below. First, the unit of competition is no longer the chip, it’s the AI factory. What matters is system-level performance per watt and utilization, which rewards rack-scale designs, integrated fabrics, software and cadence. Second, networking isn’t overhead, it can be a profit lever. Utilization gains are so significant that fabric routinely pays for itself — often multiple times over. The caveat is the conditions have to be right. They are today for the large hyperscalers. Will this translate to mainstream enterprises to the same degree? Third, pricing power is being redefined by elasticity. If elasticity exists, as cost per token collapses, providers can still grow revenue by lowering prices, because demand expands even faster. Note: Operators must take the risk that elasticity is greater than 1 (that is, as price drops customers will buy enough to grow revenue). We’re seeing some positive signs in the scramble for capacity and the shift to reasoning workloads – indicating an insatiable appetite for AI services. The caveat here is price per token is ever-changing and very quickly. Often it’s a race to zero between API pricing, free tiers, price cuts, advertising subsidies and the like. The operator’s margin will be affected by these dynamics, which can alter the outcome. And fourth, cadence is a cash machine. Nvidia’s product cadence isn’t just about faster chips, it’s about turning capital spending into a recurring monetization flywheel. Each year, new architectures deliver higher efficiency (more tokens per watt) and better utilization (keeping clusters busier). That combination means every dollar of capex spent on GPUs, networking, and racks generates more revenue in the following cycle. But a key consideration for investors is the degree to which customers can move at the speed of Nvidia. Clearly the hyperscalers and Meta, X.ai, the neoclouds and some service providers can keep up. But mainstream enterprises will struggle to maintain pace. If and when the capex gusher dries up, enterprises and new uses cases like robotics will be the growth engine. The dynamics in these markets will be different. Nonetheless, in today’s hyperscale-led market this is what Jensen means when he says: “the more you buy, the more you grow.” Customers that continually reinvest ride the curve of annual improvements, effectively compounding returns with each generation. We believe this flywheel is in place until the end of this decade at least. Here’s how we think operators should measure Jensen’s Law in the field. First, tokens per joule — true efficiency is rising fast, 10 to 50 times in some cases. Second, utilization — some operators claim clusters run 15% to 25% more efficiently with NVLink 72 and Spectrum-X. Third, power allocation — when the megawatt cap can be flat, every gain in performance per watt drops straight to revenue. Fourth, token price and demand — as price falls, demand rises, and so does revenue (Jevons’ Paradox) Fifth, payback time — some builds now recover in under a year. And finally, fabric mix — NVLink 72 domains are scaling, and XGS (data center to data center) is just starting to emerge. We believe the AI factory math is compelling, but only under strict operating conditions. Jensen’s new Law isn’t guaranteed. There are risks and conditions where it may not hold. First, if a data center isn’t power-limited, then performance per watt isn’t as tightly tied to revenue. Second, if token prices fall faster than efficiency and utilization rise, growth stalls — especially if demand isn’t elastic. Third, workloads matter. If the model isn’t sensitive to fabric speed or collective operations, the return on fabric spend moderates. Fourth, practical constraints like supply chain delays, power or cooling bottlenecks can push out the payoff. Fifth, If alternative stacks or application-specific integrated circuits start to match Nvidia’ end-to-end efficiency, then the economics begin to normalize. The following specific details should be monitored over time in our view: Efficiency claims of 10X to 50X must be validated end-to-end, taking into consideration tokens per joule at accuracy and latency parity. This should be measured at the system level, not on a single GPU. Further, business cases should assume headroom with returns of 3X to 5X over cost to account for the risks. Utilization uplift is equally nuanced. Gains of 15 to 25 points from NVLink 72 and Spectrum-X are real for collective-heavy training and long-context inference, but may be negligible on parallel inference. Operators should expect meaningful sustained improvement over many weeks under production load before scaling. Remember, performance per watt only translates to revenue if power is the binding constraint. If capacity is capped by capex or demand, the linkage weakens. In our opinion, upgrades should proceed only when power will be a constraint for 12 to 24 months. Have high confidence that incremental throughput will be consumed – or ideally is presold. Elasticity assumptions must be grounded. Revenue uplift from price cuts applies only where elasticity is greater than 1. Otherwise, protect margins with tiered QoS. Similarly, sub-year paybacks depend on high utilization, stable token pricing and on-time installations. Our research indicates many investments face unforeseen delays. Assume higher internal rate of return/hurdle rates and longer payback periods in business cases. Operators must retain margin uplifts. In our view, upgrades are accretive only when power is constrained, utilization lifts are proven, demand is elastic, and the surplus accrues to the operator —not only to the infrastructure supplier. Finally, this interpretation of Jensen’s Law works well for hyperscalers and consumer Internet companies. It’s unclear how well it translates to enterprise AI and edge customers. We’ll dig into that as those markets evolve. These are the stress points we need to watch. Hopefully our reframe of Jensen’s Law is clear. The shorthand of “Moore’s Law on steroids” is catchy but incomplete. The economics show that in power-limited AI factories, efficiency (tokens per joule) and utilization (keeping clusters busy) are the true revenue levers. When those improve faster than costs rise, two dynamics follow: Buy more to make more, and buy more to save more. Earnings calls continue to supply supporting evidence: Nvidia cites 10X to 50X efficiency gains, examples of $3 million in infrastructure yielding $30 million in token revenue, and fabric-driven utilization lifts that can make networking effectively free. But we caution that these outcomes only hold under strict conditions —measured end-to-end at the system level, with sustained utilization improvements, when power is truly the limiting constraint; and where demand elasticity supports revenue growth rather than price erosion. For investors and operators, the actionable takeaway is to judge vendors by factory economics, not chip specs alone. The durable winners will be those who compound efficiency and utilization year after year, with software and fabrics carrying as much weight as silicon — while ensuring the efficiency margins accrue to the operator, not just the supplier.

A round-up of the biggest tech-related news that stood out this week. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. News Weekly is our column where we highlight and summarize some of the week's top stories so you can catch up on the latest tech news. This is Android Central's News Weekly, your go-to source for a concise roundup of the week's most significant tech stories. This is where we delve into the top headlines that provide the latest developments and innovations contributing to the digital landscape. This week, Samsung announced another Unpacked event, a Pixel 10 battery feature you can't turn off, Nothing gets caught in the middle of a stock photo scandal, Samsung XR headset's launch could be on the horizon, and everything we know so far about the upcoming Galaxy S25 FE. Read more here Samsung announced this week that it will launch another set of devices soon at its Virtual Unpacked event on Sept 4 at 5 p.m. ET. We may have an idea of what is ahead of us, considering the leaks that have been coming in; however, the teaser hints at nothing more than the arrival of "new" devices. So far, we've had official launches for the Galaxy Buds 3 FE and the Galaxy Tab S10 Lite. Both products have joined Samsung's budget-friendly offerings, and they will also be showcased during this event. Additionally, we've been seeing rumors about a Galaxy S25 FE, another budget phone, as well as the Galaxy Tab S11, along with an alleged Ultra version. We have a pretty packed lineup ahead of us, and the curtain rises next week! Those interested can watch from the Samsung Newsroom, Samsung.com, or the company's YouTube channel. Read more here Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Google's new flagship is here, but here's the catch: apparently, this time around, the tech giant says the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro/XL have a battery feature that's locked and loaded onto the device that users can't disable. The feature called "Battery Health Assistance," introduced on the Google Pixel 9a, is designed to slow down your battery's aging by reducing charging speed and voltage. This feature activates after 200 charge cycles on the Pixel 10 series. Google claims this slow adjustment helps the battery age more evenly and maintain stable performance over time. While this should make your battery last longer, it will also gradually lower your phone's charging speed. This means your device would need to be plugged into the charger for longer, which is a bummer. Read more here Nothing has been caught in the middle of a messy controversy over its marketing of the Phone 3. The tech company was recently spotted using stock images by professional photographers on different cameras, as shots taken on the Phone 3. Android Authority seems to have narrowed down five images that were supposedly captured by their new flagship devices, but were actually licensed photos. The images in question were licensed stock photos and not, as the company stated, "what our community has captured with the Phone (3)." Android Central also received an anonymous tip that showcased a screen recording of a Live Demo Unit (LDU) and screenshots of images reportedly taken by the device. The tipster claimed that these images were not authentic, but rather stock photos, backing their claim with links to the Stills platform. Akis Evangelidis, the co-founder of Nothing, took to X to post a lengthy statement, effectively agreeing to the fact that these images were indeed stock photographs, but he clarified that this was an "unfortunate oversight." Read more here According to a new report (via UploadVR and Google Translate), Samsung will allegedly hold a Galaxy Unpacked event in Korea on September 29, where it'll finally launch Samsung's long-awaited project Moohan. The headset recently passed through certification at the Korea Testing & Research Institute, and will launch "sequentially in global markets" starting in Korea on October 13. As for its price, the report claims the headset could cost around 4 million won, or 1 million short of the Apple Vision Pro. Depending on regional pricing, which is about $1,799 to $2,999, putting it well above the Meta Quest 3. We were able to demo Project Moohan at Google I/O, and it basically exceeded expectations with its "immersive visuals and natural navigation through apps via Gemini voice commands. It felt comfortably balanced with a knob fitting it in place, gesture controls were seamless, and app performance was speedy," AC's Senior Editor Michael Hicks added. Read more here A German publication, Nieuwe Mobiel, spotted an early online listing of the alleged Samsung Galaxy S25 FE on a Portuguese website. The website named MediaMarkt uploaded an entire product page for the Galaxy S25 FE, ahead of its alleged Sept. 4 launch. The page, now taken down, allegedly featured official-looking posters that provided more than enough information on what to expect from the phone. Nieuwe Mobiel was quick enough to download all the images and notes that the S25 FE is expected to be "thinner and lighter. The phone is said to feature a 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED display, measuring 7.4mm in width and weighing approximately 190 grams, which is around 20 grams lighter than its predecessor. The images show the alleged Fan edition in a "Navy Blue" colorway, with noticeably thinner bezels around the screen. Other specifications of the device are expected to include a triple camera array and thinner bezels. Those are some of the biggest stories from this week.

Dave Smith is a writer and editor who previously has been published in Business Insider, Newsweek, ABC News, and USA TODAY. Apple’s Sept. 9 “Awe Dropping” event, announced earlier this week, arrives at a critical moment for one of the world’s most valuable companies as it seeks to maintain momentum following strong third-quarter earnings that delivered record revenue of $94 billion. The event, scheduled for 1 p.m. Eastern at Apple’s Cupertino, Calif., headquarters, represents the opening phase of a reported three-year transformation strategy, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, that’s designed to reinvent Apple’s hardware ecosystem. The timing carries particular significance as Apple faces mounting challenges in artificial intelligence, in which the company has struggled to keep pace with competitors and recently faced an antitrust lawsuit from Elon Musk’s xAI over alleged AI monopolization. Apple’s stock has been hit particularly hard, declining roughly 15% to 19% so far in 2025, making it one of the worst performers among the Magnificent Seven tech stocks. The stock lost roughly $75 billion in market value during Apple’s WWDC 2025 keynote in June when the company acknowledged its AI-powered Siri upgrade would be delayed until the following year. Despite these headwinds, Apple’s recent financial performance has shown resilience, with iPhone revenue surging 13.5% to $44.6 billion in the third quarter, partly driven by customers upgrading ahead of potential tariff increases. The September event’s product lineup directly addresses Apple’s strategic priorities by introducing hardware designed to integrate with the company’s Liquid Glass design language: a translucent, depth-focused interface that represents the company’s most significant visual overhaul since iOS 7 in 2013. This design system, inspired by the Vision Pro headset, establishes a unified aesthetic across Apple’s platforms while preparing users for expanded spatial-computing capabilities. The centerpiece of Apple’s Sept. 9 event will reportedly be the ultrathin iPhone 17 “Air,” which would be the first time an iPhone is bestowed with the moniker that was so popular with Apple’s MacBook line two decades ago. The “Air” model is expected to replace the underperforming iPhone Plus in Apple’s product lineup. The device will reportedly measure approximately 5.5mm at its thinnest point, making it significantly thinner than the iPhone 16’s 7.8mm profile and in all likelihood, given the rumored name, the thinnest iPhone ever made. You can see what it looks like in mock-ups here. The iPhone 17 Air is said to feature a 6.6-inch display supporting 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates, which would be the first time non-Pro iPhones to have this feature that makes your iPhone screen look and feel buttery smooth. The device is rumored to sport a hybrid titanium-aluminum frame and weigh approximately 145 grams, substantially lighter than the iPhone 16 Pro’s 199 grams. However, the ultrathin design apparently means some compromises. The phone will reportedly include only a single 48-megapixel rear camera and a smaller battery compared to last year’s flagship iPhones. The USB-C port placement is also said to be off-center, and speaker grilles have been simplified to accommodate the slim profile. Color options reportedly include black, white, light gold, and a light blue shade similar to the MacBook Air. Pricing is expected to match the current iPhone Plus at $899. The standard iPhone 17 is rumored to have a better 24-megapixel front-facing camera that doubles the resolution of current models. All iPhone 17 models will reportedly feature ProMotion 120Hz displays, extending this previously Pro-exclusive feature across the entire lineup. The iPhone 17 Pro models will reportedly showcase a new pill-shaped camera bump that’s larger than previous designs, including a 48-megapixel telephoto lens with up to 8x optical zoom; the iPhone 16 Pro is capable of only 5x optical zoom. The Pro models will also transition to primarily aluminum backs instead of glass, improving durability while reducing weight. Color options for the Pro models will reportedly include a pair of new colors hinted at in Apple’s invitations: orange and blue, as well as the more traditional black, white, and silver options. The event’s thermal-inspired logo appears to reference both the new colors and the rumored vapor chamber cooling system designed to prevent overheating during intensive tasks. The Apple Watch Series 11 will apparently emphasize health-monitoring improvements, potentially introducing blood-pressure trend tracking capabilities—though not full systolic and diastolic readings. The feature would detect hypertension patterns and alert users to consult health care professionals. The Series 11 will reportedly come with an updated S11 chip that may be smaller in design to accommodate larger batteries or additional sensors. The watch may also gain 5G RedCap connectivity from MediaTek, according to MacRumors, which would provide faster data speeds than current LTE-only models. The Apple Watch Ultra 3 will reportedly be the first Apple Watch with stand-alone satellite connectivity, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. This feature will enable emergency SOS functionality and potentially text messaging in remote areas without cellular or Wi-Fi coverage. The Ultra 3 is also said to include improved 5G connectivity and the biggest Apple Watch display to date, which is said to be brighter and better when viewing it from side angles. And an improved charging coil could enable 80% charging in 30 minutes, according to MacRumors. Apple’s third-generation AirPods Pro will reportedly introduce heart-rate monitoring capabilities, using LED optical sensors that can track your heart rate through blood flow in the ear canal. Beyond health features, the AirPods Pro 3 will include improved active noise cancellation, enhanced sound quality, and a faster H3 audio chip. Some reports suggest potential temperature monitoring capabilities and real-time translation features. The new model will feature design refinements including a slimmer form factor and concealed status LED. The Sept. 9 event establishes groundwork for Apple’s long-term vision, with 2026 expected to bring the company’s first foldable iPhone and 2027 potentially introducing an all-glass design for the iPhone’s 20th anniversary. This three-year transformation road map represents Apple’s most ambitious hardware strategy since the original iPhone launch, designed to address mounting competitive pressures and position the company for the next decade. The foldable iPhone is reportedly scheduled for fall 2026 and is rumored to follow a book-style design similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series, reportedly featuring a 7.8-inch inner display and 5.5-inch outer screen. The device will reportedly include four cameras, Touch ID instead of Face ID to save internal space, and Apple’s second-generation cellular modem. Analysts predict a starting price around $2,000, positioning it as Apple’s most expensive smartphone to date. The 2027 “iPhone 20” represents an even more radical departure, featuring four-sided curved glass that eliminates bezels entirely and creates what Bloomberg describes as a “mostly glass, curved iPhone without any cutouts.” This design aligns directly with Apple’s Liquid Glass interface introduced in iOS 26, which emphasizes translucency, depth, and spatial-computing elements inspired by the Vision Pro. The curved-glass approach would fulfill former design chief Jony Ive’s long-held vision of creating a device that appears like “a single sheet of glass.” These hardware advances directly support Apple’s spatial computing ambitions, with CEO Tim Cook reportedly “hell-bent” on launching true AR glasses before Meta can achieve the same milestone. Cook has reportedly made AR glasses his “top priority,” with one Apple engineer stating “Tim cares about nothing else” from a product-development standpoint. The company’s road map reportedly includes lightweight AR glasses expected in 2027, along with multiple Vision Pro iterations through 2028. Apple’s Vision Pro road map includes a small power refresh by the end of 2025, followed by a lighter “Vision Air” model in 2027 that may be up to 40% lighter than the current version. The company is also developing smart glasses similar to Meta’s Ray-Bans as an interim solution while perfecting true AR technology. These products collectively aim to achieve Apple’s goal of shipping over 10 million AR/VR products annually by 2027. The strategic timing aligns with Apple’s broader effort to diversify beyond the iPhone while maintaining its premium market position. Features like iOS 26’s 3D photo effects and spatial interface elements serve as stepping stones toward mainstream AR adoption, gradually acclimating users to spatial-computing concepts before introducing dedicated AR hardware. This measured approach allows Apple to build ecosystem readiness while competitors like Meta and Google rush to market with potentially premature products. Apple’s Awe Dropping event will livestream on the company’s website, YouTube, and Apple TV, on Tuesday, Sept. 9. Based on past iPhone launch events, where Apple holds the event on a Tuesday, preorders typically begin that Friday with general availability launching one week later: In this case, that would mean preorders opening on Sept. 12 and at least some of the new iPhones launching on Sept. 19. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Features like iOS 26’s 3D photo effects and spatial interface elements serve as stepping stones toward mainstream AR adoption, gradually acclimating users to spatial-computing concepts before introducing dedicated AR hardware. This measured approach allows Apple to build ecosystem readiness while competitors like Meta and Google rush to market with potentially premature products. Apple’s Awe Dropping event will livestream on the company’s website, YouTube, and Apple TV, on Tuesday, Sept. 9. Based on past iPhone launch events, where Apple holds the event on a Tuesday, preorders typically begin that Friday with general availability launching one week later: In this case, that would mean preorders opening on Sept. 12 and at least some of the new iPhones launching on Sept. 19.

BitMine Immersion Technologies saw its stock sink nearly 8% this week, yet that didn’t stop Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest from pouring another $15.6 million into the company. The latest move comes during a period of heightened volatility in both equities and crypto markets. According to ARK’s trading disclosures on August 27, the firm bought 339,113 BitMine shares spread across three ETFs. The ARK Innovation ETF acquired 227,569 shares valued at a little over $10 million, while the Next Generation Internet ETF added 70,991 shares worth $3.27 million. The Fintech Innovation ETF purchased another 40,553 shares for $1.87 million. Despite this fresh round of buying, BitMine shares ended the day at $46 before sliding 7.80% in extended trading. Cathie Wood and Ark Invest bought 339,113 shares of Tom Lee’s $BMNR today pic.twitter.com/G9SQY02rDg — Tom Lee Tracker (@TomLeeTracker) August 28, 2025 BitMine’s pivot from Bitcoin mining to an Ethereum-focused treasury earlier this summer has transformed the firm into a major corporate player in crypto. Its balance sheet now holds 1,714,000 ETH, worth about $8.20 billion, alongside 192 Bitcoin and $562 million in cash. That makes BitMine the world’s largest corporate holder of Ethereum. Billionaire investor Peter Thiel has also taken a 9% stake, adding more weight to the firm’s rapid rise. According to latest data, the company’s strategy has fueled sharp price movements in its stock. After surging more than 3,000% to a record high of $135 in early July, shares remain up more than 400% year-to-date despite recent pullbacks. Reports have disclosed that BitMine dramatically expanded its fundraising plans. On August 12, the company filed to boost its at-the-market equity offering from $2 billion to $24.5 billion, a move led by Cantor Fitzgerald and ThinkEquity. Observers say the new funds will give BitMine more firepower to build its Ethereum position. Analysts projected strong gains for Ethereum, predicting $5,500 in the near term and as high as $12,000 by year-end. If those targets materialize and BitMine pushes toward its 5% supply goal, the company could one day rival Michael Saylor’s Strategy in scale. Social media reaction has been quick to frame BitMine as Ethereum’s version of Strategy — a corporate vehicle for institutional exposure to the asset. ARK’s growing position, surpassing $200 million this summer, only strengthens that concept. Yet the risks are just as visible. BitMine’s share price swings highlight how concentrated bets can move violently, even with billions of dollars on the balance sheet.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Good morning from a wet and gloomy London. It's been a real pleasure writing to you each day, but I'm delighted to say your usual host, Dan DeFrancesco, returns from parental leave next week. Not to worry, this isn't quite goodbye. I'll be back in your inbox on Labor Day, and I'll continue working behind the scenes on this newsletter. Oh, and do keep in touch — whether it's feedback, questions, or recommendations for a decent pint in London. I'm at your service. Now, on to today's big story: BI's Jyoti Mann exclusively reports on Meta's race against time to launch one of its latest products. What's on deck: Markets: The brands Morgan Stanley's summer interns are splurging on. Tech: Here's who stands to benefit — and who might suffer — from the AI software shakeout. Business: Dollar General is racing to grow its one hour delivery service. But first, the clock is ticking. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Meta is in a race against time. And there's not long left on the clock. Meta's Superintelligence Labs is under pressure to release one of its first projects by year-end, according to insiders who spoke with BI. This team has been one to watch. Assembled with urgency, Mark Zuckerberg spared no expense, cherry-picking the very best talent. In June, Meta spent a staggering $14 billion to acquire nearly half of Scale AI — then promptly put its 28-year-old cofounder in charge of the Superintelligence push. That's just the tip of the iceberg. Meta has reportedly dangled compensation packages worth hundreds of millions to lure elite researchers from companies like OpenAI and Google DeepMind. But that strategy has rubbed some Meta employees the wrong way. As one former Meta researcher said, watching outsiders walk in with 10 to 50 times the compensation made some longtime staff feel like failures. Unsurprisingly, tensions are flaring. Some workers are threatening to jump ship to rivals. Others say they will quit on the spot to try to force Meta into negotiations. And so, less than two months after its launch, the cracks are beginning to show in Meta's Superintelligence Labs. At least eight employees have already left — including some who'd barely unpacked. Two OpenAI engineers reportedly lasted less than a month. We've seen the superstar hires. We've seen the eye-watering price tags. What we haven't seen? Results. When Meta rolled out its Llama 4 AI models in April, the crowd went mild. Developers felt it underdelivered in key areas like coding, reasoning, and following instructions. Now, BI's Jyoti Mann exclusively reports that the team is scrambling to fix the bugs, revive the product, and ship the next-gen release: Llama 4.X. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London.

Title: Strengthening the sustainability of neglected tropical disease programs in Rwanda: An assessment of access and utilization of domestically-financed services for soil-transmitted helminthiases and schistosomiasis
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371

Full Content:
Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) and schistosomiasis (SCH) infections remain some of the most prevalent neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), causing significant morbidity in most of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), including Rwanda. With dwindling international funding for NTD services and recent commitments focused on other diseases considered easier to eliminate as a public health problem, it is essential to assess domestic financing sources’ scale, efficiency, and effectiveness. The study aims to strengthen domestic efforts towards sustainable financing for neglected tropical disease programs in Africa, particularly in Rwanda. Up to 235 patients from 24 health centers in four districts of Rwanda were sampled for this survey. The districts selected had the highest number of STH and SCH based on routine data from June 2021 to December 2022, which is the window period of the study. We estimated affordability using the lowest-paid government worker (LPGW) and then compared this with household income and expenditure obtained from patients participating in the survey. Data was collected from August to September 2023. Limited secondary data were collected to complement primary data. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to present the findings. The most available drugs were mebendazole, with 100% of facilities reporting no stockout. Praziquantel (PZQ) was the most unavailable drug, reporting 92% stockout at the time of the survey, mainly due to delays in getting supplies from MDA-implementing health facilities. Diagnostics for SCH are the most inaccessible lab services. On average, the total cost (both direct and opportunity cost) to access and utilize STH and SCH services was USD 0.72 (RWF 861.92) and USD 0.96 (RWF 1136.41) for male and female patients, respectively. Although the assessment revealed that treatment for STH and SCH was affordable for the LPGW, women pay a 33% higher cost than men to access NTD services. While services are generally satisfactory, the reimbursement processes are slow, hindering timely access and utilization of SCH and STH services at the health facilities in Rwanda. While the access and utilization of STH and SCH services in health centers are generally promising, the findings underscore the potential for improvement. By addressing the efficiency in the supply of praziquantel drugs and enhancing reimbursement timelines, we can ensure the continuity and effectiveness of these services, offering hope for a brighter future in the fight against neglected tropical diseases. This study explores how Rwanda is working to sustainably finance healthcare services for two neglected tropical diseases—soil-transmitted helminths (STH) and schistosomiasis (SCH)—as international aid for such diseases declines. The research surveyed 235 patients across 24 health centers in districts most affected by these conditions, focusing on how accessible, affordable, and well-utilized these services are under Rwanda’s domestic health financing mechanisms. Key findings show that while basic medications like mebendazole are widely available, others like praziquantel face frequent stockouts due to delayed reimbursements from the CBHI to clinics. Women experience longer travel and waiting times, resulting in higher opportunity costs than men. Yet, out-of-pocket expenses remain low—under USD 1 per visit—suggesting minimal financial risk to patients across income brackets. Patients rated the quality and acceptability of services highly, though most facilities lacked NTD treatment protocols. The study underscores how domestic efforts—such as budget allocations and health insurance coverage—have helped improve access. However, it stresses the need to streamline reimbursement processes and strengthen supply chains to avoid disruptions in drug availability. The findings provide valuable insight for policymakers aiming to reduce dependency on external funding while enhancing equitable access to NTD care.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Health systems across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) pose significant barriers to the population’s access to health services. There are infrastructural gaps, particularly in rural areas, which experience geographical barriers to health facilities, poor medical supplies, and weak digital health infrastructure [1]. Human resource shortages, urban-biased distribution, and governance challenges continue to pose essential access barriers [2]. Apart from these, perhaps the most significant challenge remains financing, where many countries on the continent are far from meeting their health financing goals, e.g., less than seven countries met the Abuja target, and many countries’ out-of-pocket payments remain unacceptably high with low domestic spending and continued reliance on external resources [3]. With increasing anxiety over the long-term financing from external sources exemplified by the exit of USAID and sustainability challenges, one program area of concern is the financing of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). NTDs are diverse communicable yet preventable parasitic, viral, and bacterial diseases that affect over 1.0 billion of the world’s poorest and vulnerable populations primarily in tropical and sub‐tropical settings in Africa, Asia, and the Americas [4–6]. Up to 40% of the affected populations live in Africa, with the poorest and most vulnerable residing in hard-to-reach geographical areas [7–9]. Among the most prevalent NTDs, schistosomiasis (SCH) and soil-transmitted helminths (STH), or intestinal worms, remain a global public health concern and are highly prevalent in low and middle-income countries. They primarily affect poor communities with no access to potable water [10]. It is estimated that about 251.4 million people globally required preventive treatment for SCH in 2021, of which 93% of the total burden is found in sub-Saharan Africa [11]. Despite the existence of treatment and preventive measures, NTDs continue to be responsible for many years of life lost due to disability and premature death among the poor [12]. NTDs, therefore, constitute a disproportionate health burden to marginalized populations and exacerbate inequity. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 3) seek to close the health equity gap and have highlighted NTDs as necessary in achieving this objective. Improving access to NTD services is paramount to the SDGs agenda of reducing disease burden and improving health outcomes for all. Among children, NTDs contribute to disabilities and cognitive impairment, limiting their ability to progress with education and improve their living standards in adulthood [13]. Among adults, NTDs limit productivity and directly impact economic development [14]. Factors that exacerbate the NTD burden include poverty and marginalization, underfunding for health systems, and poor surveillance data [15,16]. The endemicity, the burden, and poor financing of NTDs in Africa are well documented [6,13,16–21]. Rwanda is considered one of the best-performing countries in Africa in its efforts to improve access to health services through public health insurance schemes and increased government spending on healthcare. For example, while Rwanda’s current health expenditure as a share of GDP stands at about 7.2%, its neighbours such as Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda and Tanzania average 3% of GDP as of 2020 [22] However, the country remains endemic for two of the five NTDs amenable to preventive chemotherapy (PC) [23]. National prevalence of SCH ranged between 0% and 70% in areas surrounding water bodies in 2008, and the prevalence has declined significantly over the years, according to recent assessment reports [23,24]. In 2020, data yet to be published by the Rwanda Biomedical Centre (RBC) showed that the threshold for elimination as a public health problem was reached in 97% of high-risk villages selected to assess the impact. In contrast, the national prevalence of STH infections stood at 41% as of 2020 [7,23,25]. However, the 2020 impact assessment found that adults remain the most infected compared to school-aged children, i.e., 48% versus 41%. In light of diminishing international support for NTD programs [26], and to maintain the gains in the fight against NTDs and increase service coverage for all, there is greater emphasis on domestic financing for sustainability. Currently, financing STH, SCH, and other related NTDs in Rwanda heavily depends on external sources. From the approved budgets, the funding for STH and SCH was RWF 6,250.59 million (USD 6.16 million) in the financial year 2021/22 and RWF 9048.54 million (USD 8.46 million) in 2022/23. External sources accounted for almost 92% of overall STH and SCH spending RWF 14,032.71 (USD 13.47 million) in the FYs 2021/22 and 2022/23. However, the government contribution significantly increased from RWF 126.33 (USD 0.12) million in 2021/22 to RWF 1100.388 (USD 1.07) million in 2022/23. Despite the increase in government budget, external funding remains significant and could grossly affect NTD service delivery if abruptly cut. To reduce dependency on external funding for NTDs, the government aims to increase budget allocation to account for at least 40% of the NTD budget to ensure sustainability [27]. Alongside budget increases, the Rwandan Government has improved access to NTD services by rolling out bi-annual mass drug administration (MDA), ensuring that over 65 million treatments against intestinal worms and schistosomiasis were delivered to children aged 1–15 years since 2008 [28]. The government has taken further steps to improve access to NTD treatment and preventive services by progressively integrating NTDs into the national health insurance benefit package- the Community-Based Health Insurance (CBHI) scheme. Rwanda’s CBHI scheme was initiated by the Rwandan Government in 2005 to spread the financial burden of medical costs and ensure that the poor and vulnerable households have access to essential health services without incurring a financial burden [29]. The government subsidizes the CBHI scheme at almost 50% of the total funding [29–31]. The benefits package includes comprehensive preventive and curative services and essential drugs at health centers and referral hospitals. Integrating NTDs into the routine health services delivery system is a crucial indicator for domestic financing and is considered a key step toward sustainable NTD programming in endemic countries [32]. While the efforts to eliminate NTDs through sustainable financing in Rwanda are commendable, there are empirical gaps on whether the current funding from domestic sources (government and public insurance) has improved NTD service availability, affordability, and optimized utilization by the population to contribute toward sustainable elimination. For instance, STH and SCH services are expected to be available and affordable to all those in need of the services, but the range of services covered, their availability, demand, and utilization, and who bears the cost burden in trying to access SCH and STH services, is not well-understood in Rwanda. The aim of this study is, therefore, to provide evidence on the implications of public financing of NTDs on service access. This will assist the government and the CBHI in improving domestic resource mobilization and allocation for effective and sustainable NTD elimination. A protocol was submitted to the Ethics and Scientific Review Committee of the Rwanda National Research Ethics Committee (RNEC) and the Rwanda Biomedical Centre (RBC). Approval for the study was received from RNEC (RNEC-IRB 0001497 of I0RGOOO1100) on August 11, 2023—collaboration letter from the Rwanda Biomedical Centre (RBC), Ref. No M84/RBC/2023, provided a human subjects exemption for this research on 13 October 2023. The study relied mainly on primary survey data collected through exit interviews. Secondary data were collected to inform the NTD financing situation in Rwanda and to understand the government budget for operational costs related to mass drug administration (MDA). This study was conducted in 24 randomly selected health centers in four Rwanda districts: Gisagara, Rubavu, Burera, and Rutsiro. These are amongst the districts with the co-endemicity for STH and Schistosomiasis as reported in the Rwanda NTDs Strategic Plan 2019–2024 [24]. In addition, these districts had a high number of STH and SCH, all combined from June 2021 to December 2022, which is the window period of the study. All the selected health centers were providing STH and SCH services (deworming medications including albendazole, mebendazole, and praziquantel; diagnostics for Schistosomiasis (SCH) and STH or intestinal worms) covered by the CBHI scheme. The sample size was calculated using the SCH and STH facility visits data for 2022, which was estimated at 207,572 visits. Assuming each of the 24 facilities had an equal number of visits during the year 2022, each facility received about 8649 SCH and STH patients, which translates to about 24 visits per day in each facility. Aiming for a higher sample size, the study chose to interview 50% of the census sample, i.e., every second patient in each facility was interviewed, which gave a total sample size of 288 SCH and STH patients. 235 patients were accepted to participate in the study, with an acceptable response rate of about 82%. In addition, 24 facility in-charges from the 24 health facilities were interviewed to assess stock levels of SCH and STH drugs. A total of four data collectors were assigned responsibility for collecting data at each of the 24 facilities. Each two-person team split responsibility between collecting facility data of individual facilities and interviewing individual study participants to assess the availability, affordability, and utilization of STH and SCH services. Data collection was completed between August and September 2023. Exit interview participants were recruited from the 24 facilities among the target populations in need of STH and SCH services who came to a study site seeking these services. Individual participants were selected after they had received STH and SCH services at the respective facility. The research assistants explained the study to each potential participant, using an approved recruitment script, and all respondents were asked if they were willing to voluntarily participate in the study. All willing participants signed a consent form after acknowledging their understanding of the purpose of the study. Exit interviews were conducted with each eligible participant based on their willingness to participate. The information collected included demographic characteristics of the respondents (age, religion, membership in a health insurance scheme, marital status, individual income, household income, level of education, employment status), transport costs, amount paid for drugs, travel time to and from the facility, and waiting time. English and Kinyarwanda translations of the participant and facility questionnaires were loaded onto a mobile data collection application, KoBoCollect, which was used to record responses. In this study, we considered three key dimensions of access [33] which include: (i) availability of services (drugs and non-drug pharmaceuticals, physical accessibility including distance to facility and travel time, and availability of qualified staff (ii) affordability of services including cost of medicine, travel costs, cost of consultation incurred concerning tests/investigations, other indirect costs); (iii) acceptability of services such as social and cultural context (gender) affecting accessibility, and individual patient perceptions of quality of services. Accessibility was assessed using the WHO availability target of greater than or equal to 80%. Affordability was estimated based on the average monthly wage for the lowest-paid government worker (LPGW). From an economic costing perspective, affordability was also estimated using direct financial expenses and opportunity costs. Costs to STH and SCH patients are largely restricted to the charges for the transport costs incurred from home to the treatment site and opportunity costs. The out-of-pocket costs included round-trip transportation costs, which were assessed through the exit interviews, and the time required for obtaining treatment, which included the round-trip travel time to the facility, waiting time, and time for consultation until exit from the facility. The patient’s daily earnings give an estimate of the value of time spent at the health facility. Data were analyzed using STATA version 17. Simple descriptive statistics assessed the availability, affordability, and utilization/demand of the selected STH and SCH drugs and related services. An availability of 80% or higher was used as the benchmark for accessibility as per WHO guidelines [34]. The combined availability of commodities that were surveyed was calculated to provide the overall availability of that specific commodity at the facility. Stockout information was sought from all the selected STH and SCH commodities covered by the CBHI scheme, which were supposed to be available at that level of care, regardless of whether they were in or out of stock at the time of the survey. Stockout was calculated as the percentage of facilities that reported at least one stockout of the selected STH and SCH commodity over the measured period, with stockout days calculated as the average number of days stockouts of a commodity lasted per facility. To calculate affordability, the median price of the entire treatment course of a commodity was compared to the official salary of the lowest-paid government worker (LPGW), per day in 2023. If a commodity price exceeded one day’s wages, it would be considered unaffordable based on the World Bank’s international poverty line (IPL) of USD 2.15 per person per day. Accessibility was calculated using the availability and LPGW affordability measures. This resulted in a composite measure in which accessibility is achieved with an 80% or higher availability and a price of less than a day’s wage for an LPGW. The results were then compared with information on income and expenditure obtained from patients participating in the survey. The results, presented in Table 1, revealed that the respondents tended to be young, with 39.2% under 30 years old. About the same number of respondents were single and never married (28%) or were living together (28.1%). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t001 As depicted in Fig 1, almost all the patients (99%) received consultation services, 29.8% received SCH diagnostic services, and 85% received STH diagnostics. A third of the respondents (33%) received the prescribed albendazole medicine, and 66.8% and 12.8% received the prescribed mebendazole and praziquantel medicines. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.g001 Regarding stockouts of STH and SCH drugs on the day of the survey (Fig 2), 22 (92%) out of the 24 facilities did not have praziquantel drugs, and 11 (46%) had no diagnostics for STH or intestinal worms. In comparison, diagnostics for schistosomiasis were unavailable in 14 (58%) of the facilities. However, mebendazole drugs were available in all 24 health facilities. Note that, as the primary strategy for the NTD elimination programs, preventive chemotherapy (PC) employs anthelmintics, such as albendazole (ADZ) or mebendazole (MBDZ) for STHs, ADZ and diethylcarbamazine (DEC) and/or ivermectin (IVM) for LF and onchocerciasis, and praziquantel (PZQT) for SCH [35]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.g002 The stockout of STH/SCH drugs forced patients to either use an alternative drug, e.g., mebendazole in place of albendazole, or to visit the facility another day when supplies were available. Alternatively, those who could afford it were advised by health workers to purchase at private facilities. As noted by the study, one of the major contributors to drug stockouts is a delay in receiving reimbursements for services provided. At the time of the survey, 23 out of the 24 facilities in the sample indicated that they experienced delays in receiving reimbursements from the CBHI through the Rwanda Social Security Board (RSSB) for services provided during FY 2021/22 and FY 2022/23. Table 2 presents the estimated number of months of delays in receiving the funds. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t002 About 75% of the facilities experienced 2–4 months of delays. The respondents cited several causes for the delays, including errors in preparing the invoice (37.5%), delays in submitting the invoice by the facilities (45.8%), delayed reimbursement from the CBHI scheme (79.2%), and delays in verifying the invoices (20.8%). The delayed reimbursement does not affect SCH and STH services alone, but the availability of all services is affected since health facilities cannot replenish their entire stocks before funds are made available. The study also considered the time taken to receive services (travel and waiting time) as a measure of availability in the timely use of NTD services. On average, women spent more time than men receiving NTD services (307.4 minutes or 5.0 hours for women compared to 238.5 minutes or 4.0 hours for men). In travel time, women spent about 95.93 minutes (approximately 2 hours) traveling to health facilities versus 78.94 minutes (approximately 1.3 hours) spent by men. Similarly, average time spent with the clinician, average waiting time, and average time after consultation to exit the facility were approximately 159.6 minutes (approximately 2.6 hours) for male patients and 211.5 minutes (3.5 hours) for female patients (Table 3). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t003 There was no immediate explanation for the differences between men and women in the time taken to receive services. However, less travel time and higher transport costs for men compared to women indicate that more men than women used motorbikes or other faster and more expensive means of transportation to the health facility. This suggests an economic advantage for men in accessing health facilities. A summary of patients’ indirect costs (cost of travel and waiting time), direct costs, and total costs for accessing STH and SCH treatment is presented in Table 4. The average total cost (including both direct and opportunity costs) to access and utilize STH and SCH services was US$0.72 (RWF 834.08) and US$0.96 (RWF 1,112.11) for male and female respondents, respectively. The average total cost for the opportunity costs accounted for 1.5% (US$0.45 or RWF 521.30) of the total average cost per day for male respondents. In comparison, the opportunity cost for female respondents accounted for 2.4% (US$0.68 or RWF 787.75) of the total cost per day. The out-of-pocket costs for transportation fares amounted to $0.09 (RWF 104.26) and $0.06 (RWF 69.51) for male and female respondents, respectively. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t004 The findings indicate that the average daily income was highest among male respondents at RWF1,784.01 (US$1.54) against RWF 1,702.92 (US$1.47) for females. The results show disparity in the costs for male and female respondents, which is largely driven by the amount of travel time and, hence, the cost per round trip. Table 5 presents the total average cost of time for the daily visits. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t005 The total cost to patients accessing STH and SCH services for a month was compared with the average monthly household income (Table 5). The results show that male patients paid direct costs of nearly US$0.28 (about 0.95% of average household income per month) for a month (assuming one visit to the health facility per month) to access treatment services at the facilities. The share of direct costs paid by female patients was US$0.28, which is about 0.99% of the average household income per month of US$28.30. The direct costs combined with indirect costs produced a total mean cost burden of US$0.72 or 3.4% of household income per month for male patients and a mean total cost per month of US$0.96 or 2.5% of average monthly household income for female patients (Fig 3). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.g003 The total direct and indirect costs as a share of household income are presented in Table 6. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t006 The results show that the poorest households spent about 3.3% of their income on STH and SCH care. On the other hand, those in the middle—and upper-income brackets spent between 1.7% and 2.5% of their income on STH and SCH care and treatment. The wealthiest households with an income of RWF 250,000 spent 4.7% on STH and SCH treatment and care. These findings, including on the expenditures of LPGW, show no real financial risk involving catastrophic payments for STH and SCH services. These findings show that the cost burden of SCH and STH services is progressive because of government subsidies that target low-income earners. Higher income brackets are also likely to spend more on faster means of transportation and also pay out of pocket during stockouts. Costs by district show Rubavu District is the most expensive for those seeking SCH and STH services. Women incur the highest cost averaging about USD 1.37 against men who incur USD 0.83 per trip (Table 7). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t007 In addition to cost, the quality of services is an important determinant of using STH and SCH services. In this study, respondents were asked to record their level of satisfaction concerning: (i) quality of treatment received, ii) privacy and confidentiality, iii) timeliness in the provision of services, (iv) facility cleanliness and hygiene, (v) attitude towards patients, (vi) overall rating. A rating scale (excellent, good, fair, and poor) was used. Most respondents (78.3%) rated the services provided as good, while 17.5% rated them as fair and 1.7% rated the services as poor. Other aspects of acceptability (e.g., cleanliness and hygiene, privacy of treatment and waiting time, and staff attitude) were similar, indicating that an overwhelming majority of the respondents viewed the services as acceptable (Table 8). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t008 In addition, the study assessed the availability of treatment protocols as a measure of improved patient-centered outcomes. The survey results revealed that 21 (88%) of the facilities did not have NTD treatment protocols for various NTDs, and only three facilities reported availability of treatment protocols for NTDs. The utilization of STH and SCH services decreased slightly from 215,267 OPD visits in 2021–207,572 OPD visits in 2022 (Table 9). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t009 The data show that most STH and SCH patients were treated asymptomatically. Patients receiving intestinal worm medications (mebendazole or albendazole) accounted for 82.3% of the total outpatient (OPD) visits over the two years. In contrast, diagnostics accounted for 17.3% of the visits for STH and 4% for SCH. In terms of utilization by district, the health facilities in Burera district accounted for 29.1% and 29.7%, respectively, of the total utilization of STH and SCH services, followed by Rubavu, which accounted for 26.7% and 26.2% in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Facilities in the Gisagara district reported the lowest utilization, at 17.7% in 2021 and 18.8% in 2022 (Table 10). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t010 The number of OPD visits for all STH and SCH services during the two years declined slightly, except for intestinal worm medication. The largest drop in outpatient utilization (OPD) was observed in the diagnostics for Schistosomiasis (from 1732 OPD visits in 2021–136 OPD visits in 2022), followed by patients for deworming medications (mebendazole), whose utilization declined from 79,233 in 2021–70,826. There are concerns about access and sustainability of health services in general and NTD programs in particular due to overreliance on external funding and low domestic investments. Sustainability means the capacity of a health system to maintain the gains toward NTD prevention and control on the path to elimination. Poor access to NTD services has broader policy implications beyond the health system. It imposes an economic burden by reducing productivity and contributes to a cycle of poverty and social exclusion [36]. Late-stage presentations of most NTDs are not just fatal but are a significant burden to health facilities and jeopardize progress toward Universal Health Coverage. The United Nations SDGs recognize universal access to NTD services as integral to achieving UHC [37]. On the other hand, children afflicted with NTDs have lower educational achievement as NTDs increase absenteeism and cognitive impairment, therefore potentially contributing to lower social status [13,38]. As a largely neglected program in many low- and middle-income countries, countries are encouraged to invest domestic resources to control and eliminate NTDs. In Rwanda, the bulk (90%) of funding for STH and SCH prevention and elimination is external. However, the Rwanda Government has progressively relied less on external support to control and eliminate NTDs. The steps include (i) the introduction of a budget line for procurement of NTD drugs, (ii) the design and delivery of a package of NTD care under the CBHI scheme, (iii) the adoption of one health policy that commits to enhance collaboration of different actors of NTD stakeholders, (iv) budget allocation for MDA operational costs, and (v) decentralization of NTD interventions and integration of NTD prevention efforts to the village level under district coordination. The study focused on understanding how public domestic financing through the Rwandan government’s introduction of a budget line for NTD drugs and financing under the CBHI scheme has influenced access to and utilization of SCH and STH services in Rwanda. The introduction of a budget vote influences access to healthcare by guaranteeing a resource basket, affecting the funding available for health services [39]. In so doing, it contributes to financial risk protection by lowering the cost of care for individuals. There is a growing body of literature on NTD service access (availability, affordability, and utilization) with mixed results [16,40–42]; e.g., in Ethiopia, Kassahun et al. [40] showed that service availability is relatively good with up to 64% of all health facilities offering STH services, but only 40% had SCH services. Our findings show a similar trajectory of inconsistency in the availability of SCH and STH drugs; e.g., praziquantel is the least available medicine with a stockout rate of 92% because of delays in receiving supplies from MDA implementing health facilities. This is followed by albendazole, received by just 33% of patients seeking care. On the other hand, mebendazole was the most available drug with 100% facilities stocked. In other NTDs, Ooms et al. [41] report low availability of snakebite commodities (43%) in public health facilities. Similarly, the Ethiopian Public Health Institute [43] found that the availability of drugs for NTD treatment varied by facility type, with hospitals more likely than lower-level facilities to be stocked. One of the most cited causes of stockouts of essential drugs is delayed reimbursements to health facilities to allow for timely re-stocking of commodities [44,45]. The consequences of a lack of availability of essential NTD services are not only costly to those seeking care but also discourage repeat visits, which constitutes a barrier to NTD control and elimination. The reimbursements to facilities need to be predictable and the supply chain strengthened, to ensure consistency in the availability of critical NTD services, particularly those prepaid through publicly financed institutions. The availability of SCH and STH services is hampered by distance to health facilities, with women disproportionately affected. Of the 85% of the respondents who walked to a health facility, women spent on average 96 minutes compared to 79 minutes spent by men. The extra time spent by women traveling to health facilities not only has cost implications but also constitutes a physical barrier to accessing NTD services. Although the government took steps to reduce walking time to facilities by 50% (from 95 minutes to 47 minutes) in 2020 [46], the evidence suggests that there are still significant challenges in accessing health facilities in some districts. The steps taken by the government include the construction of health posts and the deployment of community health workers to bring services closer to communities [46]. The use of CHWs to bring NTD services closer to the communities has been proven effective in malaria control and improving maternal and child health services [47,48]. It is highly recommended for effective and sustainable control and elimination of NTDs. What remains encouraging in Rwanda is that SCH and STH services remain essentially affordable with no evidence of catastrophic expenses. Usually, out-of-pocket health expenditure is considered catastrophic and impoverishing when a household is forced to cut down on subsistence needs, sell productive assets, incur debts, or utilize savings to meet health needs [34,41,49,50]. Similar to this study, Dong et. al. [51] reported better affordability overall but also noted a large gap between the affordability levels of originator brands (OBs) and lowest-priced generics (LPGs) of essential drugs in Ethiopia. The affordability of SCH and STH services in Rwanda was primarily influenced by travel and waiting time, whose costs were higher than the expenses for the actual NTD services at health facilities. Noting that the indirect medical expenses disproportionately affected women calls for considering the driving factors in the analysis of access to NTD services in a low-resource setting, such as Rwanda. Women spent about a dollar more than men to access health facilities- a cost mainly attributed to more extended travel and waiting time, which are likely to be an important determinant of STH and SCH services utilization. Saxena et al. [52] have reported cost-related disparities between men and women in access to healthcare. Affordability is a critical determinant of access to health services in most settings, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Generally, essential health services are found to be relatively unaffordable to many people [16,42,49,53–55]. However, treatment costs for STH and SCH services are affordable in a low-income setting, requiring only 13% of a day’s wages from the LPGW. This suggests that NTD control and prevention is one of the best buys in public health available to those affected community members. Studies such as Ooms et. al. [40] have also demonstrated the affordability of NTD services, excluding snake anti-venoms, which are found to be unaffordable to most households in Kenya. Governments should, therefore, be encouraged to invest more in NTD control and elimination as a less costly alternative to the continued neglect of NTDs. Rwanda currently funds operational costs of MDAs, which indicates that significant costs can be domestically resourced when appropriately prioritized through political commitment, effective advocacy, governance, multisectoral coordination structures, and integration within the broader health system budgeting and planning processes. Evidence of steady demand and utilization of STH and SCH services in Rwanda indicates efficiency in the use of investments in NTDs, wherein the target population utilizes the services purchased; i.e., the population’s NTD needs are well aligned with the services purchased. There is also a clear linkage between service use and the reported high patient satisfaction with the services offered. However, the demand and utilization can still be improved with timely reimbursements to health facilities and a strengthened procurement and supply chain for NTD commodities. Satisfaction with health services is a contentious issue, especially in LMIC, with many reporting poor services associated mainly with poor staff attitude, ineffective physician consultations, and inefficient admission process [52,53]. However, in Ghana, there was an overwhelming majority (>95%) of patients who had a positive perception of the quality of services [19]. Our study reported 95.3% satisfaction with SCH and STH services, which means that, although the quality of services is generally low in low-resource settings, there is evidence from both the Ghanaian and Rwandan experiences that this can change for the better. The WHO emphasizes that the goals of UHC cannot be effectively achieved if the quality of services is not satisfactory. The surest way to sustain and eliminate neglected diseases is to combine adequate domestic financing with improved access to and utilization of quality NTD services. This combination needs to be approached from an equity lens, considering the identified gender gaps in access to SCH and STH services. The study is aware of biases related to self-reported data and ensured that the data collected from individual participants were triangulated with discussions with health workers. Micro-level gaps, such as socioeconomic indicators and behavioral determinants of health, were either not relevant to the objective of the study or addressed by having well-trained interviewers to ensure data consistency. The generalizability concerns have been addressed through triangulated data sources and a non-biased sampling process of 24 primary health facilities in different districts representing urban, peri-urban, and rural areas. However, the study acknowledges that the small sample size focusing on primary health facilities may limit generalization in hospital settings. We sincerely appreciate all the respondents who took the time to participate in the survey. We are also grateful to the senior staff at the Rwanda Biomedical Center (RBC) and the Ministry of Health for their kind support during the entire data collection period. We also thank the facility in-charges for their cooperation during this study.

Title: What’s Driving Amazon Stock To New Highs?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/08/29/whats-driving-amazon-stock-to-new-highs/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. In early 2023, Amazon's stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) was trading at a modest $84. Today, it has soared to $232, a stunning 176% jump that significantly outpaces the broader NASDAQ index's 2x rise. So, what's fueling this incredible surge? The answer lies in three critical factors: But the question remains: Can this powerhouse performance continue? We’ll dive into what’s driving this momentum and what the future holds for Amazon. But if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – CoreWeave Stock To $200? Beyond its sheer size, Amazon's revenue growth is driven by a hidden engine: a powerful shift in its business model. While its e-commerce sales are impressive, they are no longer the primary force. The real story lies in the company's strategic diversification, with three key areas serving as the main catalysts for its recent surge. The undisputed heavyweight champion of Amazon's growth is Amazon Web Services (AWS). This cloud computing arm has proven to be an exceptionally valuable asset, far outpacing the growth of Amazon's traditional retail operations. While North American and international sales grew by 23% and 21% respectively between 2022 and 2024, AWS revenue surged by a solid 34% over the same period. Its high-margin, scalable services for businesses, governments, and individuals make it the company's most important growth engine. Another crucial, and often overlooked, driver of Amazon's financial success is its rapidly expanding digital advertising business. Much like Google and Meta, Amazon has leveraged its vast customer data and massive platform to become a dominant player in the ad world. This segment, which includes sponsored product listings and display ads, has been growing at a remarkable pace, providing a high-profit-margin revenue stream that diversifies the company's earnings beyond e-commerce and cloud services. Amazon's third major growth driver is its subscription services, most notably its Prime membership, which has evolved into a comprehensive ecosystem of benefits beyond free shipping to include streaming video and music, exclusive deals, and more. This has created a loyal and engaged customer base that not only pays a recurring fee but also spends more on Amazon's platform than non-Prime members. This steady, predictable revenue stream provides a solid financial foundation and strengthens the company's competitive moat. Looking ahead, these drivers face a new challenge: the intense competition in the AI arms race. AWS's leadership in cloud computing is being challenged by rivals like Microsoft (Azure) and Google (Cloud), who are making massive investments in generative AI. Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI and Google's rapid expansion of AI services pose a significant threat. To maintain its market leadership, Amazon is also pouring tens of billions into AI-related capital expenditures, a strategic move that will shape its future and determine if its extraordinary growth can continue. Amazon's stunning rise in valuation can be attributed to its dramatic financial transformation, where a once-unprofitable e-commerce giant has become a profit-making powerhouse. This shift has reshaped investor sentiment and sent its valuation soaring. The most significant catalyst behind this change is AWS. This high-margin cloud business has single-handedly revolutionized Amazon's profitability. Since 2022, Amazon's operating margin has skyrocketed by an astounding 377%, climbing from a meager 2.4% to a robust 11.4%. This incredible expansion in profitability, fueled by AWS, is the key reason investors are now willing to pay a premium for Amazon's stock. It signals a new era of sustainable, high-quality earnings. This surge in profitability, combined with strong revenue growth and the strategic expansion of AWS, has directly impacted Amazon’s valuation. Investors now value the company as a technology and cloud leader. As a result, the company's price-to-sales valuation multiple has ballooned by 124%, jumping from 1.7x trailing revenues in 2022 to an impressive 3.7x today. This multiple expansion is a direct reflection of the market's newfound confidence in Amazon's long-term profit potential. At its current price of around $230, Amazon's stock is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.7x, which aligns closely with its five-year average of 3.2x. However, there are compelling reasons to believe the valuation multiple could expand further. See, AI is not just a buzzword for Amazon; it's a strategic weapon poised to supercharge its growth and reshape its financial future. The company's massive investments in artificial intelligence are set to ignite a new wave of expansion across its entire business empire. Within AWS, AI is the new frontier. As businesses race to develop and deploy their own AI applications, they are driving unprecedented demand for AWS's cloud infrastructure. This isn't just about incremental growth; it's a direct catalyst for skyrocketing cloud sales, solidifying AWS's position as a profit powerhouse. In fact, if you want a detailed breakdown of how this growth can help Amazon's stock, take a look at our analysis – Amazon Stock: Path to 2x Growth – which highlights the key factors. But the AI revolution isn't limited to the cloud. On the retail side, AI is being woven into the very fabric of the shopping experience. Think smarter product recommendations, lightning-fast search, and deeply personalized storefronts. These aren't just minor upgrades—they're powerful tools designed to boost sales, increase the value of every order, and make advertising on the platform more effective than ever. This enhanced ad targeting will also extend its influence across the wider digital advertising landscape, creating a lucrative new revenue stream. All of this adds up to a compelling financial outlook. Amazon projects low double-digit sales growth over the next three years, with its bottom-line profits expected to grow even faster. This blend of accelerating profitability, continued AWS dominance, and an ironclad grip on the e-commerce market, presents a powerful case for a higher valuation. Investors are already taking notice, recognizing that Amazon's strategic AI initiatives are not just a plan—they're the blueprint for a new era of growth and value creation. Despite its powerful rise, Amazon’s stock is not without its vulnerabilities. Its history is marked by sharp drops that have far outpaced the broader market, highlighting both its inherent volatility and remarkable resilience. During the 2022 inflation-driven market sell-off, Amazon stock plunged a staggering 52%, a far steeper decline than the S&P 500's 25% drop. The stock's recovery took over a year, not regaining its previous high until February 2024. More recently, during periods of heightened trade war concerns, the pattern repeated—Amazon plummeted 30% while the S&P 500's peak-to-trough decline was a more modest 19%. This history shows that when markets turn, Amazon can fall harder and faster than its peers. Beyond market-wide shocks, the company faces significant company-specific risks. A primary concern is its massive capital expenditure. Since 2022, Amazon has invested a colossal $257 billion in CapEx. This is a high-stakes gamble, and a critical question looms: What if these massive investments don't yield the returns investors expect? Simultaneously, the explosive growth of its core profit driver, AWS, could be threatened by intense competition from rivals like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. A slowdown in AWS growth, combined with concerns over the payback on its huge investments, could create a challenging scenario. For a deeper dive into these risks, including the factors that could cause a severe downturn, we've captured a full downside scenario in our separate analysis: How Amazon Stock Falls By 50%? See, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single, or just a handful, of stocks. Consider the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: A New Vision For Money: Hoskinson Predicts Bitcoin Will Hit $10 Trillion

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Charles Hoskinson, a founder of Ethereum and the driving force behind Cardano, laid out a sweeping forecast for crypto markets and payments this week. He predicted Bitcoin could reach $250,000 in the current market cycle and said the token’s total market value might hit $10 trillion in the next five years. Reports have disclosed that he links that outlook to new US stablecoin rules and what he calls clearer market structure. In an interview on the David Lin Report, Hoskinson argued that Bitcoin’s design made it strong as a store of value but limited as a global payments rail. He pointed to the old “big block” debates that pushed the network toward saving rather than everyday payments. Layer Two solutions, he said, are where Bitcoin gains the speed and lower cost needed for daily use. This framing leaves room for other blockchains to offer broader financial services. Hoskinson framed Cardano as an alternative path — one built on research and formal methods rather than rapid experimentation. Based on reports, the network has operated continuously for about eight years and uses a proof-of-stake model that many users back. Reports also state that over 70% of ADA in circulation has been staked by holders who support the network. That figure is commonly cited when comparing Cardano’s staking take-up to other blockchains. Stablecoins are central to Hoskinson’s case. He told lawmakers and audiences that tokens tied to fiat could give people in countries with weak local currencies access to dollar-like stability. According to White House materials, the GENIUS Act has moved through the political process and was signed into law by US President Donald Trump, creating a new US framework for stablecoins. Based on data, the stablecoin market has topped $250 billion in supply, a milestone that regulators and banks are watching closely. Hoskinson was blunt about exchanges and the stock market. He called current exchange practices “preposterous” and criticized systems that rely on centralized trust, including large listing fees and gatekeeping by a few firms. He said decentralized exchanges — where the protocol enforces rules — could cut out those middlemen and give people more control over their assets. That pitch fits a wider industry argument for moving custody and trade settlement onto public blockchains. For Hoskinson, Bitcoin will stay digital gold, while stablecoins, tokenized assets, and decentralized systems grow around it. The real question, he suggests, is not only how high Bitcoin’s price can go, but how the movement of money will be reshaped.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Full Content:
UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 29 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR, who will share fresh data, perspectives and insights from the latest survey data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 80 – UiPath’s Unconventional $PATH to IPO – UiPath is going public this coming week and will be the next hot software company to IPO. It has had a long strange trip to IPO.

Episode 79 – Moore’s Law is Accelerating and AI is Ready to Explode – Moore’s Law is dead right? Think again. While the historical annual CPU performance improvement of ~40% is slowing, the combination of CPUs packaged with alternative processors is improving at a rate of more than 100% per annum. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is going to unveil some data that suggests we’re entering a new era of innovation where inexpensive processing capabilities will power an explosion of machine intelligence applications. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 78 – Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel’s Feet – Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China.
