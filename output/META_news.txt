The feature from tokenization firm Backed, rolled out on centralized exchanges Kraken and Bybit this week in certain regions and also launched natively on the Solana blockchain, allows traders to gain exposure to popular American equities like Meta, Netflix, Coinbase, McDonald’s, and more on-chain. In other words, eligible users can swap crypto or fiat for stocks on the aforementioned exchanges, or swap any Solana token for the xStock of their choosing via decentralized protocols like Jupiter or Raydium. still can't believe you can now swap between fartcoin and USA stocks, permissionlessly, across the globe with just an internet connection and a solana wallet internet capital markets pic.twitter.com/8Mmyy47dnz — mert | helius.dev (@0xMert_) June 30, 2025 While tokenized stocks, or the process of putting shares of companies on-chain, is not a new idea, xStocks differs from previous implementations that simply reflected the price of an off-chain asset with a “mirrored” asset on-chain. Instead, each xStock token is backed 1:1 by the underlying asset which is held by a regulated third-party. In other words, a user that purchases a share of Apple on-chain via xStocks is assured that their single share of Apple is held in custody and redeemable at any time. “For the first time, people all over the world can own and use a share of a tokenized stock like they would use money. You can move it, hold it, spend it, or borrow against it. All from your wallet, with no intermediaries, no borders and no delays,” said Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi in a statement about the platform’s xStock launch. According to Backed, trading tokenized stocks like xStocks offers a handful of benefits that users trading via a traditional brokerage would not get. For example, xStocks allows users to trade 24/7, while a brokerage is subject to the stock market’s hours. Additionally, their use on global blockchains allows participants in other geographies to gain exposure to the American stock market, and for trades to take place without broker commissions. It also makes equities available for use in decentralized finance (DeFi). While Kraken and Bybit have tapped Backed and its xStocks product for its tokenized equities, other platforms are looking to build their own tokenized product suites. Coinbase has been seeking regulatory approval to offer tokenized stocks on its platform, with its Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal calling that approval a “huge priority” in June. Furthermore, Robinhood announced Monday that it is rolling out tokenized stock trading to its European users, allowing them to trade U.S.-listed stocks via Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum. The firm also plans to launch its own dedicated layer-2 blockchain powered by Arbitrum, and migrate the service to that chain.

Title: These Stocks Soared in the First Half of 2025. Can They Keep It Up?

The stock market shook off one of its worst sell-offs in recent memory to finish the first half of 2025 on a high note. That's lifted stocks associated with AI, crypto—and gold. How did we get here? It's been a ride. Stocks plummeted in early April after President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping global tariffs that threatened to scramble global supply chains, spike prices, and slow growth. Trump's subsequent pause of those tariffs, however, ignited a rally that was further fueled by benign economic data and easing trade tensions. By the end of June, stocks had rebounded to record highs. Wall Street's latest rally has looked a bit like last year's bull market. Artificial intelligence continued to connect many of the market's winners. But a few new themes have emerged amid the Trump administration's shake-up of the status quo. Here, we'll examine the stock market's leaders from the first six months of 2025—and examine how the forces underlying their gains could evolve in the next six. Crypto investors have been handsomely rewarded for the industry’s spending on November’s election. The industry last year spent more than $100 million in support of pro-crypto candidates. In January, the “most pro-crypto Congress” in history was sworn in and Washington wasted little time giving the industry what it wanted. Federal regulators have dropped pending litigation against cryptocurrency companies. Trump signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin reserve. In May, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which would establish a framework for the regulation of cryptocurrencies, was introduced in the House of Representatives. And the Senate in June passed the GENIUS Act, legislation that establishes rules governing stablecoins. That's helped grow the cryptocurrency market's value to more than $3.2 trillion. Washington’s embrace, however, has also boosted related stocks this year. Robinhood (HOOD) stock more than doubled in price in the first half, while Coinbase (COIN) shares rose 41%. Circle Internet Group’s (CRCL) shares more than doubled during the stablecoin issuer’s first day of trading in early June; the stock rose nearly 750% in the two weeks after its debut. The cryptocurrency legislation working its way through Congress is expected to have little trouble making its way to Trump’s desk for signature in the second half of this year. Trump and his family may continue feeding the industry’s animal spirits with new crypto ventures. Analysts came into the year expecting the group of stocks considered emblematic of the AI trade to change. That has panned out to an extent. Leadership was expected to shift from AI infrastructure stocks—companies like Nvidia (NVDA), whose chips fill the data centers that cloud computing giants like Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) use to train and run AI models—to software and services providers developing and monetizing AI applications. Palantir (PLTR) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in the first half of the year; its impressive sales and earnings growth have been driven primarily by its AI software. Social media giant Meta Platforms (META) is the Magnificent Seven’s best performer year-to-date thanks in part to its success introducing AI features that have improved performance metrics. Software stocks are expected to continue to outperform as they improve AI models and develop new applications. They could also benefit from their relative insulation from trade uncertainty, which dented the overall stock market’s returns in the first half. AI infrastructure, a theme that outperformed for most of 2024, continued to be a winner on Wall Street in the first half of this year. Tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (GOOG), and Meta looked through economic uncertainty and stood by plans to cumulatively spend hundreds of billions of dollars on property, buildings, and equipment this year. Much of that spending is earmarked for the technology required to develop and run advanced AI, like Nvidia chips, Super Micro Computer (SMCI) servers, and Amphenol (APH) fiber optic cables. Those hardware suppliers saw their shares rise 18%, 61%, and 42%, respectively, in the first half. The buildout of power-hungry data centers boosted the stocks of nuclear power providers, whose electricity is in demand from tech companies who say they are looking to shrink their carbon footprints. Shares of Constellation Energy (CEG) and Vistra (VST) advanced 44% and 41%, respectively. But bringing new nuclear power online is a long process, and data centers are in the meantime relying on natural gas, boosting the stocks of gas-fired plant operators like NRG Energy (NRG), up 78% year-to-date, and gas turbine makers like GE Vernova (GEV), up 61%. Experts expect the AI infrastructure trade to be resilient. Tech giants “are planning for long-term data center capacity requirements and won’t alter their investment plans based on tariff regimes that change from week to week,” said Shaon Baqui, tech equities analyst at Janus Henderson Investors. The mood globally in the first half of 2025 was tense, to put it mildly. That was good for gold. In five months, the second Trump administration launched a global trade war targeting friends and foes alike; opened questions about America's commitment to longtime alliances like NATO; increased America’s involvement in Israel’s conflict with its neighbors; and ratcheted up tensions with China. Investors who sought stability turned to gold, a time-honored safe-haven asset. Gold prices climbed to record high after record high, peaking at more than $3,450 on June 13, the day Israel launched attacks on Iran’s nuclear program. Shares of gold miner Newmont (NEM) followed prices higher, rising 56% over the first half of the year. Fellow miners Barrick (B) and Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM) advanced 34% and 52%, respectively. Central banks, wary of inflation and their reliance on U.S.-controlled reserve assets, have been major buyers of gold in recent years. Demand for gold is expected to remain high for the foreseeable future as governments around the world seek to hedge against elevated geopolitical tensions and an uncertain global economic outlook. The World Gold Council’s most recent Central Bank Gold Reserves survey found that nearly all central banks expect global gold reserves to increase over the next 12 months. A record 43% of respondents said they plan to add to their gold holdings over the same period.

Title: Meta stock hits a record high as Mark Zuckerberg reveals poached new recruits from OpenAI, Anthropic and Google

Beatrice Nolan is a London-based reporter at Fortune covering tech. Meta stock hit an all-time high on Monday following the news that CEO Mark Zuckerberg had recruited an all-star Superintelligence team that includes key architects of ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and its image-gen tech. The company’s stock peaked at $747.90 during Monday trading, beating Meta’s previous record set in February this year. Shares closed Monday at a record $738.09, marking a 23% year-to-date gain. Investors cheered the company’s aggressive push into AI and its hiring spree of talent from major rivals in the space, including OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. Meta’s new Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang posted the list of new recruits on X. Wang recently joined the company as part of a deal that saw Meta investing up to $15 billion for a 49% stake in his training data company, ScaleAI. Zuckerberg reportedly told staff that former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman will co-lead the group with Wang. “I’m excited to be the Chief AI Officer, working alongside [Nat Friedman],” he wrote in a post. “We also have several strong new team members joining today or who have joined in the past few weeks that I’m excited to share as well.” The team includes several prominent former OpenAI researchers, including: Representatives for OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fortune, made outside normal working hours. Zuckerberg has reportedly been personally recruiting for Meta’s new 50-person “Superintelligence” AI team, reportedly offering $100m signing bonuses to woo top OpenAI researchers, according to CEO Sam Altman. OpenAI is reportedly scrambling to contain the fallout after a wave of high-profile researcher departures to Meta, with Chief Research Officer Mark Chen likening the exodus to a home invasion. In a memo obtained by Wired, Chen told employees that OpenAI’s leadership team, including Altman, had been working “around the clock” to retain the company’s top talent, urgently recalibrating compensation and seeking “creative” ways to reward top performers. While Altman publicly complained about rumored $100 million signing bonuses, Meta has internally disputed the figure. In a recent all-hands meeting shared with The Verge, Meta’s CTO Andrew Bosworth said the actual offers Meta was making were more complicated and implied that only a few very senior people may have been offered that kind of money. He clarified that “the actual terms of the offer” weren’t just “sign-on bonus” but rather “all these different things.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Seagate Stock To $85?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/07/01/seagate-stock-to-85/
Time Published: 2025-07-01T10:30:15Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/05/07: In this photo illustration, the Seagate Technology logo is seen displayed on a ... More smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Question: How would you respond if you owned Seagate (NASDAQ: STX) and its value plummeted by 60% or more in the upcoming months? While this may seem extreme, it is not without precedent. Seagate's stock has experienced such severe declines previously, and based on its current valuation, history might repeat itself. Up to this point in 2025, Seagate has achieved an impressive 65% return year-to-date, significantly exceeding the S&P 500’s 5% increase. This rise has been driven by structural improvements in the company and a timely shift towards next-gen technologies like HAMR (Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording). Seagate is currently benefiting from a upswing in the data-storage market, which is being bolstered by the increasing demand for generative AI and cloud infrastructure. However, behind the AI enthusiasm and operational improvements lies a more cautionary narrative. Separately see, What’s Next For Nike Stock? Here’s the point: The main takeaway is that during a downturn, Seagate stock could suffer considerable losses. Data from 2020 shows that STX stock lost around 35% of its value within just a few quarters, experiencing a peak-to-trough drop of about 58% during the 2022 inflation crisis, underperforming significantly compared to the S&P 500. This raises the question: Could the stock see a sell-off and potentially fall to $85 if a similar scenario were to occur? As a rule, individual stocks tend to be more volatile than diversified portfolios. Consequently, if you seek growth with decreased volatility, you might want to investigate the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and yielded returns over 91% since its launch. Seagate produces high-capacity HDDs (hard disk drives)—essential infrastructure for storing the immense datasets necessary for training and deploying large language models (LLMs). While SSDs (solid-state drives) are the go-to choice for fast-access storage, HDDs remain dominant in cold storage and hyperscale cloud archives—key applications for companies such as Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon. Seagate introduced its Mozaic 3+ platform last year, which achieves 3 TB per platter through HAMR technology and incorporates it into its Exos 30 TB+ drives, which have already begun shipping to hyperscale cloud clients. At its June 2025 investor conference, Seagate announced that engineering samples of 40 TB HAMR drives (10×4 TB platters) have already been delivered, with mass production anticipated in the first half of FY 2026. The company intends to launch Mozaic 4+ with 40 TB+ capacity in 2026, followed by Mozaic 5+ providing 50 TB+ drives by 2028, and is aiming for 100 TB HDDs by 2030 as part of its larger HAMR roadmap. While this technological advancement positions Seagate for long-term growth, it also introduces execution risks if demand does not scale as expected. Seagate forecasts Q4 adjusted EPS (June fiscal year) to be between $2.20 and $2.60, with revenue expected between $2.25–$2.55 billion. Consensus is predicting 38% revenue growth in FY 2025 and 13% in FY 2026. Nevertheless, even solid growth expectations cannot safeguard the stock from macroeconomic shocks, valuation declines, or operational setbacks. With very little margin for error, any misstep could lead to a steep correction. STX stock has performed worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during several recent downturns. While investors remain hopeful for a soft landing for the U.S. economy, how severe could it get if another recession occurs? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash illustrates how key stocks performed during and after the last six market crashes. • STX stock decreased 58.2% from a high of $116.02 on 4 January 2022 to $48.49 on 3 November 2022, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 27 May 2025 • Since then, the stock has risen to a high of $141.44 on 29 June 2025 • STX stock fell 35.6% from a high of $63.23 on 24 January 2020 to $40.73 on 20 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 4 December 2020 • STX stock dropped 89.1% from a high of $28.60 on 2 November 2007 to $3.11 on 23 January 2009, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 18 April 2012 Currently, Seagate trades at 18x consensus 2025 earnings, significantly above its three-year average of only 5x. Its price-to-sales ratio has escalated to 3x, rising from 1.2x in FY 2022. Even its forward P/S of 3x surpasses the three-year average of 2.8x. In comparison, Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC), a direct competitor, typically trades around 1x P/S during market downturns. Investor confidence is evidently reflected in the stock’s elevated valuation—but with greater height comes a steeper potential fall. The average analyst price target of $125 suggests an 11% downside, even without factoring in a market correction. Considering the wider economic uncertainties, ask yourself this: Do you plan to hold onto your Seagate stock now, or will you panic and sell if it starts to drop to $100, $90, or even lower? Hanging onto a declining stock is never an easy task. Trefis partners with Empirical Asset Management—an investment firm in the Boston area—whose asset allocation strategies produced positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P lost over 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio into its asset allocation framework to offer clients better returns and less risk compared to the benchmark index—a smoother journey, as evidenced in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

ByRobert Barone ByRobert Barone, Contributor. On Friday (June 27th), both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed at record levels. This occurred despite growing evidence of a slowing economy and continued trade angst.1 Meanwhile, the DJIA is still -2.65% away from its 12/4/24 peak (45,014.04) and the small cap Russell 2000 remains off more than -11% from its 11/25/24 high (2,442.03).2 This isn’t a surprise to us as the industrial economy and especially small caps always feel an economic slowdown before it becomes mainstream. In addition, the DJIA and Russell 2000 have many fewer tech companies, the sector where the action is. The consolidated reporting charts are for informational purposes only and should not replace the ... More official reporting made available by each index, custodian, market and/or security. The table above shows that all the major indexes had a good week and month. For the year, the S&P 500 is up about 5% (about where is should be halfway through a typical 10% growth year), while the other three major indexes are lagging. The Nasdaq is up less than 1% while the DJIA (industrials) and the Russell 2000 (small cap) are underwater year to date (with the Russell 2000 off more than -5%). So, a mixed bag.1 2 Five of the Magnificent 7 (NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, META and GOOG) enjoyed a prosperous week. AAPL and TSLA were marginally positive. For the year to date, it is really a mixed bag. AAPL and TSLA are down nearly -20%, and GOOG is down more than -6%. Meanwhile META, NVDA and MSFT show substantial gains, while AMZN is just keeping its head above water. Nevertheless, on Friday, NVDA closed at a new record high.3 4 The consolidated reporting charts are for informational purposes only and should not replace the ... More official reporting made available by each index, custodian, market and/or security. The Consumer As the consumer goes, so goes the economy. So, when the consumers’ income falls, or inflation rises faster than that income, real consumption growth is negatively impacted. So, it isn’t good news to learn that personal earnings (excluding government transfers) fell in May (-0.1%) and have been negative in three of the past four months. Perhaps this is responsible for the -0.1% drop in consumer spending in May which, after including the effects of inflation, amounts to -0.3% in real terms. There was a fall in spending on durable goods of -1.8%, -0.3% for non-durables, and services were essentially flat (-0.03%).5 There are other signs of consumer discomfort. One such sign is the rise in the number of multiple job holders. This occurs when the income from a single job isn’t sufficient to maintain that worker’s lifestyle. Either live at a lower level or get a second job! The chart shows a steady upward trend in this statistic since the pandemic.6 Bureau of Labor Statistics Other such signs can be seen in the delinquency rates on consumer loans. Delinquencies on mortgages, auto loans and consumer credit are on the rise. The left-hand side of the chart below shows that credit card balances are at record levels as consumers try to maintain their standard of living (Charge it now – worry about paying for it later!). Note the rapid rise in delinquencies (right-hand side of the chart below) in the post-pandemic period. Note that while credit card delinquencies of 90+ days appear to have come down recently, this is most likely due to increased write-offs of such debt by the financial (bank) system.7 8 FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel, Equifax, Bloomberg Finally, a look at the major retailer reports reinforces the aggregate data. Best Buy, for example, recently cut its sales forecast for 2025. Kohl’s reported -3.9% sales growth in Q1, and went on to forecast -5% to -7% for 2025 as a whole. Foot Locker reported that sales fell -2.6% from year earlier levels, and Hormel trimmed its earnings outlook.5Housing As always, housing is a good indicator of the economy’s economic health. The left-hand side of the chart below shows the slowdown in Existing Home Sales over the past couple of years, and the right-hand side indicates the rapid rise in the months’ supply of inventory at current sales rates (now higher than the pandemic peak). This is a sign of growing weakness and inevitably leads to a slowdown in new home construction with spillover effects into the labor market. National Association of Realtors and Bureau of Labor Statistics Note in the New Home Sales chart below the horizontal trend since 2023 and the latest turndown in 2025. U.S. Census Bureau As demand stagnates, so do home prices. As seen from the chart below, the median sales price of new homes has stagnated for the past two years. Final Thoughts Equity markets continued their upward path the week ended June 27th with record highs for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. It was a good week and a good month for stocks. But this rising tide has put the P/E ratio significantly above its long-term mean. Investors beware! For 2025, the S&P 500 leads the pack, up nearly 5%, while small-caps also carry a “5” growth number, but with a negative sign.1 2 It was also a positive week for all of the Magnificent 7 (AAPL barely so). Year-to-date, the stock prices of four of the Mag 7 are positive and three are negative, with AAPL and TSLA each down nearly -20%!3 4 As the consumer goes, so does the economy. One can see the stress developing in the consumer sector by looking at the rising trend of multiple job holders and the rise in both credit card balances and 90+ day delinquencies.6 7 8 Housing is always a bellwether of the economy. The fact that Existing Home Sales have tanked and New Home Sales have flatlined tells an astute observer that the economy has entered rocky ground.

Title: Coffee Break: OpenAI as The Money Pit

OpenAI has fatally flawed finances which reveal a company that presents no serious threat to any of the tech incumbents, including Google. In the (excellent) comments to my post last Monday on Google’s inexplicable-to-me decision to risk their search monopoly by going all-in on LLM AI one from Hickory exposed that I had failed to make a key point: ChatGPT is not a threat to replace Google as the leader in search because OpenAI loses money on every ChatGPT prompt and is trying to make it up in volume. Let’s put aside the claims about LLMs having reasoning ability for now and focus on the bullish business case for ChatGPT as a killer app that threatens Google search. Cal Newport lays out that case: The application that has… leaped ahead to become the most exciting and popular use of these tools is smart search. If you have a question, instead of turning to Google you can query a new version of ChatGPT or Claude. These models can search the web to gather information, but unlike a traditional search engine, they can also process the information they find and summarize for you only what you care about. Want the information presented in a particular format, like a spreadsheet or a chart? A high-end model like GPT-4o can do this for you as well, saving even more extra steps. Smart search has become the first killer app of the generative AI era because, like any good killer app, it takes an activity most people already do all the time — typing search queries into web sites — and provides a substantially, almost magically better experience. This feels similar to electronic spreadsheets conquering paper ledger books or email immediately replacing voice mail and fax. I would estimate that around 90% of the examples I see online right now from people exclaiming over the potential of AI are people conducting smart searches. This behavioral shift is appearing in the data. A recent survey conducted by Future found that 27% of US-based respondents had used AI tools such as ChatGPT instead of a traditional search engine. From an economic perspective, this shift matters. Earlier this month, the stock price for Alphabet, the parent company for Google, fell after an Apple executive revealed that Google searches through the Safari web browser had decreased over the previous two months, likely due to the increased use of AI tools. Keep in mind, web search is a massive business, with Google earning over $175 billion from search ads in 2023 alone. In my opinion, becoming the new Google Search is likely the best bet for a company like OpenAI to achieve profitability… That’s a seemingly reasonable claim, but doesn’t hold up after a look into OpenAI’s business plans for ChatGPT. Despite their seeming threat to Google search, OpenAI is the kind of self-defeating competition no monopolist should fear, much less destroy its proven business model to compete with. The New York Times put it pretty well last September: pic.twitter.com/As1hKPAqtB — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) June 30, 2025 Morningstar summed up the NYT’s reporting well: Financial documents reviewed by The New York Times reveal a company burning through cash at an alarming rate, raising questions about the sustainability of its current trajectory and the potential risks of prioritizing break-neck expansion over responsible AI development. Let’s discuss some of the key points from the New York Times report, which was published last week before the funding announcement: — OpenAI’s monthly revenue hit $300 million in August 2024, a 1,700% increase since early 2023. — The company expects to generate around $3.7 billion in annual sales this year and anticipates revenue ballooning to $11.6 billion in 2025. — Despite rising revenues, OpenAI predicts a loss of about $5 billion. this year due to high operational costs, biggest of which is the cost of computing power it gets through its partnership with Microsoft. — OpenAI predicts its revenue will hit $100 billion in 2029. The Times report raises serious questions about OpenAI’s sustainability and realistic goals. The company’s monthly revenue growth from early 2023 to August 2024 is nothing short of explosive; however, the long-term projection of $100 billion in revenue by 2029 appears unrealistic. This figure would require sustaining an average annual growth rate of more than 90% for five consecutive years (93.3% to be precise, from an expected $3.7 billion in 2024 to $100 billion in 2029), a feat rarely achieved in the tech industry, especially for a company already operating at such a large scale. While impressive on paper, said projections may be masking underlying financial challenges and setting expectations that could be difficult, if not impossible, to meet. Financial challenges become even more apparent given the current expense structure in relation to projected growth. It’s crucial to note that, even if it reaches the projected revenue targets, OpenAI is not merely failing to break even in 2024 – it’s losing significantly more money than it’s generating. This means that before OpenAI can even consider achieving its ambitious growth targets, it must first find a way to become profitable, or at the very least, break even. Bryan McMahon pointed out the massive financial risk posed by the stock market bubble driven by faith in LLMs or as he calls it Generative AI: Venture capital (VC) funds, drunk on a decade of “growth at all costs,” have poured about $200 billion into generative AI. Making matters worse, the stock market’s bull run is deeply dependent on the growth of the Big Tech companies fueling the AI bubble. In 2023, 71 percent of the total gains in the S&P 500 were attributable to the “Magnificent Seven”—Apple, Nvidia, Tesla, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft—all of which are among the biggest spenders on AI. Just four—Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta—combined for $246 billion of capital expenditure in 2024 to support the AI build-out. Goldman Sachs expects Big Tech to spend over $1 trillion on chips and data centers to power AI over the next five years. Yet OpenAI, the current market leader, expects to lose $5 billion this year, and its annual losses to swell to $11 billion by 2026. If the AI bubble bursts, it not only threatens to wipe out VC firms in the Valley but also blow a gaping hole in the public markets and cause an economy-wide meltdown. But wait it gets worse, per Ed Zitron: It seems, from even a cursory glance, that OpenAI’s costs are increasing dramatically. The Information reported earlier in the year that OpenAI projects to spend $13 billion on compute with Microsoft alone in 2025, nearly tripling what it spent in total on compute in 2024 ($5 billion). This suggests that OpenAI’s costs are skyrocketing, and that was before the launch of its new image generator which led to multiple complaints from Altman about a lack of available GPUs, leading to OpenAI’s CEO saying to expect “stuff to break” and delays in new products. Nevertheless, even if we assume OpenAI factored in the compute increases into its projections, it still expects to pay Microsoft $13 billion for compute this year. This number, however, doesn’t include the $12.9 billion five-year-long compute deal signed with CoreWeave, a deal that was a result of Microsoft declining to pick up the option to buy said compute itself. Payments for this deal, according to The Information, start in October 2025, and assuming that it’s evenly paid (the terms of these contracts are generally secret, even in the case of public companies), this would still amount to roughly $2.38 billion a year. I’ll let the Entertainment Strategy Guy nail the profitability coffin shut: By all accounts, right now, OpenAI is losing money. Like literally billions of dollars. The energy costs of LLMs are enormous. If they’re pricing their services below market value, trying to gain market share, then we don’t know if AI can make money for the service it’s providing right now. Two factors are driving these costs. First, the memory an AI program uses (either the more data it stores as it thinks or the longer it thinks about a problem/answer), the more it costs the AI companies in compute. Second, the AI companies are racing to build next-generation models that will require even more training, which means higher costs. And the salaries for top AI engineers/scientists are also sky-rocketing up. This is why I’m somewhat skeptical about the sorts of things that OpenAI is promising that AI can do (like become your universal assistant that remembers everything about you); it seems like an absolute memory boondoggle of monumental proportions. How much energy will it take for AI to analyze my whole life if it’s already too taxing for an LLM to remember how to format links properly? But wait, there’s even more bad news that just dropped. OpenAI is now in a bidding war for talent with some of the stupidest money out there, Mark Zuckerberg of Meta: …competition for top AI researchers is heating up in Silicon Valley. Zuckerberg has been particularly aggressive in his approach, offering $100 million signing bonuses to some OpenAI staffers, according to comments Altman made on a podcast with his brother, Jack Altman. Multiple sources at OpenAI with direct knowledge of the offers confirmed the number. The Meta CEO has also been personally reaching out to potential recruits, according to the Wall Street Journal. “Over the past month, Meta has been aggressively building out their new AI effort, and has repeatedly (and mostly unsuccessfully) tried to recruit some of our strongest talent with comp-focused packages,” Chen wrote on Slack. And speaking of dumb money and OpenAI, Softbank is involved, although maybe not as much as reported: (In April) OpenAI closed “the largest private tech funding round in history,” where it “raised” an astonishing “$40 billion,” and the reason that I’ve put quotation marks around it is that OpenAI has only raised $10 billion of the $40 billion, with the rest arriving by “the end of the year.” The remaining $30 billion — $20 billion of which will (allegedly) be provided by SoftBank — is partially contingent on OpenAI’s conversion from a non-profit to a for-profit by the end of 2025, and if it fails, SoftBank will only give OpenAI a further $20 billion. The round also valued OpenAI at $300 billion. And things might not be going so well with Softbank because OpenAI is now talking to even dumber, and much more dangerous, money: Saudi Arabia. And if you’ve ever paid attention to the actual words coming out of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s mouth, you’ll realize Altman attracting dumb money is just a case of birds of a feather flocking together. Ed Zitron chronicles some of the stupid in his latest newsletter: Here is but one of the trenchant insights from Sam Altman in his agonizing 37-minute-long podcast conversation with his brother Jack Altman from last week: “I think there will be incredible other products. There will be crazy new social experiences. There will be, like, Google Docs style AI workflows that are just way more productive. You’ll start to see, you’ll have these virtual employees, but the thing that I think will be most impactful on that five to ten year timeframe is AI will actually discover new science.” When asked why he believes AI will “discover new science,” Altman says that “I think we’ve cracked reasoning in the models,” adding that “we’ve a long way to go,” and that he “think[s] we know what to do,” adding that OpenAI’s o3 model “is already pretty smart,” and that he’s heard people say “wow, this is like a good PHD.” That’s the entire answer! It’s complete nonsense! Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, a company allegedly worth $300 billion to venture capitalists and SoftBank, kind of sounds like a huge idiot! Ed also roasts Alphabet/Google’s Sundar Pichai: Sundar Pichai, when asked one of Nilay Patel’s patented 100-word-plus-questions about Jony Ive and Sam Altman’s new (and likely heavily delayed) hardware startup: I think AI is going to be bigger than the internet. There are going to be companies, products, and categories created that we aren’t aware of today. I think the future looks exciting. I think there’s a lot of opportunity to innovate around hardware form factors at this moment with this platform shift. I’m looking forward to seeing what they do. We are going to be doing a lot as well. I think it’s an exciting time to be a consumer, it’s an exciting time to be a developer. I’m looking forward to it. The fuck are you on about, Sundar? Your answer to a question about whether you anticipate more competition is to say “yeah I think people are gonna make shit we haven’t come up with and uhh, hardware, can’t wait!” While I think Pichai is likely a little smarter than Altman, in the same way that Satya Nadella is a little smarter than Pichai, and in the same way that a golden retriever is smarter than a chihuahua. That said, none of these men are superintelligences, nor, when pressed, do they ever seem to have any actual answers. If ChatGPT were such an existential threat to Google’s search monopoly that Alphabet’s only option was risking the empire to beat OpenAI in the LLM race, it would be profitable or at least have a plausible path to profitability. Sam Altman being a blithering idiot isn’t really the disadvantage it should be since he’s going up against competition like Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Sundar Pichai. This isn’t like Uber vs. the local taxi incumbents in the 2010s where despite Uber’s never going to be profitable business model they were able to take over in many markets because OpenAI does not have a huge cash advantage over Alphabet and never will. Next week we’ll look at at Meta, the absolute stupidest tech money around — a company that put Dana White of the Ultimate Fighting Championship on its board. And because I promised I’d get around to this, regarding LLMs ability to “reason” it was thoroughly debunked last October by six researchers from Apple in a paper called “GSM-Symbolic: Understanding the Limitations of Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models.” When the paper was released the senior author, Mehrdad Farajtabar, tweeted that, ““we found no evidence of formal reasoning in language models …. Their behavior is better explained by sophisticated pattern matching—so fragile, in fact, that changing names can alter results by ~10%!” Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. One of the Ed Zitron pieces you cited: https://www.wheresyoured.at/openai-is-a-systemic-risk-to-the-tech-industry-2/ while quite long, goes deep into the details of OpenAI’s present and future financing and how they expect to meet their financial commitments over the next two or three years. It left me in a funk for several days, not because I care a whit about OpenAI, but because the business press has now apparently become so delusional and dishonest that it’s hard to believe anything or even see how things can go on. After reading this, I have to conclude that OpenAI/Softbank is definitely, positively going to go out of business in the next two or three years. How much of the rest of the economy they take down with it is perhaps more worrisome. This is the same business press that covered Uber and Lyft breathlessly for 15 years as Uber burnt through money.. because they wanted the businesses to succeed. The will do the same thing with OpenAI until they magically find profit. Kurtismayfield, yea but I don’t think the overall economy has the runway that Uber had in the 2010s. Gonna be some reality checks sooner rather than later. Yea, the LLM bubble popping might be the end of the “Everything Bubble” that George Soros wrote a whole book about 20 years ago As a complement to this piece, I recommend this lengthy interview with technology journalist Karen Hao about her recent book “Empire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares in Sam Altman’s OpenAI”. thanks! I will check it out. Agreed. It was excellent. I’m not so sure that taking over search or even making money are the real goals of these people. We had a story in Links today about LLMs ability to ensnare the lonely or unhappy into “relationships” that seem quite real to the victims. That could prove a handy tool if you’re a tech billionaire trying to take over the world or even a government seeking to disable potential dissidents. One emerging dystopia is a world where tech billionaires use AIs to battle each other for world control. The LLMs would be useful for “converting” people to their cause, while another type of AI could control huge drone swarms that attack opponents’ data centers. Philip K. Dick could make a fun novel out of that possibility. excellent point. I’m always missing the story because I’m busy arguing the rational explanation. Like trying to evaluate today’s stonk market based on business fundamentals or betting on professional wrestling based on the athleticism of the performers. LLM’s ability to persuade might indeed be the killer app. What dark magick! That is in fact VULCAN’S HAMMER from 1959, or damned close to it, IIRC. It’s almost universally agreed to be Dick’s worst novel, for completions only. but Dick’s visionary abilities make even his least essential work of interest. It certainly wasn’t his mastery of prose. Apologies, I read the post before I saw your comment which I duplicated below. Karen Hao has substantial insights into the broader questions. “Second, the AI companies are racing to build next-generation models that will require even more training, which means higher costs.” “Training” Data mining that amounts to wealth transfers and even more opportunities for surveillance and control of the flow of information are going to be the main outcome. Yea Gary Marcus is saying surveillance is where OpenAI is headed, I’ll get into that in a future post although even there Palintir is way ahead of them and is infamously using AI widely in Gaza and everywhere else. There is a lot to be said for local inference. “Fast” and “easy” are not usually among them. I will say that the installation process is slowly getting easier for the suitably equipped general user, month by month. Consider also the possibility of OpenAI or other chatbot providers being a regulatory arbitrage bid with broader ambitions, sort of like Uber. The anti-AI partisans, supplied with scary developments by researchers, are helping create the conditions for the enclosure of local private computation, with the economic and surveillance effects you’d imagine. The “Singapore Consensus on Global AI Safety Research Priorities” only hints at this eventuality. It does speak plainly to the general desire for surveillance among the participants, and utters some other uncomfortably guild-like noises. yikes. It’s easy to dismiss some of the “OMG AI is totes going to take over the world” crap as the opposite side of the coin of the hype but you’re right. There are a lot of very scary possibilities being worked toward even as the business idiots defraud believers for billions. Of course that’s scary too as they’re risking yet another financial collapse. I love dooming with this community! Everyone here is smarter than me and I’m learning a ton in these comment sections. Such a pleasant change from the various ridiculous and highly toxic electorates, “targets” and fandoms I’ve been writing for these last 28 years. To see where all this AI stuff may be headed, a viewing of “Forbidden Planet” might be predictive. Their version ruined it’s creators, the Krell,. I haven’t seen that since I was a kid and I didn’t have a clue what it was about. will give it a shot now Seconded. Not only is it a beautiful movie with stunning hand-painted sets, credible spacecraft and a great robot, but also the issues it addresses are more relevant now than when the movie was made. Human hubris and the human subconscious make for a dangerous pairing. Transhumanist dreams become nightmares. And Anne Francis is smokin’ hot. ok then, my friend’s documentary is going to have to wait As a complete ignoramus in these matters, I have long assumed the most likely financiers of AI are going to to be the US and Chinese militaries. I imagine no self-respecting general is going to want to fight a war of the future without feeling he has the superior AI. Am I missing something? Palintir has certainly used AI as a “killer app” in Gaza. But I don’t know much about what type of AI — if it’s machine learning or LLMs or what. I suspect it’s some of all types. No intelligent general would depend on AI because LLM based AIs are always very convincing but one out of three times they are flat out wrong. These mistakes are sometimes called “hallucinations.” I was not thinking of LLMs, but other forms of AI. Palantir and the IDF don’t care about hallucinations or wrong data, they don’t view their targets as human so they don’t care if they get a few extra victims while they’re targeting a doctor or journalist’s family for a synchronized multi-site assassination. for genocidal purposes hallucinations are a feature, not a bug “one out of three times they are flat out wrong.” Seems like better results than those delivered by our present intelligence agencies (the surveillance and control bureaucracies). So we can guarantee about 100% of generals will buy into it. Especially once a the hint of post military career board positions are offered. A young man our family knew when he was a high school student in Ljubljana desperate to come to America and work on AI now, nearly 20 years later, has a Silicon Valley start-up working on voice recognition and mimicry. Wonder who’s interested in that. all kinds of fun people, I’m sure. From MI6 to the Sinaloa Cartel… I think you are right for two reasons: 1. Drones with target matching that can take over in case of broken communication would make one main anti-drone defence on the battlefield in Ukraine much less useful. (Machine learning, not a chatbot) 2. Accountability sink. When the need comes to massacre civilians or POWs, it’s useful if the machine kills and can be blamed. Also it saves on PTSD treatment for the soldiers. See Gaza. Don’t know the business aspects, but ISTM that building the models and running the models are two different things. I have a couple of open source Hugging Face-type models here locally that I run in the open source Python environment on NVidia cuda with 6 Gb VRAM, though you need 12 or even 18 Gb to really be productive. As far as online, I’ve found I’m using Google-AI from their search where I might have used Stack Overflow in the past for simple programming solutions. Don’t see any monetization opportunities for Google from my usage. On a large open source project I work on, one dev has a MS CoPilot account and runs all the commits through it prior to merging. I don’t see any earth-shaking insights from it but it does in the main offer useful ideas. You haven’t seen CoPilot producing hallucinations? Oddly, I’ve found for basic Python, OpenAI’s Codex and its GitHub integration work surprisingly well. It’s still clearly a very early product and you can’t for example independently push to a PR branch and get Codex to update its working branch, but whatever. I was only using it for pretty straightforward personal things. Some of us are so old we can remember twenty five years ago when the web was considered a libertarian alternative to traditional media and the open source movement an ultimate expression of this. I still regard it that way and about half my searches go to information aggregator Wikipedia which is produced by humans if not always trustworthy humans. But whatever it’s flaws, I’d say Wiki is a lot more trustworthy than a money making robot run by investor sharks. If AI isn’t about surveillance then what else could this impractical technology possibly be about? True, from the above, it sounds like it is merely about suckering stock buyers. Balzac said behind every great fortune is a great crime and then W.C. Fields said you can’t cheat an honest man. Welcome to our world. Wiki (and Reddit) has been heavily manipulated by the worst actors on Earth for decades now. See Who’s Editing Wikipedia – Diebold, the CIA, a Campaign — Wired 2007 There’s also the rumor that Ghislaine Maxwell was a huge moderator on Reddit which has never been confirmed, but this Vice article “debunking” it has many of the tropes of other “debunkings” (see Vox.com’s 2020 covid coverage, the suppression of the NY Post’s 2020 election eve Hunter Biden laptop story or MSNBC on Russiagate to this day). Use of terms like “incoherent and evidence-free conspiracy theory”, “The ‘evidence’ shared by conspiracy theorists”….sets off alerts in the part of my brain that triggers PTSD when the phrase “unprovoked invasion of Ukraine” is encountered. Counterpoint, the theory was pushed hard by this Utah MAGA Senate candidate who at a glance is walking the anti-Zionist/anti-Semite line a little to closely for my comfort. Like others I don’t get much out of Reddit. And of course we all know about how Wales is not to be trusted and how Wikipedia is manipulated by the spooks. But also of course there are countless topics on Wikipedia that have nothing to do with the spooks. Everything is manipulated now to some degree but some formats are less susceptible than others. Walter Cronkite once said he picked all the stories for the evening news from that day’s NY Times. Now the Times is a joke https://www.moonofalabama.org/2025/06/nyt-guessing-about-iran-with-experts-who-lack-knowledge-of-it.html and we webians have to become our own gatekeepers and editors rather than rely on that dubious “first draft of history” (which I too once read avidly). Computers are a tool. You control them or they control you. my difficulty is dealing with normies who don’t become their own gatekeepers. watching the democrats go blue maga in the 2016-2024 era was pretty awful since that was my closest family and friends my GOP family and friends were always at a bit of an arm’s remove, cousins not siblings I think you’ll find the full-fat version is “Vladimir Putin’s brutal, unprovoked invasion of Ukraine”. Extra points for later references to Putin’s Chef, Putin’s Banker, Putin’s Thinker and other variations on his imagined menagerie of stock villain characters. Karen Hao, in an interview with Novara Media UK offers substantial information on the AI situation. Silicon Valley Insider Exposes Cult Like AI Companies As Artificial Intelligence begins to fundamentally alter the way normal people live their lives, it’s often talked about in terms of boom and doom, which makes a nuanced examination difficult. The problem with AI is that the understanding required to scrutinise the technology is rare and even if one does have that understanding, the ability to clearly communicate it is even rarer. This week’s guest has been both a worker in, and reporter on the tech industry and is uniquely poised to present a nuanced and informed analysis of this rapidly expanding industry. In her new book, ‘Empire of AI’, Karen Hao debunks myths that surround AI and exposes us to the full breadth of this global industry, from it’s cult-leader like CEOs to the workers that power the technology. She sat down with Aaron to talk about Sam Altman’s origin story, the traumatising nature of content moderation work and the striking similarities between Open AI and the British East India Company. IMO there is a case for LLMs becoming profitable but it involves injecting ads/propaganda directly into the answers. I’m sure companies and governments would pay large amounts of money to make sure that a model is biased in a way that directly benefits them. Of course, it requires getting to the point where people don’t have any alternatives to go back to. This makes Google’s destruction of the open web make sense on multiple levels The Sam Altman and Sundar Pichai quotes reminded me of this NewsRadio clip from the 90s: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lE1bS-Mn2Mk It would be funny if they weren’t running some of the biggest and most powerful companies in the world. I mean it’s easy to beat Google search these days because it’s been completely enshittified. I use Kagi – paying $100/year but I will never get a single ad. It’s like Google when Google was actually good. Well worth it. I’m doing the same, although on the monthly plan and never switched to annual. Worth noting unlike Neeva, Kagi doesn’t spider itself and just uses feeds from Google, Microsoft Bing, and a few others I think. Nonetheless, not being the product is worth paying $10 a month for. The specific survival of OpenAI isn’t of any particular interest to me personally, but DeepThink’s achievement of a 30x improvement in cost for training an effective model showed that the link between performance improvement and cost for such a new technology is not something that should be projected forward with any confidence. Whether that will save OpenAI itself, again, to me, who cares, but it seems likely to be relevant to the future ubiquity of the technology itself. DeepThink or DeepSeek? DeepSeek! Thank you Just clarifying because they’re very different animals. Very hard to tell how much of the claims made by DeepSeek are true. There is a true fog of propaganda war over that topic at the moment. It seems likely they did achieve significant efficiencies. It also seems entirely plausible that they did take advantage of OpenAI and others’ training data so it might not be replicable. This was my first thought. Just because chatgpt is unprofitable and expensive to operate now doesn’t mean that’s baked in to LLMs or “AI”. anyone who wants to evaluate whether it is wise for google to adopt LLMs in search needs to look at best-in-class in terms of cost like deepseek. Someone recently said the cost of AI converges to the cost of electricity over time. Deepseek’s improvements likely will be adopted by google eventually. What does the profitability look like at this point? I agree with many of the points in this article, but pointing out chatgpt’s unprofitability isn’t convincing. It’s very early stages and Chinese firms clearly show there’s massive room for cost savings. I saw one estimate that deepseek query costs are 3% of Chatgpt’s, so I think google’s decision should be judged with that future efficiency rate. also, whether or not chatgpt is a threat to google isn’t the issue. It’s whether LLMs and related ai tech is a threat, especially with 97% reduced query costs, and I think the answer is obviously yes. Natural language queries and responses are far more intuitive for most users and use cases than inputting a phrase and browsing links. Compare with asking “where is the nearest home depot” and being given the answer. It would be good to be skeptical of the reported cost advantages of Deepseek. I looked at it for my applications, which relate to cyber security for industrial control systems, and I was astounded by its ability to “reason.” (I’m going to sidestep here why I put quotes around “reason,” except to say the capability is valuable, even if it is not what humans do.) Back in February, my firm expectation was that every other engine would acquire the same reasoning capabilities within weeks or months. The fact that they have come nowhere close is suggestive that the cost advantages of Deepseek are not what they were claimed to be. A chunk of LLM API requests get redirected from places where money is real to OpenAI where the charges are on the order of 1/6 the price. Setting up your own compute to run your own models locally is pretty pricey, so if OpenAI craters it’s going to cause some pain in certain products currently subsidized by the magic of Silicon Valley. built in lack of resilience to the industry. OpenAI collapsing could be a singularity that pulls a lot of peripheral companies down into a black hole with it. “oops not the singularity we promised, does a minsky moment count?” Great post this and reading it, I can see a future direction that they will go in. That they will want the user to talk to the AI instead of just hammering on keys. That, come to think of it, was featured in the 2013 film “Her” which had a computer AI- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_(2013_film)#Plot They say that they want more training sets to make their AI better but where will those come from? They have ransacked the internet now and slurped it all up. They haven’t even set up standards for AI yet and we are still in the bananas stage- https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/27/bofh_2025_episode_12/ that’s one of the reasons Gary Marcus has known all along that the mass compute/big money/big scale approach wouldn’t work. they’re out of content to train on and the more the LLM generated content gets mixed in the worse the output gets There is lots of content left to train on. But it isn’t openly accessible stuff. Think of all the NHS data palantir will now get it’s hands on. All the data that various governments store. All the data corporations store. Hell even think about all the messages that get sent in Whatsapp and similar every day. All of that data is out that and not currently accesible. But it will be. and private phone conversations! I suspect Palintir, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon and others are grabbing “training data” that would shock and appall even the most jaded of us Oh, the Dems love “labor,” because the honchos give them (dues) money to run their campaigns during which they mouth platitudes about “working families.” But as far as supporting actual rank and file workers, not at all. You see these union politicians like Sean Fain (yes, he is for all intents and purposes a Dem Party neoliberal politician). The Dems co-opted the unions, and deal almost exclusively with high- and medium-level hacks like Fain, who think like they do. Please do not leave off topic comments. The place for this is Links. This is called thread-jacking and is a violation of our written site Policies. And there is this: Potemkin Understanding in Large Language Models As a search engine it’s OK at best, but in other regards it’s really not very reliable. this persuading people to believe crazy nonsense might be the killer app I failed to see when I did the initial post. very scary but as someone who’s spent decades in the “get attention > attempt to persuade” field I can see where that’s a high margin business provided they can cut way way down on the compute costs and energy burn. but I’m not sure the lack of need for high quality content relates to any technical cost savings. Anyone know? People already believe crazy nonsense Who needs AI? Well per MIT Technology Review “AI can do a better job of persuading people than we do: OpenAI’s GPT-4 is much better at getting people to accept its point of view during an argument than humans are—but there’s a catch.” There is a huge market to be able to control exactly what crazy nonsense specific individuals believe. This could replace advertising completely — provided they can dramatically reduce cost and energy use. Big provisions. Re tweet that the behavior of LLMs is best explained as “sophisticated pattern matching.” I agree with that, but I think a better and more incisive way of explaining LLMs is to simply say that they are all about mimicry. They are consummate con artists. They can sound just like a doctor without knowing medicine. They can sound just like a PhD without even knowing how to reason or think. Is that some huge human achievement, that we have developed a computer program that can mimic doctors and PhDs without actually knowing anything? To me, the answer is no. It’s not much of an achievement at all to develop automated con artists. Why do we need automated con artists that sound convincing but know nothing and have no value other than how convincing they sound? Several years back i overheard a senior enginer explaining to a junior one that “the key to being s consultant isn’t knowing more than the client, it’s bullshitting them that you know more”. Perhaps AI is kust a reflection of where society has already gone. it might be an achievement along the lines of Dr Frankenstein’s. I don’t pay any attention to the AI “features” in Google search, though that’s getting more and more difficult over time, because I don’t trust it not to make stuff up. I’m surprised more people aren’t likewise leery of it. word is getting out but reptition is the most powerful form of persuasion according to some and the whole tech industry is pushing this stuff on us over and over and over and over “The energy costs of LLMs are enormous.” Amongst all their BS and hype I can’t look past the energy aspect. Where will the affordable energy come from to power all of the data centres as they store increasing amounts of data, and the more data AI has to interrogate the more it consumes energy to ‘think’ (just consumes an increasingly larger amount of energy as it learns and grows)? The more I listen to energy experts discuss energy demand and affordable clean energy (is anything really clean considering the resources we dig up to build solar/wind capture infrastructure) the more I think AI will be limited by (clean/cleanish) energy availability. Based on current trends, humans will be limited by energy availability because AI has priority. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email *

(“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) common stock between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR DOUBLEVERIFY INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On May 7, 2024, DoubleVerify released its first quarter 2024 financial results and reduced its 2024 revenue guidance, disclosing that there had been a pullback in customer spending on advertising. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $11.79, or 38.6%, to close at $18.78 per share on May 8, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on February 27, 2025, DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending. The Company also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was having a negative impact on the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $7.83, or 36%, to close at $13.90 per share on February 28, 2025. Then, on March 28, 2025, Adalytics Research, LLC published a report alleging, among other things, that DoubleVerify’s web advertisement verification and fraud protection services were ineffective and that its customers were regularly billed for ad impressions served to bots. The same day, The Wall Street Journal reported that DoubleVerify regularly missed detection of nonhuman traffic despite the Company’s claims that it helps brands avoid serving ads to nonhuman bot accounts. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (2) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (3) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (4) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (5) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (6) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (7) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired DoubleVerify securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than July 21, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Key allegations in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint against the company and certain of its officers have survived a motion to dismiss. That complaint alleges that Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC), through certain of its officers and directors, made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Napco failed to address any material weaknesses with internal controls regarding cost of goods sold ("COGS") and inventory; (2) Napco downplayed the severity of material weaknesses regarding their internal controls; (3) Napco’s unaudited financial statements from September 30, 2022 to the present included “certain errors” such as overstating inventory and understanding net COGS, resulting in overstated gross profit, operating income and net income for each period; (4) as a result, Napco would need to restate its previously filed unaudited financial statements for certain periods; and (5) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. On April 11, 2025, the federal court determined that key allegations would survive Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint. In so holding, the court determined “Plaintiffs have adequately stated Exchange Act claims by pleading scienter [knowledge of wrongdoing] through defendants’ unusual stock sales and by plausibly alleging loss causation between the corrective announcement and stock price drop. Plaintiffs have also stated Securities Act claims against Napco and the underwriter defendants.” . . . “Taking the well-pleaded facts as true, there is no question that plaintiffs have adequately pled scienter. First, the stock sales were highly unusual in timing and amount. As to amount, the total proceeds of over $108 million from stock sales by the officer defendants weigh in favor of a motive. . . . And the officer defendants sold hefty percentages of their holdings – 48.5% for Soloway and 45.5% for Buchel.” What To Do Now: If you have held Napco shares since before November 7, 2022 and would like to learn more about this matter, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H.

Full Content:
Have you ever heard Sam Altman speak? I’m serious, have you ever heard this man say words from his mouth? Here is but one of the trenchant insights from Sam Altman in his agonizing 37-minute-long podcast conversation with his brother Jack Altman from last week: When asked why he believes AI will “discover new science,” Altman says that “I think we’ve cracked reasoning in the models,” adding that “we’ve a long way to go,” and that he “think[s] we know what to do,” adding that OpenAI’s o3 model “is already pretty smart,” and that he’s heard people say “wow, this is like a good PHD.” That’s the entire answer! It’s complete nonsense! Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, a company allegedly worth $300 billion to venture capitalists and SoftBank, kind of sounds like a huge idiot! “But Ed!” you cry. “You can’t just call Sam Altman an idiot! He isn’t stupid! He runs a big company, and he’s super successful!” My counter to that is, first, yes I can, I’m doing it right now. Second, if Altman didn’t want to be called stupid, he wouldn’t say stupid shit with a straight face to a massive global audience. My favourite part of the interview is near the beginning: This is a nonsensical conversation, and both of them sound very, very stupid. “So, is this going to make new science or make science faster?” “Yeah, I hear scientists are using AI to go faster [CITATION NEEDED], but if a human scientist goes three times faster [CITATION NEEDED] using my model that would be good. Also I heard from a guy that he heard a guy who did biology who said ‘this helped.’” Phenomenal! Give this guy $40 billion or more dollars every year until he creates a superintelligence, that’ll fucking work. Here are some other incredible quotes from the genius mind of Sam Altman: This is gobbledygook, nonsense, bullshit peddled by a guy who has only the most tangential understanding of the technology his company is building. Every single interview with Sam Altman is like this, every single one, ever since he became a prominent tech investor and founder. Without fail. And the sad part is that Altman isn’t alone in this. Sundar Pichai, when asked one of Nilay Patel’s patented 100-word-plus-questions about Jony Ive and Sam Altman’s new (and likely heavily delayed) hardware startup: The fuck are you on about, Sundar? Your answer to a question about whether you anticipate more competition is to say “yeah I think people are gonna make shit we haven’t come up with and uhh, hardware, can’t wait!” While I think Pichai is likely a little smarter than Altman, in the same way that Satya Nadella is a little smarter than Pichai, and in the same way that a golden retriever is smarter than a chihuahua. That said, none of these men are superintelligences, nor, when pressed, do they ever seem to have any actual answers. Let’s see what Satya Nadella of Microsoft answered when asked about how exactly it’s going to get to (and I paraphrase Dwarkesh Patel’s mealy-mouthed question) $130 billion in AI revenue “through AGI”: This quote has been used as a means of suggesting that Nadella is saying that “generative AI is generating basically no value,” which, while somewhat true, obfuscates its true meaning: Satya Nadella isn’t saying a fucking thing. The question was “how do you get Microsoft to $130 billion in revenue,” and Satya Nadella’s answer was to say “uhhh, abundance, uhhh, explosion, uhhhhh, GDP! Growth! Industrial revolution! Inflation-adjusted! Percentages! The winners will be the people who do stuff, and then productivity will go up!” This is fucking nonsense, and it’s time to stop idolizing these speciously-informed goobers. While kinder souls or Zitron-haters may read this and say “ahh, actually, what Nadella was saying was…” stop. I want to stop you there and suggest that perhaps a smart person should be able to speak clearly enough that their intent is obvious. It’s tempting to believe that there is some sort of intellectual barrier between you and the powerful — that the confusing and obtuse way that they speak is the sound of genius, rather than somebody who has learned a lot of smart-sounding words without ever learning what they mean. “But Ed, they’re trained to do this!” As someone who has media trained hundreds of people, there is only so much you can do to steer someone’s language. You cannot say to Sundar Pichai “hey man, can you sound more confusing?” You can, however, tell them what not to talk about and hope for the best. Sure, you can make them practice, sure, you can give them feedback, but people past a certain stage of power or popularity are going to talk however they want, and if they’re a big stupid idiot pretending to be smart, they’re going to sound exactly like this. Why? Because nobody in the media ever asks them to explain themselves. When you’ve spent your entire career being asked friendly-or-friendly-adjacent questions and never having someone say “wait, what does that mean?” you will continue to mutate in a pseudo-communicator that spits out information-adjacent bullshit. I am, to be clear, being very specific about that question. Powerful CEOs and founders never, ever get asked to explain what they’re saying, even when what they’re saying barely resembles an actual answer. Pichai, Altman and Nadella have always given this kind of empty-brained intellectual slop in response to questions because the media coddles them. These people are product managers and/or management consultants — and in Altman’s case, a savvy negotiator and manipulator known for “an absenteeism that rankled his peers and some of the startups he was supposed to nurture” as an investor at yCombinator, according to the Washington Post. By “coddle,” I mean these people are deliberately engaging in a combination of detective work and amnesia, where the reader or the listener is forced to simultaneously try and divine the meaning of their answer, while also not thinking too hard about the question the interviewer asked. Look at most modern business interviews. They involve a journalist asking a question, somebody giving an answer, and the journalist saying “okay!” and moving onto the next question, occasionally saying “but what about this?” when the appropriate response to many of the answers is to ask them to simplify them so that their meaning is clearer. A common response to all of this is to say that “interviewers can’t be antagonistic,” and I don’t think a lot of people understand what that means. It isn’t “antagonistic” to ask somebody to clearly articulate what they’re saying, nor is it “antagonistic” to say that you don’t understand, or that they didn’t answer the question you asked. If this is “antagonistic” to you, you are, intellectually-speaking, a giant fucking coward, because what you’re suggesting is that somebody cannot ask somebody to explain themselves, which is what an interview is. And I imagine nobody really wants to do this, because if you actually put these people on the spot, you’d realize the dark truth that I spoke of a few weeks ago: that the reason the powerful sound like idiots is because, well, they’re idiots. They sound like Business Idiots and create products to sell to Business Idiots, because Business Idiots run most companies and buy solutions based on what the last Business Idiot told them. To quote the excellent Nik Suresh: I know some of you might read this and say “these people can’t be stupid! These people run companies! They make huge deals! They read all these books!” and my answer is that some of the stupidest people I’ve ever met have read more books than you or I will read in a lifetime. While they might be smart when it comes to corporate chess moves or saying “this product category should do this,” none of these men — not Altman, Pichai or Nadella — actually has a hand in the design or creation of any of the things their companies make, and they never, ever have. Regardless, I have a larger point: it’s time to start mocking these people and tearing down their legends as geniuses of industry. They are not better than us, nor are they responsible for anything that their companies build other than the share price (which is a meaningless figure) and the accumulation of power and resources. These men are neither smart nor intellectually superior, and it’s time to start treating them as such. These people are powerful because they have names that are protected by the press. They are powerful because it is seen as unseemly to mock them because they are rich and “running a company,” a kind of corporate fealty that I find deeply unbecoming of an adult. We are, at most, customers. We do not “owe them” anything. We are long past the point when any of the people running these companies actually invented anything they sell. iIf anything, they owe us something, because they are selling us a product, even if said product is free and monetised by advertising. While reporters — as anyone — should have some degree of professionalism in interviews or covering subjects, there is no reason to treat these people as special, even if they have managed to raise a lot of money or their product is popular, because if that were the case we’d have far more coverage of defense contractor Lockheed Martin. It made $1.71 billion in profit last quarter, and hasn’t had a single quarter under a billion dollars in the last year. I’m being a little glib, but the logic behind covering OpenAI is, at this point, “it makes a lot of money and its product is popular,” which is also a fitting description of Lockheed Martin. The difference is that OpenAI has a consumer product that loses billions of dollars, and Lockheed Martin has products that makes billions of dollars by removing consumers from the Earth. Both of them are environmentally destructive. Covering OpenAI sure doesn’t seem to be about the tech, because if you looked at the tech you’d have to understand the tech, you’d see that the user numbers weren’t there outside of the 500 million people using ChatGPT, of which very few are actually paying for the product, and that the term “user” encompasses everything from the most occasional users who log in out of curiosity, to people who are actually using it as part of their daily lives. If covering OpenAI was about the tech, you’d read about how the tech itself doesn’t seem to have a ton of mass-market use cases, and those use cases aren’t really the kind of things that you’d pay for. If they did, there’d be articles that definitively discussed them versus articles in the New York Times about “everybody using AI” that boil down to “I use ChatGPT as search now” and “I heard a guy who asked it to teach him about modern art.” Yet men like Dario Amodei and Sam Altman continue to be elevated because they are “building the future,” even if they don’t seem to have built it yet, or have the ability to clearly articulate what that future actually looks like. Anthropic has now put out multiple stories suggesting that its generative AI will “blackmail” people as a means of stopping a user from turning off the system, something which is so obviously the company prompting its models to do so. Every member of the media covering this uncritically should feel ashamed of themselves. Sadly, this is all a result of the halo effect of being a Guy Who Raised Money or Guy Who Runs Big Company. We must, as human beings, assume that these people are smart, and that they’d never mislead us, because if we accept that they aren’t smart and that they willingly mislead us, we’d have to accept that the powerful are, well, bad and possibly unremarkable. And if they’re untrustworthy people that don’t seem that smart, we have to accept that the world is deeply unfair, and caters to people like them far more than it caters to people like us. We do not owe Satya Nadella any respect because he’s the CEO of Microsoft. If anything, we should show him outright scorn for the state of Microsoft products. Microsoft Teams is an insulting mess that only sometimes works, leaving workers spending 57% of their time either in Teams Chat, Teams Meetings or sending emails according to a Microsoft study. MSN.com is an abomination read by hundreds of millions of people a month, bloated with intrusive advertisements, attempts to trick you into downloading an app, and quasi-content that may or may not be AI generated. There are few products on the modern internet that show more contempt for the user -- other than, of course, Skype, a product that Microsoft let languish for more than a decade, the product so thoroughly engorged with spam that leaving it unattended for more than a month left you with a hundred unread messages from Eastern European romance scammers. Microsoft finally killed it in May. Products like Word and Excel don’t need improving, but that doesn’t stop Microsoft from trying, bloating them with odd user interface choices and forcing users to fight with popups to use an AI-powered Copilot that most of them hate. Why, exactly, are we meant to show these people respect? Because they run a company that provides a continually-disintegrating service? Because that service has such a powerful monopoly that it’s difficult to leave it if you’re interacting with other people or businesses? I think it’s because we live in Hell. The modern tech ecosystem is so utterly vile. Every single day our tech breaks in new and inventive ways, our iPhones resetting at random, random apps not accepting button presses, our Bluetooth disconnecting, our word processors harassing us to “try and use AI” while no longer offering us suggestions for typos, and our useful products replaced with useless shit, like how Google’s previously-functional assistants were replaced with generative AI that makes them tangibly worse so that Google can claim it has 350 million monthly active Gemini users. Yet the tech and business media acts as if everything is fine. It isn’t fine! It’s all really fucked! You can call me a cynic or a pessimist or every name under the sun, but the stakes have never been higher, and the damage never more wide-spread. Everything feels broken, and covering these companies as if it isn’t is insulting to your readers and your own intelligence. Look at the state of your computer or phone and tell me anything feels congruent or intentional rather than an endless battle of incentives. Look at the notifications on your phone and count the number of them that have absolutely nothing to do with information you actively need. As we speak, I have a notification from Adobe Lightroom, an app I use occasionally to edit photos, that tells me “Elevate any scene - now enhance people, sky, water and more with Quick Actions.” Zerocam, an app that brands itself “the first anti-AI camera app” where you “capture moments, not megapixels,” gave me a notification asking if I took a photo today. Amazon notified me that there is a deal picked just for me — a battery pack that I bought several months ago. Every single company that sends notifications like these should be mocked, but we have accepted such vile conditions as the norm. Apple should be tarred and feathered for allowing companies to send spam notifications, and yet it isn’t because, by and large, Apple is less vile and less exploitative than Microsoft, Google or Amazon. If you are reading this as a member of the tech press, seriously, please look at your daily experience with tech. Count the number of times that your day or a task is interrupted by poorly-designed software or hardware (such as the many, many times Zoom or Teams has a problem with Bluetooth, or a website just doesn’t load, or you type something into your browser and it just doesn’t do anything), or when the software you use either actively impedes you (hey, did you want to use AI? No? You sure?) or refuses to work in a logical way (see: Google Drive). There are tens of thousands of stories like this every day, and if you talked to people, you’d see how widespread it is…or maybe, I dunno, see that it’s happening to you too? There are people responsible, and the tech media writes about them every day. I realize it seems weird to constantly write that a company is releasing broken, convoluted software, but hey, if we can write 300,000 stories about how crime-ridden New York City is, why can’t we write three of them about how fucked Microsoft Office or Google Search have become? And why can’t we talk to the people in power about it? Is it because the questions are too hard to ask? Is it because it feels icky to interrupt Satya Nadella as he waffles on about using Copilot all the time by saying “hey man, Microsoft Teams is broken, tons of people feel this way, why?” or “why have you let MSN.com turn into a hub of AI slop and outright disinformation?” Oh no! You won’t get your access! Wahh! Who cares? Write a story about how Microsoft has become so unbelievably profitable as its products get worse, and talk about how weird and bad that is for the world! Ask Nadella those tough questions, or publish that Microsoft’s PR wouldn’t let you! These people are neither articulate nor wise, and whatever “intelligence” they may claim to have doesn’t seem to manifest in good products or intelligent statements. So why treat them like they’re smart? Why show them deference or pleasantries? These people have crapped up our digital lives at scale, and they deserve contempt, or at the very least a stern fucking reception. I realize I’m repeating points I’ve made again and again, but why is there such a halo around these fucking bozos? I’m serious! Why are we so protective of these guys? We’re more than happy to criticise celebrities, musicians, professional sports players, and politicians (fucking barely), but the business class is somehow protected outside of the occasional willingness to say that Elon Musk might have sort have done something wrong. I’m not denying there are critics. We have Molly White, Edward Ongweso Jr, Brian Merchant and — at a major outlet like CNN, no less! — one of the greatest living business writers in Allison Morrow. I believe that tech criticism is a barely-explored and hugely-profitable industry if we treated tech journalism less like the society pages and more like a force to hold the most powerful people in the world accountable as they continually harm billions of people in subtle ways. People are angry, and they aren’t stupid, and they want to see that anger reflected in the stories they read — and the meek deference we show to dumb fucking tech leaders is the opposite of that. As I’ve said before: we live in an era of digital tinnitus, nagged by notifications, warring with software ostensibly built for us that acts as if we’re the enemy. And if we’re the enemy, we should treat those building this software as the enemy in return. We are their customers, and they have failed us. The entire approach to business owners, especially in tech, is ridiculous. These people are selling us a product and the product fucking stinks! Put aside however you feel about generative AI for a second and face one very simple point: it doesn’t do enough, it’s really not cool at all, and we’re being forced to use it. I realize that some of you may want them to succeed, or want to be the person who tells everybody that they did so. I get that there are rewards for you — promotions, new positions, TV appearances repeating exactly what the powerful did and why they did it, or a plush role as that company’s head of communications — but I am telling you, your readers and viewers are waking up to it, and they feel like you have contempt for them and contempt for the truth. It’s easy — and common! — to try and dismiss my work as some sort of hater’s screed, a “cynical” approach to a tech industry that’s trying “brave new things” or whatever. In my opinion, there’s nothing more cynical than watching billions of people get shipped increasingly-shitty and expensive solutions and then get defensive of the people shipping them, and hostile to the people who are complaining that the products they use suck. I am angry at these companies because they have, at scale, torn down a tech industry that allowed me to be who I am today, and their intentional and disgraceful moves fill me full of disgust. I have watched the tech media move away from covering “technology” and more toward covering the people behind it, to the point that the actual outputs — the software and hardware we use every day — have taken a backseat to stories about whether Elon Musk does or doesn’t use a computer, which is meaningless, empty gossip journalism built to be shared by peers and nothing else. And please, please do not talk about optimism. If you are blindly saying that everything OpenAI does is cool and awesome and interesting, you aren’t being optimistic — you’re telling other people to be optimistic about a company’s success. It isn’t “optimistic” to believe that a company is going to build powerful AI despite it failing to do so. It’s propaganda, and yes, this is also the case if you simply don’t do the research to form a real opinion. I am not a pessimist because I criticize these companies, and framing me as one is cowardly and ignorant. If you are so weak-willed and speciously-informed that you can’t see somebody criticise a company without outright dismissing them as “a hater” or “pessimist,” you are an insult to journalism or analysis, and you know it in your wretched little heart. My heart sings with a firm belief in the things I think, founded on rigorous structures of knowledge that I’ve gained from reading things and talking to people, because something in me is incapable of being swayed by something just because everybody else is. You are assuming people are right because it is inconvenient and uncomfortable to accept they may not be, because doing so requires you to reckon with a market-wide hysteria founded on desperation and a lack of hyper-growth markets left in the tech industry. Worse still, in engaging with faux-optimism, you are failing to protect your readers and the general public. And if that’s what you want to do, ask yourself why! Why do you want these companies to win? What is it you want them to win? Do you want them to be rich? Do you want to be the person that told people they would be first? What is the world you want, and what does it look like, and how does doing your job in this way work toward creating that world? This isn’t optimism — it’s horse-trading, or strategic alignment behind powerful entities. It is choosing a side, because your side isn’t with the reader or the truth. If it was — even if you believed generative AI was powerful and that they simply didn’t understand — your duty would be to educate the reader in a clear-set and obvious way, and if you can’t find a way to do so, acknowledging that and explaining why. True optimism requires you to have a deep, meaningful understanding of things so that you can engage in real hope — a magical feeling, one that can buoy you in the most challenging times. What many claim is “optimism” is actually blind faith, the likes of which you’ll see at a roulette table. Or, of course, knowingly peddling propaganda. Let’s even take a different tact: say you actually want these companies to “build powerful AI,” and believe they’re smart enough to do so. Say that, somehow, looking at their decaying finances, the lack of revenue, the lack of growth, and the remarkable lack of use cases, you still come out of it saying “sure, I think they’re going to do this!” How? Why haven’t they done it yet? Why, three years in, are we still unable to describe what ChatGPT actually does, and why we need it? Take away how much money OpenAI makes for a second (and, indeed, how much it loses). Does this product actually really inspire anything in you? What is it that’s magical about this? And, on a business level, what is it I’m meant to be impressed by, exactly? OpenAI has — allegedly — hit “$10 billion in annualized revenue” (essentially the biggest month it can find, multiplied by 12), which is…not that much, really, considering it’s the most prominent company in the software world, with the biggest brand, and with the attention of the entirety of the world’s media. It has, allegedly, 500 million weekly active users — and, by the last count, only 15.5 million paying subscribers, an absolutely putrid conversion rate even before you realize that the actual conversion rate would be monthly active subscribers. That’s how any real software company actually defines its metrics, by the fucking way. Why is this impressive? Because it grew fast? It literally had more PR and more marketing and more attention and more opportunities to sell to more people than any company has ever had in the history of anything. Every single industry has been told to think about AI for three years, and they’ve been told to do so because of a company called OpenAI. There isn’t a single god damn product since Google or Facebook that has had this level of media pressure, and both of those companies launched without the massive amount of media (and social media) that we have today. Having literally everybody talking about your product all the time for years is pretty useful! Why isn’t it making more money? Why are we taking any of these people seriously? Mark Zuckerberg paid $14.3 billion for Scale AI, an AI data company, as a means of hiring its CEO Alexandr Wang to run his “superintelligence” team, has been offering random OpenAI employees $100 million to join Meta, thought about buying both AI search company Perplexity and generative video company Runway and even tried to buy OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever’s pre-product “$32bn valuation” non-company Safe Superintelligence, settling instead on hiring its CEO Daniel Gross and buying his venture fund for some fucking reason. When you put aside the big numbers, these are the actions of a desperate dimwit with a failing product trying to buy his way to making generative AI into a “superintelligence,” something that Meta’s own Chief AI scientist Yan LeCun says isn’t going to work. By assuming that there is some sort of grand strategy behind these moves beyond “if we get enough smart people together something will happen,” you help boost the powerful’s messaging and buoy their stock valuations. You are not educating anybody by humouring these goofballs. In fact, the right way to approach this would be to ask why Meta, a multi-trillion dollar market cap company with a near-monopoly over all social media, is spending billions of dollars in what appears to be a totally irresponsible way. Instead, people are suggesting this is Mark Zuckerberg’s genius at work. Anyway, putting that aside, what exactly is the impressive part of generative AI again? The fucking code? Enough about the code, I’m tired of hearing about the code, I swear to god you people think that being a software engineer is only coding and that it’s fine if you ship “mediocre code,” as if bad code can’t bring down entire organizations. What do you think a software engineer does? Is all they do code? If you think the answer is yes, you are wrong! Human beings may make mistakes in writing code, but they at least know what a mistake looks like, which a generative AI does not, because a generative AI doesn’t know what anything is, or anything at all, because it is a probabilistic model. Congratulations! You made another way in which software engineers can automate parts of their jobs — stop being so fucking excited about the idea that people are going to lose their livelihoods! It’s nasty, and founded on absolutely nothing other than your adulation for the powerful! These models are dangerous and chaotic, built with little intention or regard for the future, just like the rest of big tech’s products. ChatGPT would’ve been a much smaller deal if Google had any interest in turning Google Search into a product that truly answered a query (as opposed to generating more of them to show more impressions to advertisers) — a nuanced search engine that took a user’s query and spat out a series of websites that might help answer said question rather than just summarising a few of them for an answer. And if you ever need proof that Google just doesn’t know how to fucking innovate anymore, look at AI Summaries, a product that both misunderstands search and why people use ChatGPT as a search replacement. While OpenAI may “summarise” stuff to give an answer, it at the very least gives something approximating a true answer, rather than a summary that feels like an absentee parent trying to get rid of you and then throwing you $20 in the hopes you’ll leave them alone. If Google Search truly evolved, ChatGPT wouldn’t really matter, because the idea of a machine that can theoretically answer a question is kind of why people used fucking Google in the fucking first place. Again, why are we not describing this company as the business equivalent of a banana republic? It’s actively making its shit worse to juice growth, and it’s really obvious how badly it sucks. Why doesn’t the state of Google dominate tech news, just like how random ketamine-fuelled tweets from Elon Musk do? Why aren’t we, collectively, repulsed by Google as a company? Why aren’t we, collectively, repulsed by OpenAI? No matter how big ChatGPT is, the fact that there’s a product out there with hundreds of millions of users that constantly gets answers wrong is a genuinely worrying thing for society, and that’s before you get to the environmental damage, the fact it trained its models on millions of people’s art and writing, and oh, I dunno, the fact it plans to lose over a hundred billions of dollars before becoming profitable? Why are we not more horrified? Why are we not more forlorn that this is where hundreds of billions of dollars are being forced? The most prominent company in the tech industry is an unstable monolith with a vague product that can only make $10 billion a year (revenue, not profit) as the very fabric of its existence is shoved down the throat of every executive in the world at once. Also, if it’s not fed $20 billion to $40 billion a year, it will die. Give me a fucking break. I don’t know, I sound pretty ornery, I get accused of being a hater or missing the grand mystery of this bullshit every few minutes by somebody with an AI avatar of a guy who looks like he’s banned from multiple branches of Best Buy, I understand there’s things that people do with Large Language Models, I am aware, but none of it matters because the way they’re being discussed is like we’re two steps from digitally replacing hundreds of millions of people. The reality is far simpler: we have an industry that has spent nearly half a trillion dollars between its capital expenditures and venture capital funding to create another industry with the combined revenue of the fucking smartwatch industry. What I’m writing isn’t inflammatory — in fact, it’s far more deeply rooted in reality than those claiming that OpenAI is building the future. Let’s do some fucking mathematics! Projected Big Tech Capital Expenditures in 2025 and revenue from AI: That’s $327 billion this year, with a total revenue of…what, $18 billion of revenue? And that’s not profit! And that’s if we include OpenAI’s spend on Azure. Even if every single one of these companies was making $18 billion in revenue a year from this it wouldn’t be great, but it’s more than likely that these chunderfucks can’t even pull together the projected revenue ($32 billion) of the global smartwatch industry! What a joke! “Wuhh, but what about OpenAI?” What about OpenAI? I’ve written about this so much. So what, OpenAI makes $12.7 billion this year, but loses $14 billion, what does that mean to you, exactly? What’re you going to say? The cost of inference is coming down? No, the cost that people are being charged is going down, we have no firm data on the actual costs because the companies don’t want to talk about it, and yes, it will absolutely lower prices to compete with other companies. The Information just reported that OpenAI was doing this to compete with Microsoft last week! Hey, quick question — wasn’t SoftBank meant to spend $3 billion annually on OpenAI’s software? Did that happen? Anyway, even if we add OpenAI’s revenue to the pot, we are at $30.7 billion. If we add the supposed $1 billion in revenue from training data startup Surge, $300 million in “annualized revenue” from Turing, optimistically assume that Perplexity will have $100 million (up from $34 million in 2024, where it burned $65 million) in revenue in 2025, and assume that Anysphere’s (which makes Cursor) $200 million run rate stays consistent through 2025, we are at…$32.3 billion. But I'm not being fair, am I? I didn’t include many of the names from The Information’s generative AI database. Prepare yourself, this is gonna be annoying! So let's add some more. We’ve got $3 billion from Anthropic, $870 million from Scale (now part of Meta), another alleged $300 million for Anysphere (The Information claims $500 million in ARR), we consider Neo4j’s “>$200 million ARR” to mean “$200 million,” Midjourney’s “>$200 million ARR” to mean $200m, Ironclad’s “>$150 million ARR” to mean $150 million ARR, Glean’s $103 million ARR, Together AI’s $100 million ARR, Moveworks’ $100 million ARR, Abridge’s $100 million ARR, Synthesia’s $100 million ARR, WEKA’s “>$100 million ARR” to mean $100m ARR, Windsurf’s $100m ARR, Runway’s $84 million ARR, Elevenlabs’ “>$100m ARR” to mean $100m ARR, Cohere’s $70m ARR, Jasper’s “>$60m ARR” to mean $60m, Harvey’s $50m ARR, Ada’s “>$50m ARR” to mean $50m, Photoroom’s $50m ARR…and then assumed the combined ARR of the remainders are somewhere in the region of a very generous $200m, we get… Less than $39 billion dollars of total revenue in the entire generative AI industry. Jesus fucking christ! According to The Information, generative AI companies have raised more than $18.8 billion in the first quarter of 2025, after investing $21 billion in Q4 2024 and $4 billion in Q3 2024 for a grand total of $43.8 billion, or a total of $370.8 billion of investment and capital expenditures for an industry that, despite being the single-most talked about thing on the planet, cannot even create a tenth of the dollars it requires to make it work. These companies are predominantly unprofitable, perpetually searching for product-market fit, and even when they find it, seem incapable of generating revenue numbers that remotely justify their valuations. If I’m honest, I think the truly radical position here is the one taken by most tech reporters that would rather take the lazy position of “well Uber lost a lot of money!” than think for two seconds about whether we’re all being sold a line of shit. What we’re watching is a mountain of waste perpetuated by the least-charming failsons of our generation. Nobody should be giving Satya Nadella or Sam Altman a glossy profile — they should be asking direct, brutal questions, much like Joanna Stern just did of Apple’s Craig Federighi, who had absolutely fucking nothing to share because he has never been pushed like this. Put aside the money for a second and be honest: these men are pathetic, unimpressive, uninventive, and dreadfully, dreadfully boring. Anthropic’s Wario (Sorry, Dario) Amodei and OpenAI’s Sam Altman have far more in common with televangelist Joel Olstein than they’ll ever have with Steve Jobs or any number of people that have actually invented things, and they got that way because we took them seriously instead of saying “wait, what do you mean?” To a single one of their wrongheaded, oafish and dim-witted hype-burps. It’s boring! I’m terribly, horribly bored, and if you’re interested in this shit I am genuinely curious why, especially if you’re a reporter, because right now the “innovation” happening in AI is, at best, further mutations of the Software As A Service business model, providing far less value than previous innovations at a calamitous cost. Reasoning models don’t even reason, as proven by an Apple paper released a few weeks ago, and agents as a concept are fucked because large language models are inherently unreliable — and yes, a study out of fucking Salesforce found that agents began to break down when given multi-step tasks, such as “any task you’d want to have an agent automate.” So, here’s my radical suggestion: start making fun of these people. They are not charming. They are not building anything. They have scooted along amassing billions of dollars promising the world and delivering you a hill of dirt. They deserve our derision — or, at the very least, our deep, unerring suspicion, if not for what they’ve done, but for what they’ve not done. Sam Altman is nowhere near delivering a functioning agent, let alone anything approaching intelligence, and really only has one skill: making other companies risk a bunch of money on his stupid ideas. No, really! He convinced Oracle to buy $40 billion of NVIDIA chips to put in the Abilene Texas “Stargate” data center, despite the fact that the Stargate organization has yet to be formed (as reported by The Information). SoftBank and Microsoft pay all of OpenAI’s bills, and the media does his marketing for him. OpenAI is, as I said, quite literally a banana republic. It requires the media and the markets to make up why it has to exist, it requires other companies to pump it full of money and build its infrastructure, and it doesn’t even make products that matter, with Sam Altman constantly talking about all the exciting shit other people will build. You can keep honking about how “it built the API that will power the future,” but if that’s the case, where’s the fucking future, exactly? Where is it? What am I looking at here? Where’s the economic activity? Where’s the productivity? The returns suck! The costs are too high! Why am I the radical person for saying this? This entire situation is absolutely god damn ridiculous, an incomparable waste even if it somehow went in the green. For the horrendous amounts of capital invested in generative AI to make sense, the industry would have to have revenue that dwarfed the smartphone and enterprise SaaS market combined, rather than less than half of that of the mobile gaming industry. Satya Nadella, Sam Altman, Wario Amodei, Tim Cook, Andy Jassy — they deserve to be laughed at, mocked, or at the very least interrogated vigorously, because their combined might has produced no exciting or interesting products outside of, at best, what will amount to a productivity upgrade for integrated development environments and faster ways to throw out code that may or may not be reliable. These things aren’t nothing, but they’re nowhere near the something that we’re being promised. So I put it to you, dear reader: why are we taking them seriously? What is there to take seriously other than their ability to force stuff on people? And I’ll leave you with a question: how do they manage to keep doing this, exactly? They always seem to find new growth, every single quarter, without fail? Is it because they keep coming up with new ideas? Or is it because they come up with new ideas to get more money, a vastly different choice that involves increasing the prices of products or making them worse so that they can show you more advertisements. My positions are not radical, and if you believe they are, your deference to the powerful disgusts me. In any case, I want to end this with something inspirational, because I believe that things change when regular people feel stronger and more capable. I want you to know that you are fully capable of understanding all of this. I don’t care if you “aren’t a numbers person” or “don’t get business.’ I don’t have a single iota of economics training, and everything you’ve ever read me write has been something I’ve had to learn. I was a layperson right up until I learned the stuff, then I became a stuff-knower, just like you can be. The tech industry, the finance industry, the entire mechanisms of capitalism want you to believe that everything they do is magical and complex, when it’s all far more obvious than you’d believe. You don’t have to understand the entire fundamentals of finance to know how venture capital works — they buy percentages of companies at a valuation that they hope is much lower than the company would be worth in the future. You don’t need to be technical to know that Large Language Models generate a response based on billions of pieces of training data, and by guessing at what the next bit of text in a line should be based on what it’s seen previously. These people love to say “ah, but didn’t you see-” and present an anecdote, when no anecdote will ever defeat the basics of “your business doesn’t make any money, the software doesn’t do the things you claim it’s meant to, and you have no path to profitability.” They can yammer at you all they want about “lots of people using ChatGPT,” but that doesn’t change the fact that ChatGPT just isn’t that revolutionary, and their only play here is to make you feel stupid rather than actually showing you why it’s so fucking revolutionary. This is the argument of a manipulator and a coward, and you are above such things. You don’t really have to be a specialist in anything to pry this shit apart, which is why so much of my work is either engaging to those who learn something from it or frustrating to those that intentionally deceive others through gobbledygook hype-schpiel. I will sit here and explain every fucking part of this horrid chain of freaks, and break it down into whatever pieces it takes to educate as many people as I have to to make things change. I also must be clear that I am nobody. I started writing this newsletter with 300 subscribers and no reason other than the fact I wanted to, and four years later I have nearly 64,000 subscribers and an award-winning podcast. I have no economics training, no special access, no deep sources, just the ability to look at things that are happening and say stuff. I taught myself everything I know about this industry, and there is nothing stopping you from doing the same. I was convinced I was stupid until around two years ago, though if I’m honest it might have been last year. I have felt othered the majority of my life, convinced by people that I am incapable or unwelcome, and as I’ve become more articulate and confident in who I am and what I believe in, I have noticed that the only people that seek to degrade or suppress are those of weak minds and weaker wills — Business Idiots in different forms and flavors. I have learned to accept who I am — that I am not like most people — and people conflate my passion and vigor with anger or hate, when what they’re experiencing is somebody different who deeply resents what the powerful have done to the computer. And while I complain about the state of media, what I’ve seen in the last year is that there are many, many people like me — both readers and peers — that resent things in the same way. I conflated being different with being alone, and I couldn’t be more wrong. For those of you that don’t wish to lick the boots of the people fucking up every tech product, the tent is large, it’s a big club, and you’re absolutely in it. A better tech industry is one where the people writing about it hold it accountable, pushing it toward creating the experiences and connectivity that truly change the world rather than repeating and reinforcing the status quo. Don’t watch the mouth, watch the hands. These companies will tell you that they’re amazing as many times as they want, but you don’t need to prove that — they do. I don’t care if you tell a single human soul about my work, but if it helps you understand these people better, use it to teach other people. These people may seem all-powerful, but they’ve built the Rot Economy on a combination of anonymity and a placant press, but pressure against them starts with you and those you know understanding how their businesses work, and trusting that you can understand because you absolutely can. Millions of people understanding how these people run their companies and how poorly they’ve built their software will stop people like Sundar Pichai from being able to quietly burn Google Search to the ground. People like Sam Altman are gambling that you are easily-confused, easily-defeated and incurious, when you could be writing thousands of words on a newsletter that you never, ever edit for brevity. You can understand every fucking part of their business — the economics of OpenAI, the flimsy promises of Salesforce, the destruction of Google Search — and you can tell everybody you know about it, and suddenly it won’t be so easy for these wretched creeps to continue thriving. I know it sounds small, and like your role is even smaller, but the reason they’ve grown so rapaciously is driven by the sense that the work they do is some sort of black magic, when it’s really fucking stupid and boring finance stapled onto a tech industry that’s run out of ideas. You are more than capable of understanding this entire world — including the technology, along with the finances that ultimately decide what technology gets made next. These people have got rich and famous and escaped all blame by casting themselves as somehow above us, when if I’m honest, I’ve never looked down on somebody quite as much as I do the current gaggle of management consultant fucks that have driven Silicon Valley into the ground.

Title: Apple Reportedly Has Numerous XR Headsets & Glasses Coming Between Now & 2028

Time Published: 2025-06-30T14:49:39Z
Full Content:
Independent tech analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reports that Apple’s XR and smart glasses roadmap will feature multiple XR devices, including a spec-bumped Vision Pro slated to release later this year. At the far end of the spectrum, Kuo also says Apple is making AR glasses, reportedly coming in 2028. Kuo is a long-time tech analyst and respected figure in Apple product leaks. In a new blogpost, Kuo has laid out a timeline for a number of Apple XR releases, ostensibly based on various supply chain leaks. Kuo reports that a new Vision Pro featuring the company’s M5 chip is scheduled for mass production in Q3 2025, with 150,000–200,000 units expected to ship. This next Vision Pro is reportedly upgrading the chip from M2 to M5, but will otherwise retain the original specs. Kuo maintains the iterative approach is based on Vision Pro’s current position as a niche product, as the company hopes to use the next version to maintain market presence, reduce component stock, and further refine XR applications. Next, Kuo says Apple is preparing a much lighter headset, reportedly called ‘Vision Air’, set to release in Q3 2027. Vision Air is said to be dramatically lighter at over 40% less than the current Vision Pro, which weighs in at 21.2–22.9 ounces (600–650 g), excluding the battery. Kuo maintains Vision Air will include plastic lenses, magnesium alloys, fewer sensors, a top-tier iPhone chip, and be priced significantly lower to appeal to broader users. The true next-gen Vision device is said to be ‘Vision Pro 2’ though, which Kuo says could arrive in 2H 2028, replete with a full redesign, Mac-grade chip, reduced weight, and a lower price, signaling Apple’s shift to move away from niche XR products and move toward mainstream adoption. Meanwhile, Kuo says Apple is investing heavily in smart glasses. A Ray-Ban-like, audio-first wearable is expected to arrive in Q2 2027, Kuo says, noting that the company is hoping to manufacture 3–5 million units—ostensibly a significant push towards making its first smart glasses a mainstream success. Like Ray-Ban Meta, and the recently unveiled Oakley Meta HSTN, Apple’s smart glasses are said to have no display, rather offering audio playback, photo and video capture, an AI assistant, and both gesture and voice controls. Arguably the biggest claim among Kuo’s timeline is the mention of Apple XR Glasses, which the analyst maintains will include a color display (LCoS + waveguide) and AI features, making it the first true AR glasses from the company. Kuo says Apple is targeting release in 2H 2028, with a lighter variant being developed in parallel. This follows reports of Apple potentially scraping a more casual XR glasses-type viewer, which would be tethered to Apple devices and use birdbath optics. The device was originally planned for release in Q2 2026, but Kuo maintains it was paused in late 2024 due to insufficient differentiation, especially around weight. Granted, Apple is one of the most opaque black boxes in tech for a reason. The company historically announces products on stage, which typically also comes with a price and release date attached. While Kuo has a fairly reliable track record of reporting insider knowledge of Vision Pro, we’re taking this data dump with an equally-sized grain of salt. This article may contain affiliate links. If you click an affiliate link and buy a product we may receive a small commission which helps support the publication. More information. Low specced, high-priced and served with plenty of Kool Aid. Some premium iPhones can't even run AI due to Apple's stingy memory. But they're the best and most excellently optimised things ever. Except when it comes to future proofing. Give me Samsung and similar any day. We owe a huge debt to Apple as regards smartphone evolution, but they're like your dad on the sofa now, wearing a jumper and watching Bowls. The minimum requirement for using Apple AI is an A17 Pro or A18, which double the NPU performance from ~16/17 TOPS on A15/A16 to 35 TOPS. All iPhones using the A17 Pro/A18 also come with 8GB of RAM compared to 6GB before, so you can run Apple AI on iPhone Pro/Plus from 2023 or all iPhones from 2024 or later. But it's not just the RAM that's the issue here. After years of annoyingly keeping the basic Mac configuration at 8GB, Apple now switched everything to at least 16GB esp. to be able to run Apple AI, so the stingy memory policy and obscene upgrade prices certainly play a part. But a lot of people using basic M1 MacBooks with 8GB RAM from late 2020 still see no reason to upgrade, because the speed is fine, and thanks to very fast SSDs and clever MacOS memory management, these 8GB will get you a lot further than on a Windows laptop. Just not for AI, which needs very fast access to gigabytes large models, with swapping not an option. So these users won't get Apple AI, which many consider a feature instead of a bug. And usually Apple devices get a lot longer support than anything Android, which may count for "future proofing". No doubt they are low specced, high-priced and served with plenty of Kool Aid. But as Apple controls the OS, the specs are typically well balanced for the majority of users. And even the most basic configuration will usually work just fine for at least half a decade with continued OS updates, though you might not get all of the latest features, and even longer security updates. TL;DR: 2025 M5 Vision Pro with the same issues, but more speed, for the enterprise market; 2027 A21 Vision Air for consumers, addressing the comfort/price issues, but otherwise offering the same experience as the current M2 AVP. A Vision Air makes a lot of sense, as it addresses high weight and price, which are the main issues most reviewers had/have with the AVP. By now Apple has learned how people use AVP, and can try to achieve the same experience with less/newer hardware. The M- and A-Series chips use the same types of cores, just in different configurations, with A-chips designed for low power mobile. By 2027 the M2 will be five years old, so a high end A-SoC should be faster, allowing for the same experience as the M2 AVP, but with less power/money/weight. And by reducing the huge amount of sensors to what is essential, they may be able to drop the extra R1 signal processor that works in parallel to the M2 in AVP. A more difficult question is who the M5 update is for. It not a redesign, mostly a SoC replacement with maybe some minor changes, similar to Pico 4 Ultra compared to Pico 4. But all it effectively does is bump up the speed, and this is the one area where AVP hasn't been widely criticized. Price/weight/power consumption/comfort all stay the same and will only be addressed by the Vision Air. So from a consumer perspective, they might as well have continued to sell the M2 AVP until the Air arrives. My guess is that this upgrade is mostly about pushing AVP for enterprise use instead of the consumer market. With no apps demanding it, regular customers won't really benefit from the extra power, but a large company running their own custom software might. Earlier this months Apple showed a couple of new features of visionOS 26, one of which was co-located AR, allowing several people using AVP in the same physical space to work together on virtual objects. This was demonstrated with Dassault Systèmes, who are a heavy weight in the aerospace CAD and simulation market and offer a number of compute-heavy engineering solutions. That's the type of software companies buy expensive workstation hardware for, and they most certainly would love every bit of speed they can get, money/power/weight be damned. If this is what Apple is going for, the next Apple Vision most XR users will care about will arrive in 2027 and no longer bear the "Pro" label. And what is released later this year will take the Pro more serious and explicitly target the enterprise market. Apple has done silent updates before, upping the specs without an actual product instructions, just offering a short press release. And if the M5 AVP is indeed aimed at the professional market, "the company historically announces products on stage, which typically also comes with a price and release date attached" may not apply here. So maybe don't expect any big announcement for later this year, or (mis-)interpret a lack of such announcements as Apple pulling back from XR. Excellent analysis and summary. I do think there will be more than just an M2-M5 upgrade. There are simple things Apple can do around the headstrap design (too heavy on the bridge of your nose/face) and upgraded battery. I do agree it will have more enterprise features (and would expect some partnership announcements with the big MDM players. I also think they will introduce multi-user device sharing. Technically visionOS is based on iPadOS, which has multi-user profile functionality, but ONLY for MDM users like schools or companies. So it would make sense to also introduce it for AVP as an enterprise feature, as it most likely existed in the OS from day one. Just not for regular consumer peasants. I'm somewhat pessimistic regarding other hardware changes though, mostly because Kuo said that "the company hopes to use the next version to maintain market presence, reduce component stock, and further refine XR applications." We knew right from the beginning that AVP production was limited by Sony microOLED availability to at most 450K units per year. But they sold even less, apparently a lot less than they expected, and some time ago told their manufacturers to stop producing new components, planing to sell off existing stock until a successor arrives. So they may be sitting on a large pile of sensors, displays, cases and head straps not yet used, making them reluctant to offer some easy to achieve improvements. The estimated 150K-200K (per year/total?) M5 AVP units may all use mostly components they already ordered for the original AVP, with only the SoC being replaced. They could have stockpiled a few hundred thousands of these too, but AVP is now the last Apple device sold still using M2, everything else has been moved to a newer generation, which may be another reason for the upgrade besides more power for enterprise users. Ok, if the guy is right that’s getting ridiculous… …3 more years to have a true successor to AVP. It better go directly 8k per eye, holographic lenses with varifocal and weigh less than 150g by then because that’s next century in nerd years. And 40 percent lighter for a vision air with plastic lenses in 2 years, that’s pathetic both in terms of specs (still way too heavy) and way too late.. Apple is really a company falling apart. There is no excitement with them, since cook took over, it’s as dull as an insurance company. Yes, Tim Cook is for Apple what Bob Iger is for Disney. Profit and wokeness, but no soul. So for the 2027 Quest 4, we hope for 2.5K/3.5K microOLED, better passthrough, eye tracking, and XR2 Gen 3 with ~2.8x the graphics performance of the 2023 Quest 3, at roughly the same size/weight. And if Apple, who's 2024 AVP already offers 3.5K microOLEDs, excellent passthrough, eye tracking and ~50% more raw GPU performance than Quest 3, doesn't manage to one year after Quest 4 release an AVP2 that offers tech that doesn't even work as prototypes yet, at less than 1/3rd the weight of Quest 3, and technically completely unfeasible for anybody else, they are falling apart, because they are as dull as an insurance company. In the last 20 years, Apple has invented nothing but iPhones. – Always faster iPhones, sometimes a bit bigger, sometimes a bit smaller – Very small iPhones with a strap (iWatch) – Very large iPhones (iPad) – iPhones you can strap to your face (Apple Vision Pro) – Large foldable iPhones with a keyboard (MacBook Air) Oh yes, and of course AirPods too! Innovation looks different than constantly just varying the same theme.

Title: Differentiating bacteria by their unique surface interactions

New, rapid, and accessible approaches to bacterial detection are necessary to help curb the rising impacts of antimicrobial resistance. In this study, we introduce a technique that distinguishes bacteria through their unique surface interactions. By measuring and combining the interaction strengths of a bacterium across a set of chemically defined surfaces, we produced a novel bacterial identifier termed the surface interaction profile (SIP). The interaction strengths of twelve test bacteria across three discrete polyelectrolyte multilayer films (PEMs) were measured, facilitated by introducing each bacterial suspension to individual PEMs in microfluidic channels over a 10-minute interaction period and rinsing to remove bulk and loosely bound bacteria. The remaining surface-bound cells were counted via microscopy and plotted against suspension concentrations to build attachment curves whose slopes were measured as the strength of interaction for a given bacteria-PEM combination. These slopes were collected, per bacterial type, to produce each SIP. SIPs were capable of distinguishing between our pathogenic strains (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus) by Gram stain and individual species, and each blind test pathogen was successfully identified through SIP comparison. Furthermore, SIPs were also successful at differentiating between select Staphylococcus aureus walKR mutants impacting cell wall metabolism and high-risk antibiotic resistance mutants (MRSA and VISA), highlighting the utility and future diagnostic potential of this technique.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Rapid bacterial diagnostics are essential in the global response to rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR). In principle, improving the turnaround time for bacterial identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) enables doctors to quickly prescribe effective antibiotics, improving patient outcomes while reducing the overuse and misuse of antibiotics that contribute to the further breeding of resistance [1,2]. In practice, traditional approaches (e.g., culture-based, phenotypic, turbidimetric) and improved or emerging rapid techniques (e.g., nucleic acid amplification tests, mass spectrometry, enhanced turbidity) are either significantly time-consuming or resource-intensive [3]. Furthermore, emerging technologies are limited in their routine use and implementation in low-resource settings due to significant cost and operational barriers [4,5]. A chorus of risk factors, including limited access to clean water and sanitation, poor infection control practices in healthcare facilities, and a lack of antibiotic stewardship, increase the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant infections, associated mortality rates and healthcare costs in developing countries [6,7]. Continued progress toward new, rapid, and accessible approaches to pathogen detection is necessary to curb the global impact of AMR by improving diagnostics and infection surveillance practices beyond our borders. This study introduces a novel technique that differentiates bacteria based on their surface interactions, with the aim of developing a more rapid and less resource-intensive bacterial diagnostic. Variability in bacterial surface composition is observed across classes of bacteria, from broader differences between Gram stain and species to more subtle differences between strains and individual mutants, which impact the expression of virulence factors and/or antibiotic resistance [8–13]. Their unique surface composition and chemistry directly influence how they interact with surfaces [14,15], including those in their natural environments. The early stages of attachment are facilitated predominantly by electrostatics and, to a lesser extent, van der Waals forces and hydrophobic interactions [16–18]. In this context, the bacterial surface becomes a viable, versatile target for detection, offering a broad spectrum of potential surface interactions that can be utilized to differentiate between a wide array of bacteria. The attachment of bacterium A and B to an identical substrate C may not yield a measurable difference in their interaction strengths to differentiate them, primarily due to the small pool of possible interactions available when using a single substrate as a probe. Increasing the number and chemical diversity of substrates for which interaction strengths are measured enhances the capacity and complexity of potential interactions used to differentiate. In principle, this would allow for more nuanced variations in surface composition to be detectable, improving the probability of distinguishing bacterium A from B while also expanding the potential utility beyond species- or strain-level identification. By integrating interaction strengths across multiple chemically distinct surfaces we generate a unique bacterial identifier, the surface interaction profile (SIP) (Fig 1), designed to differentiate bacteria by direct comparison and to identify a clinical pathogen causing infection through comparison across a library of pre-measured SIPs. a, A schematic depicting the SIP, a novel bacterial identifier produced by combining interaction strengths between a given bacterium and a series of chemically unique surfaces. b, An illustration of a polyelectrolyte multilayer film assembled via the layer-by-layer approach. c-e, The chemical structures of polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA), polystyrene sulfonate (PSS), and polyethylenamine (PEI). f, A schematic of six test PEM surfaces (grey circles) encased in microfluidic channels (squares) in a polystyrene Petri dish. g, The protocol for bacterial-surface interactions: (1) pre-soaking PEM with PBS buffer (30 min), (2) introducing bacterial suspensions to each channel, (3) leaving them in contact for 10 minutes, and (4) rinsing channels with PBS. a, A schematic depicting the SIP, a novel bacterial identifier produced by combining interaction strengths between a given bacterium and a series of chemically unique surfaces. b, An illustration of a polyelectrolyte multilayer film assembled via the layer-by-layer approach. c-e, The chemical structures of polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA), polystyrene sulfonate (PSS), and polyethylenamine (PEI). f, A schematic of six test PEM surfaces (grey circles) encased in microfluidic channels (squares) in a polystyrene Petri dish. g, The protocol for bacterial-surface interactions: (1) pre-soaking PEM with PBS buffer (30 min), (2) introducing bacterial suspensions to each channel, (3) leaving them in contact for 10 minutes, and (4) rinsing channels with PBS. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0327489.g001 To test the distinguishing power of SIPs, we quantified the surface interaction strengths of twelve test bacteria across three discrete, chemically distinct polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) films (Fig 1b) topped with the following positive- and negative-charged polymers: poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) (Fig 1c), polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) (Fig 1d), and polyethylenimine (PEI) (Fig 1e). All PEMs were encased in individual microfluidic channels (Fig 1f) and were exposed to four serially diluted bacterial suspensions (prepared via three biological replicates) through the following steps (Fig 1g): (1) pre-soaking the PEMs, (2) introducing bacterial suspensions to the channels, (3) leaving them in contact for 10 minutes, and (4) removing excess and loosely bound cells via rinsing. The remaining surface-attached bacteria were counted via optical microscopy and plotted against all suspension concentrations to build attachment curves (S1 Fig). Their slopes represented the interaction strength values for each bacterial-PEM combination and were collected (per bacterium) to produce each SIP (Fig 1g). A set of pathogens responsible for the majority of nosocomial infections [19] was tested to compare SIPs of bacteria broadly by Gram stain and individual species, including a blind experiment. This was followed by comparing SIPs across Staphylococcus aureus mutants affecting cell wall metabolism and antibiotic resistance (including single- and multi-drug-resistant mutants). The stock solutions (10 mg/mL) for polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA) (Aldrich, 208.00 mg/mL, Mw 100,000–200,000), polyethylenimine (PEI) (Aldrich, 50% wt, Mw 750,000), and polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) (Aldrich, 344.13 mg/mL, Mw 200,000) polyelectrolytes were prepared by weight and dissolved in deionized (DI) water (pH 6.998, Millipore Milli-Q) with magnetic stirring. Three working polymer solutions (1 mg/mL) for each polymer type were prepared by diluting each respective stock (x10) with DI water and were sonicated (10 minutes) prior to use. Using a template (S3 Fig a), thirty-six small circles (1 cm diameter) were drawn across the interior of six Petri dish lids that formed the perimeter of each individual PEM surface. Three polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) type surfaces were prepared via the layer-by-layer approach with the following combinations of positive and negative polymer layers: PDDA/PSS (5.5 bilayer, positively charged PDDA-topped PEM), PDDA/PSS (5 bilayer, negatively charged PSS-topped PEM), and PEI/PSS (5.5 bilayer, positively charged PEI-topped PEM). To begin, a small aliquot (100 µL) of the positively charged polymer was added to each marked circle: PDDA (1 mg/mL) for PDDA- (N = 12) and PSS-topped (N = 12) PEMs, and PEI (1 mg/mL) for the PEI-topped PEM surfaces (N = 12). Once the positive polymer solution was added to each circle (N = 36), they were left to interact for 1 minute. After the interaction period, each individual surface was rinsed from top to bottom (unidirectional flow) in the order that the polymer was added (~2 seconds duration per surface) with a light stream of DI water: the rinsing protocol is detailed in S4 Fig. With a single Petri lid held at an approximately 35˚ angle (a), three of six surfaces were rinsed individually from left to right (b) with the DI water waste collecting at the bottom lip of the lid. The lid was then rotated counterclockwise by 180˚ (c), maintaining its angled position and allowing the excess water to flow around the lid edge. The final three surfaces were rinsed from above in the same order (left to right) as above (d), and the accumulated DI water was subsequently poured out (e). The lids were then flipped upside down and firmly tapped eight times against three piled Kimwipes on the lab bench, removing excess DI water without contacting the PEMs (f). This process was repeated for all remaining surfaces. A small aliquot (100 µL) of PSS (1 mg/mL) was then added to all 36 surfaces in sequence and left to incubate for 1 minute. The same rinsing protocol (above) was used post-incubation. This cycle of polymer addition and rinsing was repeated a total of 9 times for the (+) PEMs and 8 times for the (-) PEMs. The polymer incubation period for the last two layers of each PEM type (layers 10 and 11 of the (+) PEMs and layers 9 and 10 for the (-) PEMs) were left to incubate for 5 minutes. After the final rinsing step, when all polyelectrolyte layers had been added, the surfaces were left to dry with the lids ajar. Four strips of double-sided tape (1/2 in. double-sided polyester film tape, Tesa) were cut (6 cm long), and one strip (i) was added between two of three PEM surfaces in each row (S3 Fig b). On either side of the first strip of tape, two more strips (ii and iii) were added parallel to the first at 0.7 cm on either side. Finally, the last strip (iv) was added with the same 0.7 cm spacing to the left of strip iii. This was repeated for all six Petri dish lids. Next, the top plastic layer of each strip of tape was carefully removed using a tweezer. Each PEM surface was topped with a thin glass coverslip (1.5x1.5 cm, VWR), where the PEM was positioned at the center, and the coverslip edges contacted the double-sided tape strips on either side (S3 Fig b). Pressure was applied by hand at all points of contact between the cover slip and tape. All chip inlets and the inlet-facing edge of all coverslips had hydrophobic boundaries drawn on via a black permanent marker (S3 c). Bacteria were first prepared by inoculating the strain of interest and incubating it overnight with shaking (220 RPM) at 37˚C in LB. Bacteria were sub-cultured the next day at 1:1000 into fresh LB and incubated with shaking at 37˚C for 4–6 hours to the desired optical densities measured at 600 nm (OD600). The specific species, strains, mutants, and OD600 measurements pre- and post-resuspension in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) can be found in S1 Table. All test bacteria were laboratory stock, and all Staphylococcus aureus walKR mutants were sourced from a previous study [20]. S. aureus ATCC29213 walR EV and walR murOP were both grown in LB containing 12 µg/mL chloramphenicol, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) CA-USA300 ∆tarO-10 was grown in LB containing 300 µg/mL spectinomycin. Next, two 1 mL aliquots were transferred to individual Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 8000 x g for 3 minutes to obtain a pellet for each strain. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended with 500 µL PBS. The 500 µL suspensions of two tubes from the same original culture were combined to produce a concentrated suspension (1 mL) each. The cells were rinsed two more times with PBS. Subsequently, all concentrated PBS suspensions were further serially diluted two-fold to produce four unique dilutions per suspension labelled C1-C4 from lowest to highest cell concentration. All bacteria were tested using three biological replicates, where each suspension was prepared from a single colony. All fluidic chips were arranged by PEM type in a biosafety cabinet with Petri covers removed. Groups of three PEMs in a row were marked C1-C4, covering all cell suspension concentrations per PEM type (N = 3 replicates per concentration per PEM type). The steps involved in the addition of a bacterial suspension to a fluid lane are illustrated in S5 Fig. Once the same-day bacterial suspensions reached the desired range of optical densities, all 36 fluid lanes were pre-wet with 100 µL of PBS for 30 minutes (1). Post-wetting, excess PBS buffer was removed via Kimwipe contact at both the fluid lane inlets and outlets while preventing the removal of PBS from the fluid lane interiors. Aliquots (70 µL) of C1-C4 cell suspensions were pipetted onto the marked lane inlets (N = 36), one suspension per lane per PEM type in triplicates, and were wicked through in sequence via Kimwipes in contact with the lane outlet (2). The suspensions were left to interact for 10 minutes (3). Post-interaction, all lanes were rinsed with a 100 µL aliquot of PBS buffer in the sequence that the suspensions were wicked through initially (4). This step was repeated for a total of 200 µL PBS wicked through using a fresh Kimwipe per lane. With all lanes rinsed, each PEM surface (N = 36) was imaged 10 times per surface (N = 360 total images per type of bacterium) using an inverted microscope (S5 Fig). All images were taken at 200x magnification, and the positions along each surface were selected randomly (S6 Fig). Areas containing large pieces of dust or debris were avoided. All images were batch processed in ImageJ (open source) to count the surface-bound cells: the left and right edges were cropped out, followed by applying the Find Maxima function (15 prominence, excluding edge cases) to extract cell counts. The batch processing macros code is as follows: makeRectangle(503, 1, 925, 1079); run(“Crop”); run(“Find Maxima...”, “prominence=15 exclude output=Count”); The mean cell counts across replicates per added bacterial suspension concentration (OD600) were plotted to produce attachment curves (mean ± SEM) per PEM type per bacterium (S2 Fig). All cell counts across all replicates were plotted per added bacterial suspension concentration (OD600) and a linear regression was applied. The interaction strength values (slope values) per bacterial-PEM combination were collected per bacterial type to produce each bacteria-specific SIP. Polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) films were selected as the probe substrates in this study due to their simple and highly reproducible fabrication process, the layer-by-layer assembly (Fig 1b), which yields robust thin films with easily adjustable surface properties [21]. The PEM surface properties (e.g. charge, hydrophobicity, roughness) are determined by the deposition conditions (e.g. pH, ionic strength) and the polymer type, primarily in the topmost exposed layer [22,23]. Each individual PEM offers a variety of interactions from the charged (positive or negative), uncharged, hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties present in the polymers used, expanding the pool of interactions needed while maintaining a small number of probing substrates. The individual polymer layers are deposited under equilibrium conditions, such that while they are structurally amorphous, the distribution of these distinct chemical features is reproducibly uniform. All fabricated PEMs used in this study were pre-wet with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) for 30 minutes to allow them time to reconfigure through polymer relaxation and to prevent this process from impacting the bacterial-PEM interactions. Bacteria were introduced as liquid suspensions in PBS to ensure that they remained viable throughout the duration of each experiment. The suspensions were introduced to each PEM through individual microfluidic channels (Fig 1f) that were designed to limit variability in fluid flow rate and direction. Shear stress caused by fluid flow can significantly impact bacterial attachment [24], requiring consistent control over the hydrodynamics of our channels. The SIPs of all test bacteria were plotted as a heat map (Fig 2a), highlighting distinct differences in the relative magnitudes of their interaction strengths across each PEM. While grouping the pathogen SIPs by Gram stain (Fig 2b), we observed the Gram-negative bacteria as having a stronger attachment preference for PEI while the Gram-positive bacteria preferred PSS. This was unsurprising, given that these two classes represent broad differences in bacterial envelope structure and surface chemistry, including polymer layers that encompass the cell. They comprise lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in Gram-negatives and teichoic acids (TA) in Gram-positives, both of which play an important factor in surface attachment [8]. For example, TAs were reported to be significant for attachment to plastics and glass found on biomedical devices [16]. Coincidentally, removing TAs in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) through a tarO deletion produced SIPs with reduced attachment strengths across all PEMs compared to the wild type (WT) (Fig 2c). a, The interaction strengths of all twelve test bacteria plotted as a heatmap for SIP comparison. b, The SIPs organized by Gram stain (mean ± SEM). c-f, All SIPs across S. aureus mutants (mean ± SEM). a, The interaction strengths of all twelve test bacteria plotted as a heatmap for SIP comparison. b, The SIPs organized by Gram stain (mean ± SEM). c-f, All SIPs across S. aureus mutants (mean ± SEM). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0327489.g002 SIPs continued to be distinguishable at the species level among the clinically significant pathogens (Fig 2a), with differentiating factors including the average magnitude of interaction strengths across PEMs (average SIP), and the variance of interaction strengths across PEMs (SIP spread). Notably, among these strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosa displayed the highest average SIP, and vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) had the smallest SIP spread. Isolating the exact differences in bacterial surface features that produced the observed shifts in SIP is non-trivial and beyond the scope of this initial study. However, experimental clues suggest that differences in SIPs may not be limited to surface chemistry alone. Within the Gram-negative pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa displayed significantly higher interaction strengths across all PEMs (Fig 1i) and is unique in its expression of flagella. These hairlike appendages confer swimming motility and increase the probability of surface encounters in P. aeruginosa [25,26], likely contributing to its increased average SIP. Examining other surface features and the genes that control them may be as simple as tracking changes in SIP between a set of mutants and their WT. To investigate further, we compared SIPs of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in S. aureus with single-point mutations in the wal operon, a key regulator of the autolysin-encoding genes in cell wall metabolism [27]. The first case study was S. aureus with a single-point mutation in walR, which reduced peptidoglycan recycling and increased the cell wall thickness [20]. This was followed by a subsequent single-point mutation in walK that restored cell wall metabolism and thickness back to approximately WT levels [20]. The walR SIP (Fig 2d) displayed a notable decrease in interaction strength for PEI and PSS and a comparable increase for PDDA, amounting to an overall drop in average SIP compared with the WT. The walK SIP reverted to an approximate WT SIP while preserving the order of PDDA and PEI preference from walR. In our second case study, cell wall thickness was reverted instead by adding the mupGmurQmurP operon encoded on a plasmid (Fig 2e), in effect corroborating the restoration of cell wall metabolism by producing a SIP similar to that of walK. Mutations in the walKR system have been linked to multidrug-resistant pathways in S. aureus [28]. Reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, a last-line antibiotic used to treat serious MRSA infections [29], is primarily associated with modifications to the cell wall peptide sequence that reduce the binding affinity and action of vancomycin [30]. However, vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) isolates have also displayed thicker cell walls analogous to the walR mutant [12]. Coincidentally, the shifts in SIP from MRSA to VISA (Fig 1m) showed a decrease in average SIP and SIP spread, with drops in PEI and PSS interaction strengths similar to those observed in walR (Fig 1k). The more subtle shift in SIP from WT to MRSA (Fig 1m) was not unexpected as the action of methicillin resistance is mainly internal to the cell [31], though minor shifts in wall TA glycosylation have been observed [13]. Very subtle modifications like these could be detectable by improving SIP specificity through an increase in the number and diversity of test surfaces used to provide additional interactions. Regardless, both MRSA and VISA present serious risk factors in clinical settings [32,33] and being able to quickly distinguish between them (and possibly other resistant mutants) in tandem with bacterial identification presents an unignorable clinical potential for SIPs. In principle, we could determine the identity of an unknown pathogen by matching its SIP to one in a library of pre-measured SIPs. This library would be generated and continuously updated by measuring and compiling the SIPs of all current and new clinically relevant bacterial pathogens and antibiotic-resistant mutants using an optimized protocol developed for a future SIP-based diagnostic. To explore further, three test pathogens were randomly selected, their suspensions prepared blind, and their SIPs measured. We were able to successfully identify each blind test pathogen by comparing and matching SIPs (Fig 3a): i) Enterococcus faecalis, ii) Acinetobacter baumannii, and iii) Klebsiella pneumoniae. The attachment curves and interaction strength values between the blind test pathogens and their correctly identified clinically relevant strain counterparts displayed significant agreement across PEMs (Fig 3b) and were the highest percent matching pairs among all possible SIPs (S2 Table). a, All clinically significant pathogen and blind test pathogen SIPs are plotted as a heat map. b, The bacterial-surface attachment curves (surface-adhered cell counts plotted against suspension optical densities) of blind pathogens i, ii, and iii compared with their correctly identified counterparts E. faecalis, A. baumannii, and K. pneumoniae, respectively (mean ± SEM). a, All clinically significant pathogen and blind test pathogen SIPs are plotted as a heat map. b, The bacterial-surface attachment curves (surface-adhered cell counts plotted against suspension optical densities) of blind pathogens i, ii, and iii compared with their correctly identified counterparts E. faecalis, A. baumannii, and K. pneumoniae, respectively (mean ± SEM). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0327489.g003 Herein, we introduced a novel technique capable of rapidly differentiating a set of bacteria through their surface interactions, utilizing a quick 10-minute interaction period and only three probing surfaces. By comparing our first-generation SIPs, we were able to successfully distinguish between clinically significant pathogens from Gram stain to individual species. Furthermore, we confirmed the restoration of cell wall metabolism via tracking and comparing SIPs between a series of S. aureus mutants in the walKR system, broadening the scope and utility of this technique. Lastly, an early glance at its predictive capabilities combined with distinguishing single- and multidrug-resistant forms of S. aureus underscored its clinical relevance and future diagnostic potential in combining pathogen identification and AST under a single, rapid, low-cost test.

Eurobike 2025 swung open its doors to welcome the cycling industry into its new-as-of-a-few-years home in Frankfurt, where the usual assortment of weird and wonderful products awaited the eager eyes - and cameras - of the world's cycling media. Our intrepid trade show reporter Andi Sykes scoured the fairground halls for us in search of novel and newsworthy items, and this is what he came back with. Dive in! Stablead is a new name to the MTB scene. The company is better known for tripods and gimbals and hopes to bring some of their expertise in those fields to the MTB world. The bike Stablead had on display isn’t intended to be released but show off their manufacturing technologies and also display some of their products which include front and rear suspension, pedals, stems and more. This unnamed upside down fork will be released next year. It will be aimed at enduro riders with around 160-170mm of travel. The upper leg and steerer assembly is one piece to reduce weight, but make sure you get your steerer length correct before cutting! To compliment their fork, Stablead also had this rear shock with carbon canister. Details are thin, but from the sample on display we can see this air shock will feature rebound, compression adjustments, an adjustable bladder and have a lock out lever. On top of carbon parts, Stablead had a range of alloy products on display, all of which should be available from July this year. As well as various stems with a removable faceplate, they had this wrap around design and also a direct mount stem too. Their CNC machined chain sets are made from 7075 alloy with a hard-anodized finished and will be available in 155-175mm lengths at 5mm increments. The chainring is also a Stablead product. There were also 2 flat pedal designs, this thinner model being the more attractive and possibly lighter version (they were fastened down and there were not weight details on display). Again these are machined from 7075 alloy with a hard-anodized finish. I was able to pick this one up and it did feel quite hefty in the hand, but it also felt extremely burly too. I don’t think I’d be worry about clipping a few rocks with these. 32-inch wheels was one of the trends of the show, and this prototype ‘Big Ben’ bikes was used on the Maxxis stand to show off their new big hoops. It was made using machined alloy lugs with tubing bonded into place. The linkage included details of the suspension from the amount of travel (120mm) to the progressively of the kinematic. I suppose other links are available to quickly make changes to the ride. Like it or not, but 32-inch tires are here. It currently looks like it’s being aimed at the XC crowd, but perhaps the introduction of all these new USD forks means we can expect 32-inch wheels and tires to move in to Trail, Enduro and possibly even Downhill? Nukeproof were back at the show under their new owners Belgian Cycling Factory. On display was this prototype Dissent DH bike with a custom rear end. Not many details on this, but the front triangle is a stock Dissent where as the rear has been updated to alter the kinematics. Interestingly the pivots all use Ceramic Speed Bearings which is something usually you see in high-end hubs. A new version of the Nukeproof Reactor was on show. This was actually designed and developed by the original Nukeproof team before the company went under, but the new owners are bringing it back. The updated front triangle now has a flip chip to run either 29" or MX wheels. You all knew it was coming! Here’s the first of around 14 DJI powered bikes spotted at Eurobike 2025. The Commencal Meta SX DJI won’t be available until Spring 2026, but it was quite clearly a show favorite. The Meta SX DJI runs 160mm travel, comes as a mullet only and all sizes but the small have an 800Wh battery. This Eurobike actually marked the first time in many years that Commencal attended. This is NOT a Cotic! This is a Heintz titanium full suspension trail bike spotted in the handmade area of the show. While it might look similar and use a suspension lay-out similar to Cotic’s Drop Link, the builder had made a few changes such as internal cable routing with full internal titanium guides, and a switch to a Horst link rather than the link on the seat stay found on the UK bikes. Also found in the handmade area of the show was the new Orange Phase Evo, the brand's first ever DJI bike and the first DJI bike that is handmade in the UK. The Phase Evo runs around 160mm of travel on Orange’s traditional single pivot suspension layout. The bike uses a new construction design for the downtube where either a 600Wh or 800Wh battery can be fitted. Orange thinks weights could be as low as 20kg. Also spotted on the Orange were HUNT’s latest enduro wheel set the Enduro V3. These alloy wheels feature FEA developed front and rear specific rims and HUNT’s new 40t ratchet free hub design. As ridden by The Firm, T-Mac and many more! Spanish brand Abums had their steel E-MTB on display. This was one of the launch models of the new Mahle E-MTB system and is apparently the world’s first steel electric mountain bike with an integrated battery. Sometimes the greatest finds at Eurobike are the ones you bump into while walking between halls and that is exactly how I came across this one! Handmade in Germany, this is the Truebc trail bike boasting an integrated 8 Pins dropper post and mid pivot suspension layout. Truebc is better known for making carbon components such as MTB rims and gravel parts, but they decided to branch out with frame production. Rather than going for something simple for their first frame they went for a beautifully executed full suspension frame with really neat features. I especially liked the external cable and hose routing that is hidden with a neat carbon cover giving the aesthetic of internal routing but the simplicity of external. Teewing had their Turbo Force carbon trail bike on display at the show. While new to the MTB market, this Chinese brand was one of the brands that made up the 2nd wave of DJI Avinox E-MTB launches earlier in the year. Remember this name because they may soon have an Enduro bike on sale. Rotwild doesn’t have the same brand recognition in the UK as it once did, but in Germany they are still well known for high quality bikes and smart engineering. The new REX E-MTB has a (surprise surprise) DJI Avinox motor, a 4-bar, high pivot suspension layout, 8 Pins integrated dropper and 150mm of travel. But its party trick is the custom carbon battery that is not only larger than a standard Avinox battery but also easily removable. Most DJI bikes require the motor to be dropped to access the battery, but the Rotwild battery slots in to the downtube and can be easily removed and swapped out. Not that it will need much swapping as it is a larger 875Wh battery. Head is better known as a tennis or ski brand but they do also make mountain bikes and this Enduro bike has been something I’ve wanted to see for a while. It’s not listed on the official Head website (at the time of writing) but their social channels have been promoting it for a few months already. The alloy frame has a huge amount of stand over clearance, there’s a modern mid-pivot suspension design with an idler, and there is an interesting choice of components too. Head even have athletes competing on this bike at enduro races in Europe now! But I feel they could have come up with a better name than ‘Downey’. Steppenwolf had a couple of DJI-powered bikes, but it was the newly launched Tundra 11.0 that caught my attention. This 170mm travel enduro bike had an interesting rear suspension layout that, rumor has it, was developed with some input from Unno. Prime Bikes had their entire range of bikes on show at Eurobike 2025, but it was this unreleased trail bike that stole the show for them. The 140mm travel bike runs on 29-inch wheels and showcases the same level of fit and finish we’ve come to expect from Prime. The bike is so new that it isn’t even named yet! There was even a competition running to figure out what it should be called. What would you name it? Let us know in the comments below! Crussis, a Czech mountain bike brand released a whole host of DJI bikes prior to Eurobike. Everything from alloy hardtails all the way up to carbon trail and enduro full suspension bikes! Not only do they have a massive range of models but individual build options and then even an option to fit either a 600Wh or 800Wh battery. It sounds like a merchandising nightmare... Their prices are impressive with an alloy DJI full suspension bike costing as little as €4500. Not this one though, this one is the flagship model with wireless Fox Neo components and the new Podium fork, costing around €11,000. At a show with DJI-powered bikes from the likes of Commencal and Unno, you’re going to want to show something really impressive to stand out. Unfortunately this Kross E Trail DJI bike feels really underwhelming compared to the competition. Polygon had this new trail version of the Collosus on display. The full carbon Collosus T9 promises to be an ‘aggressive trail machine’ and uses their tried and tested IFS suspension platform tuned to offer better small bump sensitivity. The Indonesian brand also had a new XC bike to show the crowds. The Syncline DR is aimed at riders who want to go fast uphill under their own steam and is decked out with RockShox Flight Attendant suspension and a power meter as standard. Please KTM make a downcountry/trail version of this! It looks amazing! One of the most interesting products at the show, and one that I am itching to get my hands on is this EXA Form F36 fork from Kindshock. I spotted this at China Cycle but KS confirmed that this would also be available aftermarket! It will feature an open bath design, with rebound and compression adjustment and uses an air spring. The model on show had 170mm travel and the action (just pushing by hand) felt very smooth with zero breakaway stiction. The most impressive part though is the price, at roughly €400 retail. Sign me up! Kindshock also had their new Rage Circuit wireless dropper on display. The current version has a max drop of 180mm but a 210mm version is in the works too. What’s neat about this is that there is an emergency button on top of the post, so if the battery in the shifter does die mid-ride you can still drop and raise your post. Again impressive pricing, as this will retail at just €399. Maxon were showing off their new motor system and a couple of bikes that are already ready to go on sale. The Maxon Air S weighs just 2kg and produces 90Nm torque and 650W peak power. Not quite as much as other motors, but less power means less battery drain, meaning smaller batteries and a lower weight. Maxon had a couple of bikes on show with their new motor system including this rather nice 145mm travel trail bike from Instictiv. They are also working with smaller brands to allow them to enter the E-MTB market without the risk of high MOQ’s (Minimum Order Quantity) that other manufacturers demand. 2025 might be the year of 32-inch wheels but while Maxxis might be looking at ways to save a few seconds here and their for XC racers, DirtySixer offers 32-inch wheels for larger riders, who need much bigger frames, wheels and... ...pedals! If 32-inch is too small then what about this 36-inch full suspension bike! Even Gary Fisher is shocked to see it! And the final find of the show was this near production ready version of the Velduro Rogue. We first saw this as a 3D-printed sample at the China Cycle Show, but this is a ready to ride and test bike. Velduro is hoping to open pre-orders for their Rogue later in the year. Words and photos by Andi Sykes Surely the as-yet-unnamed Prime bike should be called “Optimus”? Unless I'm missing something the Rotwild is not really a high pivot bike... As for the Steppenwolf, stuff of nightmares incarnated for @seanfisseli ? Lol! I hope I’m in on the joke but I’ll take it! In reply to Unless I'm missing something… by Primoz The Polygon Collosus T uses a VPP linkage (which Polygon calls "IFS Compact") Dear lord!The seat tube angle on that pink Dirtysixer!!! 🤮 woah does this mean Instinctiv is changing their frames to a more palatable shape (read: no egregiously bent top-tube) I am more shocked that it looks nothing like an ebike. In reply to woah does this mean… by LookinForIt Hello Vital MTB Visitor, We’re conducting a survey and would appreciate your input.

Title: Mid-Year Outlook: Stocks Back At Highs
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/06/29/mid-year-outlook-stocks-back-at-highs/
Time Published: 2025-06-29T11:00:00Z

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. With stocks reaching a new high just as the midpoint of the year is reached, it is an opportune time ... More to look at what the second half of the year might hold. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. The boost from technology and artificial intelligence-related companies was also notably in the rebound. With stocks reaching a new high just as the midpoint of the year is reached, it is an opportune time to look at what the second half of the year might hold. Rather than the traditional outlook, this will be an examination of the risks versus rewards, considering what is currently priced in financial markets. The massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%, with stocks dragged lower in expectation of lower earnings. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. The recent 12-day military conflict between Israel and Iran caused concerns about an economically unfriendly oil shock. Still, the US bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities has led to a ceasefire, which has cooled fears. Stocks & Recession Odds The betting odds of recession also tell much of the story about the US 10-year Treasury note yield. Yields fell as fears of an economic downturn rose and have since recovered from the lows, as economic risk appears to have waned. There is more to the story here, as signs suggest that bond markets worldwide are less willing to fund the unfavorable fiscal situations of most countries. Yields & Recession Odds Stocks soared last week on the ceasefire in the Israel-Iran war and the agreement around a framework for US-China trade. The S&P 500 surpassed its mid-February high by 0.5% after having declined by almost 20%. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has recovered to only 4% below its mid-December level after being as much as 30% under the peak. Apart from the good news on trade and Iran, the strength in US bank stocks was notable. Last week, the annual Federal Reserve (Fed) stress tests for large banks were better than expected. Additionally, the Fed made some changes to the methodology, which are expected to result in fewer Stress Capital Buffers (SCBs) being required for banks in the future. All other things being equal, less need for capital buffers means better profitability. Market Returns The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have outperformed less economically impacted defensives since stocks bottomed, marking the peak of recession fears. The current situation is back to pricing in a benign, if not downright optimistic, economic backdrop. Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive Stocks Based on the current 24.3 times current earnings and 23.4 times multiple of 2025 estimated earnings, also known as the forward price-to-earnings ratio, stocks do not look cheap relative to the past. However, historically, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has been correlated with return-on-equity (ROE), which measures how efficiently companies generate profits from the capital provided by their shareholders. Although the ROE is down from its recent highs, it remains above average, which argues for an above-average P/E ratio, assuming this elevated ROE is sustainable. Consensus estimates project a return on equity of 18.6% in 2025 and 19.4% in 2026, up from 17.6% in 2024. To provide perspective, the S&P 500’s ROE was 15.1% in 2019 before the pandemic. S&P 500: Price-To-Earnings & ROE The composition of the large-cap US stock market is crucial to this improved outlook for ROE since much of the boost has come from technology and artificial intelligence-related companies. Even a simple analysis of the S&P 500 shows that at least 43% of the market capitalization is related to these two areas. Weights In S&P 500 As noted earlier, the exceptional return on equity supports the rich stock valuations, and profit margins are elevated relative to historical levels. Profit margins measure the percentage of top-line sales that are converted into bottom-line profits. As a business owner, higher profit margins, all other things being equal, are more valuable. Notably, the profit margins for the technology sector are almost twice the market. In addition, according to FactSet, technology sector earnings are expected to grow at 18% in 2025, while the S&P 500’s earnings are forecast to rise by about 9.1% year-over-year. S&P 500: Profitability According to Warren Buffett, “The value of a business is the cash it’s going to produce in the future, discounted back to the present.” Free cash flow measures the cash left over after a company supports its operations and maintains or invests further in its business. Thus, free cash flow provides a good measure of the money accruing to shareholders as owners. The free cash flow yield is calculated by dividing the free cash flow by the stock price. Consistent with the price-to-earnings ratio, the cash flow yield suggests that the stock market is not currently cheap, although it has been more expensive at times in the past. This metric assumes that free cash flow remains static, so it can also be interpreted as indicating that investors have more confidence that free cash flow will continue to grow. Indeed, investors should be willing to pay more for a company in which one can have high confidence that the corporate profits accruing to owners will continue to grow. As a subset of the S&P 500, technology stocks are priced at an even lower free cash flow yield. This valuation premium reflects the optimism about the future of many of these companies and the superior fundamentals of the group as a whole. The profit margins and earnings growth rate for the technology sector have been exceptional, which helps explain the premium valuation assigned by the lower free cash flow yield. One additional wrinkle is the massive capital spending (capex) that Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) are investing in artificial intelligence infrastructure. This spending is also depressing the current free cash flow yield for the technology-related stocks on the margin. Massive capital expenditure (capex) spending is often viewed as a red flag for investors, who are typically concerned that the substantial investment will not yield a sufficient return for the companies. However, these four companies are currently being given the benefit of the doubt. S&P 500: Free Cash Flow Yield The main event of the holiday-shortened trading week will be the monthly jobs report on Thursday. Economists expect June’s gain in nonfarm payrolls to slow to 113,000 from 139,000 in May. Notably, the unemployment rate is expected to rise to 4.3% from 4.2%. US Unemployment Rate Given the upward trend in weekly continuing claims for unemployment benefits, the expected uptick in unemployment is a reasonable assumption. The upward trend indicates that the job market has been softening as it is taking longer for those losing their jobs to get a new one. With expectations for the US economy rebounding and the risk of recession decreasing, the resilience of the labor market should be closely monitored. Continuing Claims For Unemployment Benefits Markets currently expect at least two 25-basis-point (0.25%) Fed cuts in 2025, consistent with the median Fed projection. There is a slight chance of a cut in July, but the first move lower in 2025 is fully priced for September. Fed Rate Cuts Expected In the wake of the rebound from the tariff-induced bear market decline in stocks, investors should revisit their risk tolerance, as the robust stock rally over the last couple of years has likely increased their allocation to risk assets. Rebalancing stock and bond allocations toward the target risk level is wise for many investors, especially given the ongoing presence of tariff, geopolitical, and fiscal risks. The key to successful long-term stock investing is staying invested during the inevitable tough times, as rebounds from those bear markets are typically massive and unpredictable in timing, as illustrated by the first half of this year. Stocks are priced for a benign economic outcome and some support from the Federal Reserve in lowering interest rates. Improving corporate profitability, with 9% earnings growth in 2025 and 14% in 2026, is forecasted to normalize currently elevated valuations. This outcome is certainly possible, if not the most probable, but investors should be mindful that the hurdles at these valuation levels are higher. The artificial intelligence wave is a real phenomenon as adoption continues, so the optimistic scenario is not entirely out of the realm of possibility. This optimism should be tempered by the fact that the economy and earnings can always disappoint, especially if the trade war heats up again; therefore, investors should be prepared for possible turbulence. Disclosure: Glenview Trust may hold stocks mentioned in this article within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: Meta’s Xbox-Branded Quest 3S Just Sold Out for All the Wrong Reasons

Everyone loves limited-edition stuff. There’s Sony’s 30th anniversary PS5, or Analogue’s many limited edition Pocket handhelds, orâ I don’t knowâthe Shamrock f***ing Shake. But there’s one type of person who loves limited-edition stuff more than your average consumer, and it’s a scalper. For proof of that, see Meta’s recently released Xbox-branded Quest 3S. See Meta Quest Xbox Edition at Best Buy In case you missed it, Meta’s new limited-edition Quest 3S bundle just recently sold out, which on the surface sounds like a great thing for VR and XR. You may be tempted to say, “Oh, wow! People really like XR headsets, huh?” But before you do that, it may also be worth taking a short gander at eBay, because the resale market over there paints a slightly more cynical picture. It’s fullÂ of Xbox-branded Quest 3S bundles, folksâand they ain’t just giving them away. This bundle, for reference, retails at $399, and the average price I’m seeing on eBay is about $600, though sometimes a little more or a little less. Here is the sad state of affairs on eBay as of the time of typing these words: The list goes on and on, unfortunately, which tells me one thing: the scalpers had a field day with this thing. And that’s just kind of sad. It’s not sad that someone would want to make money from reselling a limited-edition gadgetâas annoying as scalpers are, I can’t blame anyone for having a side hustle in this economy. But it is sad that Meta seemingly didn’t do much to preserve its limited-edition Quest 3S for XR nerds who unequivocally deserve first dibs. It’s also maybe a little sadâas someone who borders on said XR nerd identityâthat the race to being out of stock may not actually be driven by real demand. XR headsets, while not the most crucial gadget in the world, are pretty cool and deserve more shine than they get, in my humble opinion. It would have been nice to see them really break through with a little help from an Xbox marketing gimmick. But as always, the almighty aftermarket prevails. To be fair, I’m sure not all of the sales were scalpers trying to make a buck off the XR headset’s rarity. Some people, I presume, bought it because it’s a pretty good deal for getting into XRâyou get a sleek black headset with Xbox green details, Meta’s Elite Strap for your head, and a limited-edition Xbox controller to top it off. Based on the retail price of all of that, this bundle saves you somewhere in the ballpark of $95. Some people bought this bundle because of Xbox, too. Here’s one instance in which someone seems to have pulled the trigger on this bundle just for the controller. Honestly… respect. That’s much more pure than trying to spin the whole thing around for $200. The idea that someone buys the new Quest colorway just to nab the limited edition Xbox Controller and sell the rest is really comical.. pic.twitter.com/b5ER1xIfqe — SadlyItsDadley (@SadlyItsBradley) June 27, 2025 Listen, scalpers are an inevitable fact of life nowadays when you’re buying any gadget that’s even slightly in demand. Like it or not, that’s just the world we live inâone colored by bots and dropshipping. But I’d be lying if I said that it wouldn’t have been nice to see a little effort on Meta’s part to prevent that. It can be done! Just look at the Switch 2 launch. People have been resorting to cartoonish levels of robbery to get their hands on itâthat’s how in-demand this thing isâbut Nintendo, with a little bit of forethought, has kept the scourge of scalpers to a dull roar. I guess Meta probably doesn’t care that much either way, though. A sale is a sale, whether it ends up on eBay or on your dorky XR- and Xbox-loving head. Sadly, if you’re in the latter camp, it looks like the aftermarket is your only option right now. Thanks, Zuckerberg. Just because you look like a dropshipper doesn’t mean you have to act like one.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, June 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) and reminds investors of the July 21, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify's stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding DoubleVerify’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / JUNE 28 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform.

His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare.
