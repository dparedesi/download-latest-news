Title: Why Sam Altman Won't Be on the Hook for OpenAI's Spending Spree

Over the last few months, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has been on a tear of dealmaking, announcing multibillion dollar agreements with the biggest tech companies in the world. There’s Oracle, Nvidia, Microsoft, AMD, Broadcom, and most recently, Amazon. He’s committed to spending a grand sum total of $1.4 trillion on datacenters in the coming years — an eyebrow-raising figure for a company which claims its annual revenue is projected to reach $20 billion this year, begging an all-important question for the entire tech industry, whose fate is now tied to OpenAI: What happens if he can’t pay? At an event this week, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar seemed to suggest that the government could act as a “backstop” for the company’s commitments — comments she later walked back. And in a long-winded post on X, Altman addressed the question of what happens to OpenAI if its web of deals falls apart: “If we screw up and can’t fix it, we should fail, and other companies will continue on doing good work and servicing customers,” Altman said. “...We of course could be wrong, and the market—not the government—will deal with it if we are.” The odds don’t look great right now. In order to come through on its compute commitments, OpenAI’s revenue would have to grow to an estimated $577 billion by 2029, roughly the size of Google’s revenue that same year, Tomasz Tunguz, a general partner at Theory Ventures, wrote in a recent blog post. That’s a roughly 2900% jump from its current projections for 2025. But OpenAI has options. One likely scenario is that the AI company pays for and utilizes only a portion of the compute it has booked, said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria. In that case, companies like Oracle, Amazon, Microsoft, CoreWeave and others will most likely renegotiate the contracts and ensure they get at least some amount of business from OpenAI, especially if the alternative is getting none at all. “They don't want OpenAI to go bankrupt, so their incentive is to renegotiate,” he told Forbes. “He’s taking all this commitment knowing that he's not going to actually face any consequences because he doesn't have a financial stake.” Renegotiating contracts isn’t uncommon in the data center world. These contracts are extremely complex and often spread out over a span of years; some parties can even further extend timelines in case companies aren’t able to meet commitments. Clients like OpenAI are typically billed on the basis of usage. The “big numbers” being announced are often larger than what’s actually committed under contract, largely due to variables like share price, data center construction cost and GPU price, data center expert Daniel Golding said. For instance, OpenAI has committed to buy up to 6 GW of AMD’s chips (estimated to be worth around $90 billion) in exchange for about 10% of AMD shares—no cash on either side. But that hinges on performance milestones for OpenAI’s technology and commercial business as well as AMD’s share price. The contracts often have some capital I ifs. Thanks to constraints on power supply and chip availability, there’s a possibility that some of these infrastructure providers aren’t able to deliver in time, another opportunity for OpenAI to weasel out of paying some of the top line number. OpenAI’s $22.4 billion in total contracts with CoreWeave, for instance, can be terminated by either party at any time “for cause” (legal speak for things like delays). But even with about a trillion dollars on the line, the bigger risk in Altman’s mind is not having access to enough cheap compute to train and run better AI models when the time comes— a move that is crucial for revenue growth. “We believe the risk to OpenAI of not having enough computing power is more significant and more likely than the risk of having too much,” he said, adding that the company is also exploring ways to sell compute to other companies directly, much like CoreWeave does. When reached for comment, OpenAI spokesperson Steve Sharpe said the company has “nothing to add.” Altman’s fixation on grabbing as much gargantuan compute as he can is not surprising. He has always knelt at the altar of scaling laws. Earlier this year, Altman mused on the coming of AGI, or artificial general intelligence, the company’s overarching goal of creating AI that matches or surpasses human capabilities. “The intelligence of an AI model roughly equals the log of the resources used to train and run it,” he wrote, noting you could get “continuous and predictable gains” from pumping money into those resources. “The scaling laws that predict this are accurate over many orders of magnitude,” he wrote. Even before ChatGPT was released, he told employees at his crypto-cum-identity company Worldcoin (now called World), that one of his personal operating principles is “scale it up and see what happens,” something he’s found effective with everything from large neural networks to fusion reactors, Forbes reported. And the faster the better. Scaling up “earlier than it makes sense to … is super, super valuable,” he told Worldcoin employees. “The math that Mr. Altman is doing in his head is ‘they need me more than I need them.’” Experts note chief dealmaker Altman doesn’t have anything to lose. He has repeatedly claimed he does not have a stake in the company, and won’t have a stake even after OpenAI has restructured to become a public benefit corporation. “He has the upside, in a sense, in terms of influence, if it all succeeds,” said Ofer Eldar, a corporate governance professor at the UC Berkeley School of Law. “He's taking all this commitment knowing that he's not going to actually face any consequences because he doesn't have a financial stake.” That’s not good corporate governance, according to Jo-Ellen Pozner, a professor of management and entrepreneurship at Santa Clara University’s Leavey School of Business. “We allow leaders that we see as being super pioneering to behave idiosyncratically, and when things move in the opposite direction and somebody has to pay, it's unclear that they're the ones that are going to have to pay,” she said. Luria adds: “He can commit to as much as he wants. He can commit to a trillion dollars, ten trillion, a hundred trillion dollars. It doesn't matter. Either he uses it, he renegotiates it, or he walks away.” There are of course more indirect stakes for Altman, experts said, like the reputational blow he’d take if the deals fall apart. But on paper, he’d seemingly be off the hook, they said. As OpenAI has grown in prominence, tech giants have clamored to strike deals with the AI behemoth. “More of the world wants to work with us, so deals are quicker to negotiate,” Altman said recently. And they’ve reaped the upsides: Oracle, Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom gained a collective $636 billion in market cap on the days their deals were announced. Most recently, when OpenAI announced a $38 billion AI infrastructure deal with Amazon on Monday, the company’s stock increased 4%, adding $10 billion to Jeff Bezos’ net worth. “The math that Mr. Altman is doing in his head is ‘they need me more than I need them,’” Luria said. Companies involved in these circular deals have already indicated they’re willing to bail each other out. In September, Nvidia said it would buy CoreWeave’s unsold computing capacity through 2032, initially worth $6.3 billion. Presumably, that could expand to include anything OpenAI doesn’t use given that it’s CoreWeave’s largest customer. “If you owe the bank a hundred thousand dollars, the bank owns you. If you owe the bank a hundred million dollars, you own the bank,” said Lloyd Walmsley, a Mizuho analyst who covers Meta, Google and Amazon. “ Everyone's holding hands and, and having this leap of faith that the products are so powerful.” It’s also possible that OpenAI uses all the compute it has booked, and needs more. In that case, the AI titan will need to raise more funding—either through private or public markets—and increase its revenue exponentially. Part of why Altman has spoken about a potential OpenAI IPO is that it would make raising cheaper debt much easier. Altman said on Thursday that he’s confident that revenue will continue to grow, primarily from upcoming enterprise products and categories like robotics and consumer devices. Then, take the extreme case. If OpenAI were to file for bankruptcy protection, who would get paid first? Who would, in Sam Altman’s words, “get burnt”? For one, it’s entirely possible that some cash-rich company, perhaps one on the other end of one of its big contracts like Microsoft or Oracle, buys it in a fire sale. In the very unlikely event OpenAI goes bankrupt and liquidates instead, debtholders would get their money back first. Then equity investors, and finally—if there’s anything left over—common shareholders. OpenAI has only announced one debt deal so far, a $4 billion credit facility with nine banks including JPMorgan, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The company announced the loan in October 2024 and said it is a revolving credit facility (akin to a giant corporate credit card). It’s unclear if OpenAI has additional debt, which it isn’t required to disclose as a private company. “If you owe the bank a hundred thousand dollars, the bank owns you. If you owe the bank a hundred million dollars, you own the bank.” King among OpenAI’s equity holders is Microsoft, which owns 27% of the company following OpenAI’s restructuring as a for-profit company last week. Microsoft has invested $11.6 billion of its $13 billion commitment to OpenAI, and OpenAI has committed to purchase $250 billion of Microsoft Azure’s compute services over the coming years. The companies have two-way plans to share revenue. “Of the dominoes that are going to fall when OpenAI can't pay everybody [and the question arises of] who gets paid first, and I'd argue that Microsoft gets paid first,” Luria added. Other large shareholders include Thrive, SoftBank, Dragoneer and investors in the $6 billion merger between Jony Ive’s io and OpenAI. Common shareholders—employees, cofounders and the nonprofit—would get what’s left, proportionally to how much they paid for their shares. Interestingly, OpenAI’s nonprofit holds a special “Class N” common share, which gives it majority voting and veto power in elections of board directors, though that share isn’t entitled to any financial return if the company were to go under. (The nonprofit’s 26% stake likely also includes ordinary common shares.) Altman’s wheeling and dealing is nothing short of mind-boggling, though many of the biggest payments aren’t due for a few years. In the AI universe, that’s plenty of time to figure out how he’s going to pay for it all, whether it’s additional fundraising or explosive revenue growth. Seems like nobody knows the answer just yet, not even him.

The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite is a step above its competitors in every respect, including price. This monster $599 headset literally does it all. Simultaneous audio between two USB-C sources, 3.5mm, and Bluetooth, support for literally every gaming platform, premium materials, ANC, 30-hour swappable batteries, a desktop digital audio controller, and superb audio. The only issues amount to minor nitpicks, but you're going to need to really, REALLY want those extra features to justify that sky-high price tag. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite is the best headset I've ever reviewed. Top shelf build quality and comfort Industry-leading device versatility Immaculate, peerless audio Retractable mic with ANC Handy DAC with great features Monster battery life Premium specs means premium price Software is a bit slow and could be improved Materials make it a fingerprint magnet Why you can trust Windows Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. $599.99. That's how much the latest effort from SteelSeries will set you back. And it's a price tag that's impossible to overlook. This is the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite. It joins other products that share the "Elite" branding, such as the Xbox Elite Controller, targeting users on the high end. Gamers span all sorts of purchasing power capabilities these days, and companies know it. For those with cash to burn, building products that can seemingly do everything while also sporting the most premium materials is a segment manufacturers are increasingly targeting. The Arctis Nova Elite unashamedly joins that market as the best Xbox headset for pure, decadent luxury. As a humble games blogger, I'm not sure there's a universe where I would (or even could) ever pay $599.99 for a headset, practically under any circumstances — but if I could afford it, it would absolutely be for this headset. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite is undeniably the most luxurious gaming headset I have ever used, whose features and quality inarguably justify that sky-high price tag. But you're going to be a very specific type of gamer to want to buy in here. This review was made possible thanks to a review sample provided by SteelSeries. The company had no input nor saw the contents of this review prior to publication. For over a decade, I've been reviewing headsets of all shapes and sizes. I've tried earbuds, budget gaming headsets, and premium cans for enthusiasts. I keep all of the headsets I review for active comparisons, and could probably open my own headset store if this tech blogging lark ever folds. One thing that won't fold is my enthusiasm for recommending YOU the best Xbox and PC headsets for your use cases. As for this headset, I've also been using the previous Arctis Nova as my daily driver. How does this one compare? Read on. You know the price already. It's a beefy boy, but what about the specs to match it? Let's take a look. This is premium from every angle you look. This is a hi-res certified headset, which means it's verified by independent organizations as being able to deliver sound beyond a typical CD. This is 24-bit/96 kHz signals specifically, and to do that, requires a higher grade of engineering and materials. As far as I could tell, this is the first wireless gaming headset to achieve this standard — a level typically reserved for audiophile products and studio-grade gear. Category Arctis Nova Pro Elite Drivers 40mm carbon fiber drivers with brass surrounds Frequency response 10 Hz – 40 kHz (Hi-Res certified) Connectivity Dual USB-C, 2.4 GHz wireless, 3.5mm line-in, Bluetooth Microphone Retractable and beamforming internal retracted modes Battery system Dual hot-swappable batteries (30~ hours x2) Build materials Steel headband, aluminum hinges, premium leatherette cushions Weight ~350 g Compatibility PC, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, Xbox (via DAC), mobile (via Bluetooth) Special features Hi-Res Wireless certification, AI mic noise reduction, EQ software, ANC options, full DAC with multi-platform connectivity, simultaneous audio source mixing Price (RRP) $559.99 USD It's not all about hi-res certification here, though. While premium materials definitely had a role to play here, this headset also boasts some of the most impressive versatility we've ever seen in a gaming headset. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. The Arctis Nova Elite's powerful digital audio controller looks unassuming on your desk, but it boasts monstrous capabilities. It's your platform for hot-swapping and keeping batteries charged up (with each of the 2 included cells offering up to 30 hours of playback). It also lets you mix audio signals from four different sources: two USB-C, one 3.5mm line-in, and one Bluetooth 5.3. This is the first headset that has offered the ability to mix Xbox, PS5, and PC audio simultaneously since SPDIF fell out of fashion as a result — something game streamers using consoles and capture cards might appreciate. Even the packaging is premium here, as SteelSeries guns for the audiophile and enthusiast gamer segment. It's as expensive as some Xbox Series X and PS5 models at $599.99, and it seems to have good stock levels across the board as of writing. Does the Arctis Nova Elite stick the landing? Absolutely yes, in (almost) every regard. And luckily, the parts that could be improved are software in nature and can be updated. Here are more details on the experience. When I opened up the package to this headset, I immediately knew I was about to experience something special. This is by far and away the most expensive headset I have ever reviewed, and its premium presentation will immediately command your attention. The packaging is accented in gold and comes in a sort of monolithic box as if it had descended from another planet. The Arctis Nova Elite sports a familiar design if you've seen the predecessor Arctis Nova Pro (my previous primary driver here), complete with a retractable mic, detachable magnetic side-plates housing USB-C connectivity and the battery bay, as well as a floating headband. What sets it apart is that every aspect of it is dialled up to 11. Various parts of the headset that were plastic in other models are now metal, including the textured volume dial and adjustable hinges on either side. The dials, buttons, and materials all sport a very luxurious feel. Various parts of the headset that were plastic in other models are now metal, including the textured volume dial and adjustable hinges on either side. The leatherette earcups feel incredibly comfortable, and dare I say, dreamy on the skin, easily defeating fabric-clad rivals. The floating headband is also an easy win for long, long periods of use, and retains SteelSeries' tradition for cranial comfort. One weird downside of the floating headband is that it's easy to rock the headset off your head if you get a little too immersed in the music (and immersed you will, the sound delivery on this headset is immense). It's designed for long gaming sessions at the end of the day, but it's worth being aware of. Returning is the retractable boom microphone, which now cleverly has per-configuration settings. When you retract it, you can still use it for calls, and it'll beamform your voice similar to earbuds. When you extend it, it functions as a high-quality mic for comms and potentially even light content creation. I'm not sure I'd record a full YouTube video on this mic over my Elgato XLR, but it's up there with the best gaming headset mics I've used. Indeed, the ability to retract the mic and fall back to Bluetooth 5.3 gives you lifestyle usability here that many other "gaming" headsets don't really offer. The subtle design on the black model means it won't look out of place when used during commutes or on a plane, and there's even an alternative colorway that fits a more Apple-style grey fashion aesthetic, too. The only criticism I'd offer here from a "lifestyle" perspective is that, perhaps, the logos are a bit "loud" for this type of use case. There are after-market sideplates you can buy that look a little more subtle, though, or even louder ones if you prefer. The World of Warcraft Horde ones are out of stock, though (dang.) Also, the soft-touch plastics SteelSeries opted for here tend to be fingerprint magnets too, which isn't a big deal, but on the black model, it can be pretty noticeable. When you're knee deep in corpses in a Battlefield 6 map or rocking to Nirvana while writing a gaming headset review on the internet (meta), you're likely not thinking about the side plates or fingerprints, though. How's the audio? It's fan-expletive-tastic. Let's not beat around the bush here. The Arctis Nova Elite is the most immaculate audio experience I've had in over a decade of gaming headset reviews. I put them directly head-to-head with a family member's studio-grade Beyerdynamic DT 1990 PRO and was quite stunned to find the experience pleasantly comparable. This is a gaming headset, but I've found myself using it primarily for music over the past few weeks. Rediscovering new details in soundscapes I know very well has been incredibly fun with this product, as someone who generally uses earbuds or other random gaming headsets for music typically. No other headset I've used allows for this absurd level of versatility and freedom. There's no distortion, no glitching, no artifacting, no muddiness, no range is overbearing or under-represented — it's simply hard to go back to anything else after using these. ANC helps eliminate background noise on planes, trains, and buses, and easy on-ear controls and a solid mobile app make them a winner for commuters. Indeed, you have multiple ways to connect to this headset, too. As noted, the digital audio controller will sit at your desk and politely allow you to connect up not one, but actually three sound sources, on top of a fourth Bluetooth signal directly into the headset. And yes, you can mix them all simultaneously. No other headset I've used allows for this absurd level of versatility and freedom. The vast majority of users won't need this, but as a game streamer that uses a laptop and an Xbox with a capture card, I've found it incredibly welcome to not need to Bluetooth to my TV to get game audio (but you can still do that if you want?!). The headset is heavily configurable, too. The Steelseries GG software on PC and mobile devices allows you to load up from a huge array of presets for various games, more so than any other headset I've tried. Even obscure games are represented here, which is impressive. The only downside is that you can't really delete any of the presets, nor favorite the ones you prefer. It can be a pain going back and forward between a gaming preset and a music preset, for example — but it's easily fixable. The software on PC in general could use a variety of improvements, as it sometimes hangs and features app downloads and things most people are doubtlessly unlikely to use (why would I need to download Discord from SteelSeries?). But, this is quite honestly my only gripe with the feature set, and thankfully, software is a comparably easy fix over a hardware flaw. This headset has no hardware flaws. The first iteration of the Arctis Nova Pro had a protrusion in the left ear that could get uncomfortable across long sessions, for example, but there's no such issue here. Maximum comfort, with maximum longevity, and superb, immaculate audio. For gaming, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite continues to excel. Games like Battlefield 6 and Overwatch absolutely sing on this device, giving away enemy positions with powerful tactical awareness, all without detracting from the more immersive sound design of the various virtual warzones we inhabit. The amount of tweaking you can do is impressive, too. Pushed to its extremes, the bass can get obnoxiously punchy if you want it to, or leave it thick and creamy, all while retaining maximum clarity and separation. Instruments sound like real instruments on this headset, which might sound like an odd thing to say — but you really feel the physicality of a kick drum or the slide of a bass string in this soundscape. Imagine how that translates to games with high-quality audio design, with explosions and gunfire zipping all around you. It's difficult to compare this to other gaming headsets as a result. The Arctis Nova Elite is just sublime. I wish the apps were a little less bloated and more focused, but it doesn't impact the sound experience. The microphone experience is good, too. As you can hear in the clip above, you're looking at crystal clear comms with the microphone extended, and very good call quality when it's retracted. You can set per-config sidetone too. The sidetone quality isn't the best, but it's more than adequate for game comms. All up, it's hard to find things to gripe about here. I wish the apps were a little less bloated and more focused, but it doesn't impact the sound experience. The number of settings you can alter and control is intuitive to set up and access, even if the software itself can be a bit slow at times. And hey, it can (and will) be updated. This headset is an absolute winner, but ... it's hard to look past that price point. There's pretty much no other headset that competes with the Arctis Nova Elite. On pure audio alone, the Arctis Nova Elite stands out in its own class and is more closely comparable to other hi-res headsets that typically don't fall into the gaming category. The only other headset with this kind of wireless versatility is the Astro A50 (2025), and the Arctis Nova Elite has it utterly beaten on raw audio, comfort, and lifestyle versatility. The Astro A50 is a pure gaming headset, though, and shaves $300 off the asking price to boot. I think, unless you were planning to use this headset everywhere and anywhere as a lifestyle option, you might get more bang for your buck with the similarly versatile Astro A50 ... but you wouldn't get the sound quality, multi-USB source mixing, or hot-swappable batteries. There's simply no real comparison here. The Arctis Nova Elite is well and truly in a category of its own. The Arctis Nova Elite is the ultimate gaming headset. It's the ultimate everything headset, frankly, able to easily accommodate high-end gaming, multi-device mixing for content creation, and day-to-day lifestyle use with ANC and Bluetooth. Its hi-res certification isn't just a sticker; it's immediately recognizable the second you commit a current to this headset. The sound reproduction puts the Arctis Nova Elite thoroughly in a category of its own, with few, if any, comparable peers. But boy howdy, it ain't cheap. You're going to either need to be a true all-day audio enthusiast, particularly fiscally affluent, or (like me) a poor financial planner to justify buying this. In my headset reviews, I tend to put a big emphasis on value for "most" people. Most of us are unlikely to look at a $599.99 headset and ever consider it an option — myself included. But with this, hearing is believing. It's one of the best headsets around. I've used my Arctis Nova Pro as my "daily" headset for several years at this point, and aside from some cushion wear, it's as good as it was the day I got it (and the cushions are easily replaced, too). If you were planning to use this headset for years and years, I think even the more budget-conscious could consider this headset, particularly if you wanted something you could use everywhere and anywhere. At the same time, would you feel comfy taking a $599.99 headset on the subway in that situation? I'm not sure I would. This headset is targeting a very specific type of customer unashamedly, and given what it offers, it's hard to penalize it for its price tag alone. The price makes sense given what's on offer. Whether or not it makes sense for your budget entirely depends on you and your needs. One thing I do know is you absolutely will not be disappointed. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite is a best-in-class headset boasting supreme versatility, comfort, audio, and specs. It also boasts a supreme price tag, shrugging off affordability for maximum features and luxury. You're either going to really want all of its features or have cash to burn to justify this headset, but either way, you won't be disappointed.

Title: Data-center operator CoreWeave is a stock-market darling. Bears see its finances as emblematic of an AI infrastructure bubble

Time Published: 2025-11-08T13:00:00Z
Full Content:
Jeremy Kahn is the AI editor at Fortune, spearheading the publication's coverage of artificial intelligence. He also co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. Leo Schwartz is a senior writer at Fortune covering fintech, crypto, venture capital, and financial regulation. A vast data center in Plano, Texas, is a symbol of the enormous AI infrastructure boom that has boosted stock markets and driven U.S. economic growth over the past year. The data center occupies more than 450,000 square feet and cost $1.6 billion to construct and equip. It supplies 30 megawatts of computing power to train and run AI models. Yet the company that runs it is a leading candidate to be ground-zero for a future AI financial meltdown. The data center is one of dozens around the world operated by CoreWeave, a company that develops and manages data centers and sells their computing capacity to technology companies. Its business is at the center of the AI economy—providing computing power to meet the voracious demand of the likes of Microsoft and OpenAI. But CoreWeave doesn’t own the Plano facility, nor does it own most of the data hubs it’s operating. And that is a part of the problem. The company is built, by its own admission, on a mountain of debt—obligations it has piled up as it races to build out a network of server farms for its customers. And that mountain looms far larger than the piles of cash that CoreWeave has brought in the door so far. When the company announces earnings on Monday, bulls and bears alike will be watching to see how its revenue is growing, and whether it has been able to pare its losses. CoreWeave’s earnings are likely to be a bellwether for the state of the entire AI boom, and for the industry’s massive and expensive infrastructure buildout in particular. CoreWeave has $7.6 billion in current liabilities—bills that fall due within 12 months—on its balance sheet, and $11 billion in debt overall, according to its most recent quarterly earnings report, filed in August. Coming from a tech giant like Google or Microsoft with tens of billions in free cash flow, such numbers wouldn’t raise an eyebrow. But CoreWeave’s revenues were only $1.9 billion in 2024. On its Q2 earnings call, CEO Michael Intrator told analysts that full year 2025 revenue would land between $5.15 billion to $5.35 billion. On the same call, the CEO said he expected CoreWeave’s capex for the year would total between $20 billion and $23 billion. Those short-term figures pale beside a bigger and potentially more onerous obligation that isn’t on its balance sheet: the $34 billion in scheduled lease payments that will start kicking in between now and 2028. Many of those payments are stretched over relatively long terms, of 10 years or more. Still, some of this is for data centers and office buildings that have not yet begun to operate or bring in revenue—representing a vulnerability if any of the as-yet-unprofitable startups CoreWeave sells computing services to are unable to meet their contractual obligations, or if construction delays mean CoreWeave is not able to provide capacity on time, allowing customers to cancel contracts. In a sense, Coreweave is a metaphor for the broader AI industry at the present moment, as top companies commit to enormous capex spending today in the confidence that it’ll be justified by future revenue from AI platforms and services. Investors appear to be broadly convinced by the company’s narrative: CoreWeave’s stock price is up 160% since the company’s IPO in March. But Fortune’s analysis of CoreWeave’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are laced with warnings and caveats, show how risky the company’s business model could be. In interviews with several analysts, bulls and bears agreed that CoreWeave’s fundamentals, as reflected in its filings, don’t currently add up. “A lot has to go right,” says Thomas Blakely, a managing director of software equity research at Cantor Fitzgerald, who rates CoreWeave “overweight.” (Of 26 equity analysts who currently cover the stock, 14 had the equivalent of buy or outperform ratings on the shares, while nine had “hold” ratings, and three had “underperform” or “sell” recommendations, according to data from S&P Market Intelligence.) The bears see CoreWeave as a strong candidate to find itself underwater with its mounting liabilities, making it potentially the first domino to fall in the AI ecosystem. “To say they’ll scale out of this is questionable,” says Gil Luria, the head of technology research at the investment firm D.A. Davidson. “I don’t see how it becomes more profitable.” He believes that the likeliest outcome for CoreWeave on a five-year time horizon is bankruptcy—either because its current customers will be able to rely on their own infrastructure by then, or because an increasingly stretched CoreWeave will no longer be able to borrow. In a statement to Fortune, a company spokesperson said that “CoreWeave’s capital structure and financial performance are strong and underpinned by long-term take-or-pay contracts signed with the world’s leading enterprises and AI labs who partner with CoreWeave because we deliver the best AI cloud.” The statement went on to say that the company structured its contracts to “support and repay any related debt obligations while generating additional free cash flow. CoreWeave operates in a supply-constrained market where demand far exceeds capacity, and our hyper-growth is evidence of the trust leading companies place in us to power their most critical AI workloads.” With the company continuing to make huge new spending commitments even as it books new future revenue, AI investors’ attention will be glued to its upcoming quarterly earnings report. One number that everyone will be watching is CoreWeave’s “remaining performance obligations,” or RPOs—essentially revenues that CoreWeave has booked but that have not yet been paid. (Like its scheduled lease payments, CoreWeave’s RPOs are excluded from its balance sheet.) If CoreWeave is booking the kinds of contracts that will pull it out of debt sooner rather than later, the RPOs level—and the forecast for how quickly those future bookings are likely to turn into actual cash—are where they would show up. The company has announced several major new deals since its last quarterly earnings announcement, including a $14.2 billion agreement to supply Meta with computing capacity, and an pact with AI startup Poolside for a data center stuffed with 40,000 Nvidia GPUs. So it is likely its RPO total will climb significantly. Wall Street analysts’ forecasts for the company’s 2026 revenue range from $10.9 billion to $14.9 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.Bulls argue that this is exactly how the boom will play out in CoreWeave’s favor: The revenue will come through, in great quantity, and its scale will solve the company’s problems by catching up with and then outpacing its capital expenditures. In that scenario, the company becomes the next Levi Strauss or Amazon Web Services, providing the “picks and shovels” of the AI boom, and getting filthy rich. “The potential is beyond the scope of our imagination at this point,” says Kevin Dede, a senior technology analyst at the financial services firm H.C. Wainwright, which rates CoreWeave a “buy.” But for now CoreWeave is miles away from being profitable and is bleeding cash, absent its ability to issue debt. The RPOs it reported in its most recent earnings that are likely to be realized in the next 12 months are not, on their own, sufficient to cover its current obligations and announced growth plans (more on that shortly). The company has razor-thin operating margins—1.6% in the past quarter. After accounting for its large interest expenses, those margins turn sharply negative. The company lost more than $600 million on $2.2 billion in revenue in the first six months of 2025. “That’s not great,” Luria says. “Is there any way that gap closes?”Barring an enormous surge in revenue over the next 12 months or so, the company will likely need to borrow more money, or renegotiate with creditors, in order to cover the obligations already on its books. To be sure, the AI boom could deliver that revenue surge—but even slight weakening in spending growth across the industry could hit CoreWeave disproportionately. Kerrisdale Capital, an investment management firm that is shorting the stock, is pithy in its conclusions: CoreWeave, it wrote in a September report, is “the poster child of the AI infrastructure bubble.” CoreWeave began as a crypto-mining company, a side project of a few friends who were hedge-fund traders. Crypto mining, like AI, relies heavily on graphic processing units, or GPUs, with the chips racing to solve complicated algorithms that spit out currency rewards for correctly verifying blockchain transactions, and CoreWeave was a steady buyer. Over time, Brian Venturo, one of the company’s founders, realized that the rise in AI would be a major factor fueling the surge in demand for the computing power of the GPUs that CoreWeave was already accumulating. Beginning in October 2021, CoreWeave entered into two deals with asset management firm Magnetar Capital, raising first $50 million in convertible notes, and then a year later, an additional $125 million, also in convertible notes. The company used nearly all of it to buy GPUs from Nvidia. Over the next few years, CoreWeave would secure billions of dollars in a combination of debt and equity, building out a sprawling array of data centers across the U.S., and eventually expanding to the U.K. This March, CoreWeave’s IPO made it one of the closest things to a pure-play AI company to debut on public markets. Initially, fears about the company’s debt load restrained its stock’s performance. But its shares took off in May after it reported its first quarterly earnings, including soaring revenue growth of 420% quarter-on-quarter. While the price has declined since a peak in June, CoreWeave shares closed on Friday at $104, up from a debut of $40. But as Luria puts it, the bear case for CoreWeave is simple math. The company’s business model is to borrow capital and then use that capital to build data centers filled with GPUs and then sell time on those GPUs to AI companies. “The question is, are they getting a sufficient return … on their investment to justify the interest they’re paying on their debt?” Luria says. Its most recent filings show how hefty that debt has become. The problem isn’t just the amount of CoreWeave’s debt. It’s the structure—most of it is more expensive than average for corporate debt, and much of it comes due in the next nine months. Of CoreWeave’s current liabilities, $3.6 billion is debt payable by June 30, 2026, just part of $11 billion in overall debt the company carries on its balance sheet. Much of that debt carries hefty interest rates of between 9% and 15%, according to the financial statements, with 11% being the weighted average rate overall. (This fall, rates on newly issued investment-grade corporate debt have hovered between 5.5% and 6%, according to Moody’s. The rate at which CoreWeave is able to borrow has come down over time, with most of its newer debt issued at closer to 9%. ) The majority of CoreWeave’s outstanding debt, its statements show, is in the form of two loans, called Delayed Draw Term Loan (DDTL)1.0 and DDTL 2.0. There is $1.8 billion outstanding on the DDTL 1.0, at a 15% interest rate, and $5 billion in DDTL 2.0, at an 11% interest rate. The company has begun payment on DDTL 1.0; quarterly principal payments on DDTL 2.0 are due beginning in January 2026. (The interest rates on both these loans are floating.) This is where the company’s RPOs come in. CoreWeave says that as of June 30 it had a little over $30 billion, the majority of which should turn into actual sales over the next four years. The company says 50% of that amount, or $15 billion, will be recognized in the next two years. Assuming half of that will in turn be recognized in the next year, that means the company should have $7.5 billion coming in. But if its operating margins remain at just 1.6%, the company will only generate $120 million in income from this $7.5 billion—not enough to cover its interest expenses or make the principal repayments on its debt. That implies that CoreWeave’s returns remain far below the cost of its capital. Higher RPOs, of course, would mean more revenue for CoreWeave next year. That said, there are also far more capital expenses to come. CoreWeave continues to spend heavily to purchase Nvidia GPUs—which make up the great majority of its capital expenditures—and other equipment to outfit its data centers. In the first half of 2025, for example, it invested $4.7 billion in property, plant and equipment while bringing in only $2.2 billion in revenue. The report from Kerrisdale cites similar concerns as Luria in justifying its short position. CoreWeave is “a debt-fueled GPU rental business with no moat, dressed up as innovation,” the firm writes, arguing that the stock faces a 90% downside. Luria and Kerrisdale both cite CoreWeave’s highly concentrated customer base as another potential peril—a reality that CoreWeave itself acknowledged in its last earnings report. “A substantial portion of our revenue is driven by a limited number of our customers, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in, spend from one or a few of our top customers would adversely affect our business,” the company wrote. Most notably: In the second quarter of 2025, an eye-popping 71% of CoreWeave’s revenue came from Microsoft alone. To be sure, Microsoft has a better credit rating than many countries, including the United States, and is unlikely to renege on its contract with CoreWeave. And CoreWeave’s contracts with its lessees generally require them to pay to the ends of their leases even if they don’t wind up utilizing them, except in case of “nonperformance.” Much of CoreWeave’s utility has come from offering readily available compute as those companies raced to scale up their own operations. But with Microsoft set to spend tens of billions of dollars on developing its own data centers, it may not need CoreWeave’s services in the future. “They will pay their obligations, but the likelihood of them renewing at the end of the contract is much less guaranteed,” Luria says. CoreWeave’s other major customer, OpenAI, is another matter. In March, CoreWeave entered an agreement with Sam Altman’s AI giant, with OpenAI committed to paying $11.9 billion through October 2030, with a $4 billion expansion announced in May. But OpenAI itself has made commitments far beyond its current cash flow—including commitments in the many hundreds of billions to Oracle, Nvidia and other data center providers. If OpenAI runs into any financial troubles, Luria says, CoreWeave likely wouldn’t be first to receive payments, compared to much larger OpenAI partners like Microsoft, Amazon, or even Oracle. (That’s also the case for some of the other, smaller venture-backed and loss-making AI startups CoreWeave serves, such as poolside, Cohere, and Mistral.) To rely on CoreWeave’s ties to OpenAI, he says, “You have to believe that OpenAI is going to be unbelievably successful, so much so that it can pay everybody that’s ahead in line.” All of this means there’ll be plenty at stake when CoreWeave reports earnings on Monday. The company will also be digesting a recent setback: In late October, the shareholders of Core Scientific, a crypto miner with a hoard of computing resources that CoreWeave coveted, rejected CoreWeave’s $9 billion all-stock acquisition offer. (CoreWeave will console itself with a $270 million breakup fee—an amount that will help it cover the $360 million it is expected to pay Core Scientific to lease data center capacity from it next year. Overall, CoreWeave is on the hook to pay Core Scientific some $10 billion in future lease payments over the next 12 years, which may have been one reason CoreWeave was eager to try to use its highly-valued shares to purchase Core Scientific in an all-equity deal valued at $9 billion when the offer was initially made.) The argument for CoreWeave’s success is just as simple as the math against it: AI is going to represent a transformational shift in the global economy, and CoreWeave is powering the technology’s growth. As the development of AI accelerates, so will the demand for computing power from companies aside from the hyperscalers, all hungry for the services of providers like CoreWeave. What’s more, today’s creditors may be willing to wait a little longer for that demand to materialize: The lenders behind DDTL 2.0 recently renegotiated the terms of the loan to delay the start of principal payments. Blakely, at Cantor Fitzgerald, says that CoreWeave is already diversifying its customer base, noting the recent deal with Meta. “It’s a growth business,” he says, in reference to CoreWeave’s capital expenditures. “If business is growing, you have to invest against it.” He and other bulls see a future where the company is no longer laden with debt. Once CoreWeave sheds its liabilities over the next five years, Blakely says, a growing percent of its revenue can begin coming from infrastructure that’s already paid off, boosting CoreWeave’s margins. Moreover, Blakely says that new models of chips might run more efficiently or be able to fetch a higher premium from customers, allowing CoreWeave to hold more pricing power. Blakely says that those $30.1 billion in RPOs—the revenue that has been booked but not yet delivered—are likely to increase meaningfully in CoreWeave’s next earnings, based on recently announced agreements. But the number to watch might be the additional obligations in borrowing that the company will take on to service them: If those obligations scale up alongside the booked revenue, bears say, CoreWeave still risks running out of cash unless it takes on yet more debt, raises more equity, or gets existing creditors to extend terms. Blakely acknowledges that a sustainable path forward for CoreWeave is perilous. “A lot has to go right,” he says. Still, he compares the current moment in AI to the beginning of the smartphone era, where analysts doubted Apple’s claims that it would transform global communication. “CoreWeave is a leader there in terms of this market,” Blakely says. “If they can maintain that lead … they will be able to participate in the spoils.” CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story stated incorrectly that Coreweave’s quarterly principal payments for DDTL 1.0 would begin in January 2026; those payments have already begun.

Title: It’s not a bubble, because AI is already running the markets

AI isn’t a bubble. It’s already reshaping markets. Autonomous AI agents now drive trading, outperforming humans and rewriting how money moves. Opinion by: Saad Naja, Founder and CEO at PiP World While the world debates whether AI is the next dot-com bubble, chasing valuations rather than implications, they’re missing the underlying innovation story. The same AI infrastructure fueling trillion-dollar bets is already rewriting how money moves. AI is no longer an investment theme. It’s the market itself. What few noticed is that the same AI infrastructure driving the headlines is already reshaping the markets from within. The invisible battle happening behind the candlesticks isn’t bulls and bears anymore; it’s between self-learning AIs that never sleep. Markets aren’t just humans using algorithms. They’re autonomous swarms fighting for milliseconds. Agents watch every market 24/7, spotting risks, debating strategies and executing without hesitation. Recent breakthroughs in AI and blockchain acceptance have created the perfect conditions for agentic markets to flourish. AI provides cognition; meanwhile, blockchain supplies trust, verification and payment rails. This offers the medium for AI agents to transact, prove, and exchange value freely. AI has crossed the chasm from stock picker to near-autonomous day trader. It learns and acts faster than any human. It spots what humans miss, predicts the move before it happens and never second-guesses itself. It’s the ultimate insider, without inflaming the SEC. It’s early days for agentic AI in trading, but make no mistake — it’s here and already moving the markets while most traders sleep. During the biggest crypto flash crash on Oct. 10, while the rest of the crypto market was in freefall, AI agents did the opposite. They stayed calm, shorted the chaos, and ended the week up 40%. They gave us a glimpse into the future of markets. One where the AI agents don’t just follow code, they respond like real traders. Some cut risk instantly. Others waited for confirmation. A few leaned into the drawdown. What’s striking is not just the gains, it’s the composure. Each AI agent made its own independent decisions, yet collectively, they converged on profitable outcomes. That’s the essence of agentic intelligence, autonomous systems learning to interpret chaos as opportunity. Companies describe similar behavior within trading desks, where agentic systems parse live data from public disclosures and feed execution layers in real-time. Over time, agents evolve from code to cognition. Autonomous systems that read markets, understand intent and execute strategies on their own. Acting like a digital hive mind, adjusting logic mid-session as markets shift around them. For years, quant funds and high-frequency traders have pitted humans plus algorithms against the market. Enter AI versus AI. Self-directed systems plan, reason and execute around the clock. What’s emerging is a battlefield of AIs — institutional, retail, and synthetic — talking to each other in real-time. When AI trades with AI, human intent disappears. Prices move on machine-to-machine negotiations, not emotion or fundamentals. The market begins to trade itself. Related: AI gives retail investors a way out of the diversification trap A majority of global trading volume now runs through algorithmic systems, estimates ranging from 60% to 89%, depending on the market. Within months, Symphony’s agentic trading layer was clearing $140 million in transactions, working with 15 of the world’s biggest financial institutions to test self-learning yield and execution agents. For decades, investing was about finding an edge. AI gives retail investors that power for the first time. Retail traders can soon deploy the same logic once reserved for billion-dollar funds. Swarm intelligence that scans arbitrage, simulates momentum, hedges risk and executes collaboratively. It’s the retail equivalent of a hedge fund in your pocket. The walls between institutional and retail finance are eroding. AI makes the 1%’s playbook accessible to the 99%. The next outperformers will deploy agentic swarms, rather than tracking indexes. AI versus AI warfare will define liquidity, volatility and price discovery. Humans will still set direction, risk tolerance and capital allocation, but won’t press the buttons. Markets will begin to self-trade in swarms of autonomous participants. Power will shift to whomever fine-tunes the feedback loops. When agents detect each other’s footprints, they’ll evolve meta-strategies, sometimes to cooperate, sometimes to manipulate one another. Trading floors are going quiet. The next generation of traders won’t shout orders; they’ll train AI agents. The winners won’t just be institutions, they’ll be retail traders who fine-tune their swarms alongside human judgment. We’re entering the agentic arms race. Markets of tomorrow won’t sleep or panic. Agentic AI will learn, evolve, compete and occasionally conspire at breakneck speed. While institutions continue to build layers of agents, retail investors face a choice. Follow the herd into AI stocks, or start training their own AI as their wing(wo)man. They won’t have an AlphaGo moment. Quiet, relentless outperformance hides in the charts, open to anyone brave enough to seize their AI agent. Opinion by: Saad Naja, Founder and CEO at PiP World.

Title: Bubble Trouble: Is too much being spent on AI?
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/1108/1542794-ai-bubble-tech/
Time Published: 2025-11-08T07:00:00Z

Adam Maguire Business Journalist Michael Burry - the man who famously spotted the US subprime mortgage crisis years before most others - thinks there's an AI bubble. This week it was revealed that he had taken a $1.1 billion bet against chip-maker Nvidia and Peter Thiel’s Palantir – where he will profit if their stock prices fall. But it’s not just professional market sceptics like Burry that think things may be overheated in tech. Jamie Dimon, the head of JP Morgan, recently warned that US stocks – in particular tech stocks - are over-heated. Morgan Stanley chief executive Ted Pick and Goldman Sachs head David Soloman have also warned of an impending correction. Even big tech cheerleaders like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos have said there is an AI bubble. Meanwhile Sam Altman, the head of AI revolution icon OpenAI, thinks valuations and spending has gotten carried away. Why do they think this is a bubble? You can get some clue of why if you look at the quarterly results some of the world’s big tech companies published last week. Microsoft, for example, said it spent nearly $35 billion on capital expenditure in the quarter. Capital expenditure wouldn’t necessarily all be AI-related but in this case the vast bulk of it is. To put that figure into context, Ireland’s Budget 2026 was worth around €9.4 billion - or roughly $10.8 billion. So Microsoft spent more than three times Ireland’s annual budget in a single quarter. Meanwhile Facebook owner Meta said it would spend as much as $72 billion on capital expenditure this year. Google owner Alphabet said it would spend up to $93 billion. Amazon said its full year capital budget would be $125 billion this year – and even higher next year. And that’s just four of the big tech companies - it wouldn’t include AI spending by other large firms like Apple, Tesla, X, Oracle or Palantir. Nor would it include the tens hundreds of millions - or even billions - being spent by other big-but-not-massive companies. Or the money being invested by venture capitalists and private equity. And most of that money is ultimately going towards building data centres and buying high end computer chips - but it’s also being spent at employee level too. Back in June Sam Altman claimed that Meta was offering his top engineers pay packets valued at $300m if they moved over to Team Zuckerberg. That included a $100m signing-on bonus. The likes of Meta have also spent billions to buy stakes in, or acquire outright, AI startups that have promising-looking ideas. The scale of all of this is so significant that Goldman Sachs estimated that AI investment was a bigger contributor to growth in the US economy in the first half of the year than consumer spending. In fact, if you took out the money being spent on AI, the US economy was stagnant in the first half of the year. And tech companies’ valuations have risen to match – largely based on the promise and expectation that all this spending now will result in them making even more money in the not-too-distant future. Are there any signs of that happening? No - An MIT study in August found that, when you strip away all the hype, 95% of firms were getting zero return on their AI investments. It’s not entirely true to say that no-one is making money from AI… some are. Or, more specifically, one company is. So far the only clear winner from the AI race is Nvidia, which designs the computer chips that are powering all of these data centres that big tech firms are rushing to build. It’s gone from being a relatively niche player in the market to being the most valuable listed company in the world. As recently as its 2020 results, Nvidia had profits of $2.8 billion – which isn’t bad by any measure. But now, in the single quarter between May and July, it had a profit of $26.4 billion. It is now comfortably on track to make more than $100 billion in profit this year – which would be about 36 times the profit it made just a few years ago. For most others, though, it’s a different story. Despite their huge investments to date the likes of Meta, Alphabet and Microsoft have yet to really show the benefit AI has brought to their bottom line. Some are pointing to it being a cost-saving measure – Amazon’s recent jobs cuts, for example, were framed as them leaning on AI to be able to reduce bureaucracy. But if that’s the rationale it will take many more cuts to justify the hundreds of billions of investment. And it’s not just the big tech companies that are struggling to make it viable – the dedicated AI creators are not seeing a return yet either. Anthropic made a $5.3 billion loss last year. Elon Musk’s xAI is predicted to record a $13 billion loss this year. Even the poster-child of AI – OpenAI – made a $5 billion loss last year. That means that every time you ask ChatGPT to compose an email for you, or ask it to devise the best scrambled eggs recipe, it’s costing them money. Despite that, there are suggestions it could be valued at $1 trillion when it floats on the New York Stock Exchange in the not-too-distant future. So if it’s not making money, what’s the justification for that valuation? OpenAI and its backers hope it is following the same kind of playbook we’ve seen from so many tech start-ups over the years. This is where it has a great idea, great technology and great people – and once it builds a big enough customer base and gains efficiencies of scale, the profits will start to flow. And, in fairness, its revenue looks to have more than doubled year on year – and it recently started to unveil a range of products and services it plans to provide – including a web-browser, which will open the door to it service ads too. In the meantime, though, they’ve also committed to invest around $1.4 trillion in other companies over the next few years – which will include buying computer chips and data centre capacity to help handle the queries from all of those extra customers. But within those deals it’s making is also an interesting dynamic that has added to concerns about an AI bubble – and that’s how a lot of the investment that’s taking place seem to be almost circular. For example, one big part of OpenAI’s recent investments was a $300 billion deal with Oracle to tap into its data centre capacity. In turn, Oracle has committed to spend tens of billions of dollars to buy Nvidia chips to power its data centres. Meanwhile, Nvidia has invested $100 billion of its money into OpenAI. Which essentially means that the three companies are passing billions of dollars around in a circle. So if this is a bubble, what happens when it bursts? Well the first thing there is the 'when’ of the when. Just because there’s a growing consensus that there is a bubble, doesn’t mean that it’s ready to pop. Going back to Michael Burry – he made his first bet against the subprime mortgage market in mid-2005; it took pretty much two years for that bet to pay off. And as readers (or viewers) of The Big Short may remember, he received a lot of flak during those two years from investors who thought he was costing them a fortune. It should also be said that, while he was right that time, he can be wrong too. He took bets out against big tech stocks in 2023 too, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has risen by nearly 80% since then. But assuming it is a matter of ‘when’ and not ‘if’, there are a whole range of predictions around what a burst AI bubble might mean. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has kind of downplayed his company’s exposure - saying that spending all of this money on data centres now was essentially just front-loading what they’ll need in the years ahead. So, he argues, worst case scenario it’ll just mean they’ll be futureproofed against a natural growth of demand for its services in the years ahead. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos suggested that while this is a bubble, it wouldn’t be a ‘bad’ bubble like the financial crisis. Instead he said it would be a ‘good’ bubble, comparing it to the Dot Com crash. His argument is that while a lot of companies collapsed in the Dot Com crash, a handful that had good ideas and viable models – including Amazon and Google – survived and thrived. He thinks the same will happen here – the tide will go out and expose those that can’t back up all of their big talk, but the useful platforms will stick it out and usher in big changes for the world. Of course that comparison does skirt over the negative impact this kind of ‘good’ bubble can have. All of those bankruptcies and valuation write-downs means lost investments and a shock to the stock market, which perhaps impacts people’s pensions, and likely leads to job cuts too. So it wouldn’t just be a case of adjusting a balance sheet or two and moving on. But is there the potential for contagion? Again, it depends first and foremost on how much more bubbly the bubble gets before it bursts. But no more than AI investment is feeding growth in the wider US and world economy right now, a dramatic collapse in investment and valuations in the sector will have a knock-on effect on national and global GDP too. There’s also the very practical impact of jobs cuts – direct and indirect. If it turns out that the AI industry has gotten too big and expensive, some of those being hired now will likely be let go. Meanwhile companies that see the value of their AI investments getting written down may need to make cuts elsewhere to cover their losses. It could also have a knock-on impact on areas like construction and consumer spending. And one concern around a potential AI crash relates to that circularity of investment that’s being seen at the moment. A big part of the boom in Nvidia’s revenue is based on the scramble to make use of OpenAI’s tools. Oracle’s stock price also reflects the fact that it’s been promised $300 billion of business from OpenAI in the coming years. As a major shareholder in OpenAI, Microsoft’s valuation is also boosted by the belief that Sam Altman’s firm will become massively profitable in the near future. Meanwhile Amazon has done its own multi-billion dollar deal with OpenAI to provide it with data centre capacity to power its AI platforms. That means that all of those big tech companies have a lot to gain from OpenAI’s success – and a lot to lose if it turns out that the technology isn’t nearly as useful as many hope. Its importance to these major firms has led to suggestions by some that the company is already too big to fail. Some have even started to call for it to be broken up to reduce the systemic risk it poses. That’s despite the fact that it’s currently still privately held, and still losing billions of dollars a year. Business Journalist Follow@AdamMaguire © RTÉ 2025.

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/07/2025 9:24:26 AM PST by DFG The man who predicted the 2008 financial crash could soon be proven right again. On Tuesday, Michael Burry — who became a household name after predicting the 2008 crash and inspiring the film The Big Short — had wagered more than $1 billion that Wall Street's AI boom will end in tears. Now the cracks are showing. US tech stocks are on track for their worst week since Donald Trump's 'liberation day' tariffs rattled global markets in April. Eight of the most valuable AI-driven companies — among them Nvidia, Meta, Palantir and Oracle — have lost a staggering $1.1 trillion in market value since the end of last week. By midday in New York, The S&P 500 was down 1.2 percent, the Nasdaq 2 percent and the Dow 300 points, or 0.7 percent. The Nasdaq is on course for a 4 percent weekly loss, its sharpest decline since Trump's tariff war years. Burry specifically bet that the value of stock for Nvidia and Palantir — two of the market’s hottest AI plays — would fall, and those two have been hardest hit. Shares of Nvidia — the world's most valuable company — tumbled another 4 percent Friday, leaving them down 13 percent for the week. Palantir has plunged 17 percent since Monday, Filings show Burry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, disclosed put options worth about $900 million against Palantir and $187 million against Nvidia. A put option is a financial bet that pays off if a company's share price falls. CEO Jensen Huang made things worse by admitting that 'China is going to win the AI race.' He later tried to walk back the remark, but investors were already spooked. (Excerpt) Read more at dailymail.co.uk ...

Love Business Insider? Log into Google and make us a preferred source. Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up now Market musings Earnings season has been good. Perhaps… too good. The run-ups in the stock market's favorite tech darlings after earnings last week apparently pushed valuations to a point where investors decided they'd had enough. It's led to a chaotic current week, with two separate valuation-driven sell-offs in a matter of three days. The institutional class is as split as ever over what the future holds. JPMorgan is recommending investors buy any dips. Billionaire Ray Dalio sees a short-term rally, and then a Fed-driven sell-off. And then there's the overhang of what will happen with President Trump's tariffs, which are facing a prolonged legal battle. But that only tells part of the story. As retail investing has exploded in popularity, so has the influence of the day-traders populating Reddit and Discord forums. Their behavior can often be a harbinger of what's to come, and the strategy team JPMorgan has conveniently been keeping tabs. Here are the four main themes that have dominated retail trading over the past week as volatility has raged. They went on their biggest buying spree in four months, almost entirely in mega-cap tech But they're not blindly buying market dips They're getting tired of gold and bitcoin after torrid rallies They're most excited about these meme stocks Judging by a "social interest score" tracked by JPMorgan, the "most hyped" stocks this past week were: Beyond Meat, Nokia, POET Technologies, UiPath, Palantir, Nvidia, Chipotle, and Reddit. Are you a retail investor that's leaning into these trends, or doing something completely different? Let us know what portfolio moves you've been making at firsttrade@businessinsider.com. On the heels of another difficult day in the market, console yourself with another example of the value-creating impact of AI deals. Snap stock surged as much as 18% after announcing a $400 million partnership with Perplexity AI, to incorporate its AI search engine into Snapchat. It's a good reminder that — even on the toughest of days — AI deals trump all, and can carry a stock to market-beating performance. Is the gig up for gold? At least as an S&P 500-crushing speculative asset? It appears so. Following a 20% run up through September and into October, the price of the precious metal has come back down to earth. The chart above, from JPMorgan, reflects a corresponding shift in sentiment, specifically among retail investors. Note the blue line, which shows that retail buying has plateaued. Each Friday, I'll discuss and review a piece of markets- or finance-related media: movies, books, TV shows, podcasts, etc. Today's entry is the movie "Boiler Room" (2000). There are some quotes at the beginning of "Boiler Room" — namely "I just want to get in" and "nobody wants to work for it anymore" — that echo the frivolous, fundamental-lite stock market activity that characterized the meme stock era. Right away, you know this is a movie that's going to deal with a popular evergreen theme: how to get rich quick. This film is best approached by suspending belief around the illegalities occurring. The schemes are sub-Wolf-of-Wall-Street penny-stock pump and dumps, where the companies don't even exist. It would never happen, at least this flagrantly, but that's not the point. It's all merely a vessel for the movie's top-notch cast of wisecracking early-2000s actors masquerading as stock-brokers. Vin Diesel executes a pitch-perfect sales call in front of 100 associates, closing the deal to rapt applause. Ben Affleck — the firm's head recruiter — delivers two scintillating motivational monologues to a room full of new hires. Key quote: "Anybody who tells you that money is the root of all evil, doesn't f**king have any." Leading man Giovanni Ribisi excels as a whip-smart, money-hungry youngster who's looking to make the leap from backroom poker games to stock-broking millionaire. And it feels like Jamie Kennedy is acting in a different movie — perhaps channeling his "Malibu's Most Wanted" character at some points — but it doesn't matter, he steals every scene he's in. At one point, the core group of brokers sit around trading extended recitations of the original "Wall Street." There's an analogy in there somewhere. Of course, the movie doesn't take place exclusively within the walls of the Long Island-based JT Marlin (yes, it's that obvious of a play on JPMorgan). The crew ventures into NYC a handful of times to beat up rival brokers from the "real" Wall Street, and party at a hotel in celebration of a new (fraudulent) IPO launch. These are electric and hilarious scenes, and they show that the movie is at its strongest when the core cast is ripping it up, even if a lot of the dialogue is offensive enough to be left in the year 2000. It's not the best finance movie of all time. But, for my money, it's the most fun. And for that reason it gets a 10/10 rating. Do you have any ideas about what I should review next?

Title: The Vulnerability of Forests to Natural Disturbances

Full Content:
Ministèrede l'Agriculture,de l'Agro-Alimentaireet de la Souverainetéalimentaire 07 novembre 2025 Info + Partager la page Sommaire The Analysis Notes present, in four pages, the main points of discussion on a current topic relevant to the areas of activity of the Department of Agriculture, Agri-Food, and Food Sovereignty. Depending on the topic, they take a forward-looking, strategic, or evaluative approach. Analysis n°224 Forests are increasingly threatened by natural disturbances, which are being exacerbated by climate change. This note explores the growing risks that will emerge in the future. It details several vulnerability factors and the associated environmental and economic impacts. In an uncertain context, understanding the interplay between the various components of risk makes it possible to prioritise actions that can mitigate it. Proactive management of forest fuel or the recovery of storm-damaged timber, for instance, are measures that can help address this challenge. Forests are affected by so-called “natural” disturbances, whether biotic (e.g. pathogens) or abiotic (e.g. fires). Their occurrence may nevertheless be of anthropogenic origin, as is the case for the majority of fires in France. Climate change intensifies these disturbances and places an increasing threat on the functions of forests: timber production, carbon sequestration, biodiversity reservoir, etc. The recent multiplication of extreme events, such as the fires in France during the summer of 2022 or the wildfire events that devastated forests in the Aude department in August 2025, has heightened the visibility of these disturbances in public debate. Awareness has also grown of their role in the decline of the land carbon sink1. The concepts associated with the notion of “risk” are numerous, each carrying a specific meaning. This note clarifies the constituent elements of the risks generated by natural disturbances in forests and illustrates them with concrete cases concerning Europe (including France) and the United States. The first part defines the components of risk (hazard, asset, vulnerability) and presents trends of the future evolution of hazards for the main disturbance agents. The second part reviews some of the environmental and economic consequences of current and future disturbances. Finally, examples of practices to reduce vulnerability through forest management or organisational solutions are described. Risk is a polysemous term, defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as the potential for adverse consequences for a system to which certain values and objectives are attached2. It is a composite notion, resulting from the encounter of three components: a hazard, an element exposed to that hazard (or asset), and its vulnerability. The hazard corresponds to the physical phenomenon capable of causing harm. The notion covers both the characteristics of the event (e.g. wind speed, burnt area) and its probability of occurrence. Hazards that correspond to punctual events (e.g. fire, storm) cause catastrophic mortality, i.e. sudden and massive, in forest stands. Others have more diffuse impacts, such as droughts, which correspond to periods of thermal and/or rainfall anomalies compared to past references. The exposed element here is the forest ecosystem, which possesses use and non-use values for society and provides ecosystem services (e.g. timber production, landscape amenities). The asset corresponds to the proper ecosystem functioning of the forest. Independently of its degree of exposure, i.e. presence in a given area, a forest is characterised by a certain level of vulnerability, meaning a predisposition to being negatively impacted. It may be vulnerable due to its predisposition to damage (sensitivity) or its limited ability to adjust to and recover from damage (adaptive capacity). Figure 1 – Breakdown of the concept of risk Ce schéma montre que le risque émerge à l’intersection de trois notions : l’aléa, l’exposition et la vulnérabilité. This diagram visually represents that risk emerges at the intersection of three notions: hazard, exposure and vulnerability. Reading: risk emerges from the encounter of a hazard that affects an exposed element characterised by a certain level of vulnerability. Source : IPCC, 2022, Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability Vulnerability may be intrinsic, linked to the physiological traits of trees, the composition and structure of stands, etc.3. For instance, some species are more resistant to fires due to thicker bark, or better adapted to rapid recovery, by resprouting (e.g. oaks) or via seed banks (e.g. Aleppo pine). Conversely, a forest with a high presence of fuel (e.g. dense understorey) is more prone to high-intensity fires. Forest vulnerability may also be extrinsic, linked to forest management, spatial planning, or land use. For example, the presence of roads makes forests more accessible for prevention and firefighting, but also more exposed to fire outbreaks caused by humans. Similarly, the existence of a monitoring system enables earlier detection of pathogen invasions. Climate change increases risk by worsening disturbance regimes (the hazard component), in other words by altering the frequency, intensity and seasonality of disturbance events and the areas they affect. These effects may be direct, for example when water stress due to lack of rainfall and longer, more intense periods of high temperatures weaken trees. They may also be indirect, particularly when new pathogens migrate and become viable (e.g. pine processionary caterpillar) or when endemic species enter epidemic phases (e.g. spruce bark beetle). Between the periods 1950–2000 and 2001–2019, damage caused by natural disturbances increased by 17% in Europe. Storms accounted for 46% of damage across both periods, followed by fires (24%), bark beetles (17%), other biotic agents (8%, e.g. diseases such as ash dieback and chestnut blight), and abiotic agents (8%, e.g. drought, snow). The increase in damage has been particularly marked in recent years for fires and bark beetles (Figure 2). The latter were responsible for 50% of the timber harvest in Germany in 2021. In France, in Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, 30,000 hectares of coniferous forests containing spruces (18% of the regional total) were destroyed or harvested between 2018 and 2022 due to bark beetle attacks. Since 2023, the crisis has affected all altitudinal levels of the Jura massif, including above 1,000 m4. Droughts, meanwhile, affected 0.5 million hectares of forests between 1987 and 2016 in Europe, and four of the five most severe events occurred after 20005. Figure 2 – Annual damage due to natural forest disturbances in Europe, 1950–2019 Ce graphique représente l’évolution des dommages en forêt causés par plusieurs catégories de perturbations naturelles, de 1950 à 2019. On voit que ceux-ci ont fortement augmenté au cours du temps. This graph shows the evolution of forest damage caused by several categories of natural disturbances, from 1950 to 2019. It illustrates the strong increase in damage over time. Source : Patacca M. et al. 2022, “Significant increase in natural disturbance impacts on European forests since 1950”, Global Change Biology Southern Europe could, during the 21st century, experience a 40 to 100% increase in annual burnt area. The fire season could lengthen by 20 days, and the probability of “megafires” increase tenfold6, 7. Temperate and boreal regions would also be affected, albeit to a lesser extent. In France, fire risk is expected to rise particularly sharply in the West and along the Mediterranean coastline8. For a +4 °C warming by the end of the century, the fire season would last 131 days and fires would affect 67% of the south-eastern quarter of the country, compared with 78 days and 28% at present9. Climate change accelerates the development cycle of pathogens and extends the areas favourable to them. The main epidemic currently underway is that of the spruce bark beetle. In western Europe, the damage it causes could be six times higher in 2021–2030 compared with 1971–201010. Storms are rare and complex events that are difficult to model. Climate change could increase wind speeds and make extreme events more common. In central Europe, a storm that is currently expected once a century could see its return period shortened to around 70 years by 210011. The different hazards interact with one another. For example, a forest damaged by a storm is more vulnerable to pathogens, and a drought increases the likelihood of fires. These interactions are expected to intensify under climate change, particularly with regard to biotic risks, making it necessary to adopt a “multi-hazard” perspective12. The occurrence of a hazard directly alters the structure and composition of the forest, as well as the ecosystem services it provides. In the short term, many trees may be destroyed or damaged, and biogeochemical cycles and habitats disrupted. The reorganisation phase that follows immediately after the hazard is crucial13, as it is when the communities that will make up the future forest establish themselves. Several outcomes are possible, ranging from full resilience (same composition and structure) to transition towards a non-forest state (in the case of major and/or repeated hazards), with intermediate states also possible. Biodiversity is affected through the impacts of disturbances on habitats. An affected area may see its species richness (number of species present) increase, decrease or remain stable14. This ambiguous relationship varies depending on the species and the dynamics of disturbances. Negative impacts often concern species that favour closed canopies (e.g. lichens), while others depend on disturbances to survive and establish themselves in open environments. The highest biodiversity levels, at landscape scale, are observed for disturbances of medium severity and size. Conversely, extreme events are generally harmful due to their tendency to homogenise habitats over large areas. The disappearance of a particular species may also be caused by certain hazards (e.g. pathogen affecting a specific tree species, such as ash dieback). A global meta-analysis has shown a negative impact of disturbances on most ecosystem services, particularly carbon sequestration. Soil quality and organic content, timber production and water quality are also affected15. Fires, for instance, increase soil erosion, reduce the recreational value of forests, and cause carbon emissions and release volatile compounds that can affect human health. According to a recent estimate, the three main disturbance agents in Europe (storms, fires, bark beetles) currently threaten the provision of forest ecosystem services by 10.4 to 12.3%. In total, 20 million hectares of forest (9.7% of the total area) would see their multifunctionality threatened, particularly in central and western Europe (Figure 3). Figure 3 – Areas affected by high risk of loss of forest ecosystem services in Europe Cette figure comporte des cartes qui montrent où sont situées, en Europe, les forêts dont les services écosystémiques sont le plus menacés par les perturbations naturelles. Les cartes concernent la production de bois, le stockage de carbone, la protection contre l’érosion et l’usage récréatif. This figure contains maps showing where, in Europe, forests have ecosystem services most threatened by natural disturbances. The maps relate to timber production, carbon storage, protection against erosion and recreational use. Reading: the coloured areas correspond to those most affected (beyond the 8th decile) by the risk to the ecosystem service considered. Other areas are also affected, but the level of risk is lower. Source : Lecina Diaz, J., et al., 2024, “Ecosystem services at risk from disturbance in Europe’s forests”, Global Change Biology Natural hazards pose risks to timber production and the wood industry. A major crisis, such as a storm, causes in the short term an influx of lower-quality timber on the market, reducing prices and disrupting trade16. Later, the damage causes a reduction in timber supply and pressure on prices (which rise), potentially lasting for several decades. In the Czech Republic, the 2018 bark beetle crisis caused an increase of 5.3 to 18 million m³ (+340%) in salvaged damaged timber compared with 2017, leading to a drop in timber prices from €55/m³ to €15/m³ (–73%)17. Disturbances also affect the value of forest land. For example, it decreased by an average of 10% between 1984–2003 and 2001–2020 in western US states, due to the multiplication of fires and droughts. Even unburnt areas are affected, to a lesser extent, through a change in risk perception by buyers18. Hazards also pose a risk of non-permanence for carbon stocks mobilised to mitigate climate change. In Europe, in the future, carbon losses linked to natural disturbances could be of the same order of magnitude as the gains expected from forest management aimed at mitigating climate change19. Due to the inherent uncertainty of meteorological phenomena, the forest carbon sink may vary greatly from year to year20. For example, Storm Vaia alone reduced Italy’s forest carbon sink by 4% in 201821. Recovering damaged timber for industry nevertheless makes it possible to transfer part of the carbon to downstream sectors, partially mitigating these consequences. The introduction of new pests could cause further degradation of the carbon sink. Seidl et al.22 estimate that 10% of European forest carbon would be exposed to five major new pests in Europe by 2080 under a high-warming scenario (RCP 8.5). An invasion by these pests would increase carbon losses due to natural hazards from +2.3% (for beech canker) to +50% (for the Asian longhorn beetle, which attacks several hardwood species). Beyond the direct mortality due to hazards, the decline of the carbon sink may also be attributed to the loss of photosynthetic activity by dying trees (Figure 4). Figure 4 – Breakdown of the decline of the French forest carbon sink between 2010 and 2020 Ce diagramme montre l’évolution du puits de carbone forestier en France de 2010 à 2020. On y voit que sa forte baisse est principalement due aux impacts du changement climatique, et notamment aux dépérissements dus aux perturbations naturelles. This diagram shows the evolution of the forest carbon sink in France from 2010 to 2020. It illustrates that its sharp decline is mainly due to the impacts of climate change, in particular dieback caused by natural disturbance. Source : Secrétariat général à la planification écologique, 2023 1 Direct action on hazards is often difficult, but risk can be reduced by lowering the vulnerability of exposed forests. Interventions are possible at different levels. Two examples are presented here: fuel management and the recovery of damaged timber. Many other measures, which we do not develop here, can also contribute to reducing vulnerability: diversification of forest composition and structure, enhanced monitoring, raising awareness among local stakeholders, etc. In forests, the presence of fuel in the understorey (e.g. low vegetation, branches) increases the risk of fire. It raises the probability of fire outbreaks and their ability to intensify and spread. When fuel is dry and continuous, the risk is even greater. Removing this vegetation preventively reduces forest vulnerability, particularly by lowering sensitivity, while also affecting the hazard component. This is, for example, the aim of the legal obligations for clearing undergrowth. These apply, in 43 French departments, to land located within 200 m of forest areas, within a radius of 50 m around buildings. These “wildland-urban” interface zones are particularly vulnerable, due to the high potential for fire outbreaks and the presence of buildings, people and economic activities. Similar measures exist elsewhere, for instance in Catalonia, Spain. In some regions, grazing is used to reduce fuel, through payments for environmental services23. A recent study assessed the impact of forest fuel management in California, where fires caused average annual damage estimated at $117 billion between 2017 and 202124. By 2050, the increase in fire intensity could be offset by the annual treatment of 240,000 hectares. The current target is to treat 400,000 hectares, which would avoid losses of $10.9 billion for an estimated annual cost of $3 billion, while each year of delay in achieving this target would lead to $4 billion in losses. However, according to the economists behind the study, the optimal area to treat to maximise benefits would be 1.6 million hectares per year, four times higher than the current target. Fuel can also be deliberately burnt preventively. Prescribed burning is a preventive measure that reduces the fuel load to prevent fire outbreaks. In France, it is planned by the State, local authorities or their representatives, and carried out by professionals. This practice also helps to maintain the good condition of certain ecosystems. Another solution, tactical fires and backfires, are firefighting techniques used during a blaze. They aim to channel the fire and support firefighting personnel. When storms occur, they generate a sudden influx of damaged timber. Recovering it enables owners to generate income, which is then reinvested in forest management. Being able to commercialise this “crisis timber” improves the adaptive capacity of forests. Conversely, leaving such timber on site increases the likelihood of another crisis (e.g. disease, fire outbreak), raising the sensitivity (and therefore vulnerability) of the stand to potential cascading hazards. Following a major crisis, wood recovery may be coordinated and supported by the State. It mainly involves two methods: storing timber for later processing locally; or exporting it to other regions25. These interventions help to ease pressure on local markets and smooth out negative economic impacts (e.g. price falls). First, an assessment of the damage must be carried out to prioritise operations. Rapid intervention is particularly necessary in the case of disease, to avoid its spread and timber degradation. During storage, timber health can be stabilised by treating it once removed from the forest (heat treatment, fumigation) and by ensuring proper storage conditions (ventilation, distance from forest, contact with the ground). A timber mobilisation plan was implemented in France following Storm Klaus (2009), which destroyed 42.5 million m³ of timber, mainly in the Aquitaine region. It included direct support for timber storage (creation and rehabilitation of storage areas) and transport outside the region, for a total of €126 million. Ultimately, 55% of the 29.5 million m³ of timber harvested post-storm benefited from direct aid. An economic model26 showed that this plan encouraged storage (+25%), accelerated and increased timber recovery (+33%), although it did not prevent the fall in prices (–60% for maritime pine). Over ten years, the plan is estimated to have generated an economic gain of €44 million for the forest-wood sector. An even more storage-focused strategy would have been more beneficial but would have slowed the recovery of prices, to the detriment of local producers. In the future, more damaged timber will be available due to the worsening of disturbance regimes. A recent foresight study27 emphasises the importance of anticipating this dynamic, not only for the economic aspects mentioned above, but also for maintaining the forest carbon sink. Upstream, it will be necessary to increase proactive harvesting of declining timber and prioritise it, in crisis years, over standard harvesting. Downstream, processing and storage capacities will need to be increased. Innovation will also be a key factor, in order to make better use of downgraded timber and, where possible, direct it towards long-life uses (e.g. construction), which are more beneficial from a climate perspective. The vulnerability of forests to natural disturbances, exacerbated by climate change, is a crucial issue for the management of forest ecosystems. This note has clarified the components of risk, distinguishing hazard, vulnerability and the assets associated with forests. Concrete examples show that forests are increasingly exposed to multiple hazards, particularly in Europe, with varied effects on ecosystem services, the forest economy and biodiversity. Adaptation strategies, such as fuel management and the recovery of damaged timber, can mitigate these impacts by reducing forest vulnerability. In the future, the development of a multi-hazard approach and proactive management practices will be crucial. To this end, it will be necessary to rely on clear conceptual frameworks in order to target the different components of risk appropriately. However, uncertainties remain about the complex interactions between the different hazards and the scale of future changes. Further research is needed to refine our knowledge, particularly regarding the impacts of extreme events. Other elements beyond forests are exposed, and potentially vulnerable, to the hazards discussed here. These include populations (fires can harm health through air pollution) and infrastructure (transport, housing, etc.). Any strategy for adapting to “forest” hazards must therefore be cross-sectoral and systemic, looking beyond the forest itself and considering these multiple components.

Title: 20VC x SaaStr This Week: Navan’s “Disappointing” $5B IPO, VCs Getting 6% Instead of 20%, and the Fire-Half-Your-Team AI Test: The New Venture Reality

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts We’re back! Harry, Rory and Jason this week. The venture landscape has fundamentally shifted. A $4.5B exit is no longer enough for mega-funds, ownership targets are getting crushed across the board, and if your SaaS company didn’t see AI-driven reacceleration in 2025, you’ve failed. Meanwhile, the best Series A environment in years is hidden behind pricing pressure, and every “mature” software company better be capturing dollars from the AI spend explosion—or they’re headed for a 3x revenue PE buyout. Navan’s IPO at $700M revenue, 32% growth, and a ~$5B market cap should be a massive win. Instead, it feels like a disappointment. Why? Because mature SaaS companies are now trading at 6-7x NTM revenue — or less — and with fund sizes exploding, VCs need $10B+ outcomes to move the needle. As Jason put it bluntly: “Is a $4.5 billion exit good enough today? It’s a horrible thing to say, but if we’re talking about in VC and inside baseball, it’s a bonafide question.” The math is unforgiving. Lightspeed invested $257M into Navan and returned ~$1B for a 4x blended return. Their early rounds probably returned 20-30x, but following with $200M+ in late-stage capital diluted that spectacular early return down to “just” 4x on the total investment. For a $2B fund, even a billion-dollar return only gets you a third of the way to 1x. Benchmark—the gold standard of ownership discipline—only secured 10% of Mercor at a massive valuation. Jason’s last three deals came in at 6-8% ownership despite his rule being double-digit ownership of two winners per fund. Y Combinator has institutionalized 10% rounds at demo day (3 on 30, 4 on 40), leaving seed VCs scrambling for 5-6% unless they “way overbid and basically do two rounds at once.” The paradox: Both hyper-capital-efficient companies (that don’t need much money) and hyper-capital-inefficient companies (that need billions) result in low ownership for VCs. As Rory noted: “A founder’s optimized fundraising is a VC’s below ownership target.” Jason delivered one of the spiciest takes of the episode: “You better have gotten a few nickels out of the AI expenditures.. Some growth from all that massive AI spend in 2025. If you didn’t, if you’re not growing faster at the end of 2025 than at the start, then as a founder, I give you an F minus.” The data backs him up. Twilio went from single-digit growth to 15% growth fueled by voice AI customers (top 10 voice AI startups up 10x). MongoDB is benefiting from every AI company needing databases. Snowflake has re-accelerated. Stripe is booming from AI customers. Even if you can’t become Harvey, you must co-attach to the AI spend explosion. The window is closing fast. “You had 18 months to ship a product that mattered in this world. Where’s your agent? Where’s your reacceleration? F. No more excuses after Thanksgiving.” Despite the pricing pain, Jason argues Series A is in a golden age: “This is the best of times to be a series A investor because there is just an explosion of seed AI startups… It is a gift that thousands of founders are in San Francisco raising seed funds from multiple accelerators.” The top of funnel has never been better. YC, Neo, South Park Commons, and others are creating an unprecedented pipeline of smart, vetted founders. Yes, competition is fierce—Rory noted losing deals to Andreessen Horowitz and Kleiner Perkins (firms that would have been “slightly early” five years ago). But the direction of travel is clear: “Some form of agentic software… The mission has been assigned.” Buried in the discussion of Navan’s “disappointing” IPO was a striking observation: “The amount of wealth in Silicon Valley is just unprecedented in our lifetimes. It’s just gone up dramatically the last 18 months. In a very concentrated fashion.” This creates a strange dynamic where VCs are getting richer than ever (Oren Zev as a solo investor turned $150M into $1B+, Lightspeed’s $257M became ~$1B) while simultaneously feeling the pressure to deliver even bigger outcomes. A $50M post-seed valuation for a company that “has to be way better than Navan” feels both expensive and necessary. Let’s dig deeper into why Navan’s $5B outcome feels bittersweet. The company survived a near-death experience (COVID wiping out travel), came back strong with $700M+ revenue at 32% growth, and delivered billions to investors. By any historical standard, this is spectacular. But the lockup period reveals the gap between headlines and reality. Typical lockup: 6 months before you can start selling, and 18-24 months to fully distribute a large position. As Rory explained: “The IPO, I mean, it’s significant, but the economic significance is limited.” Translation: Those “billion-dollar returns” reported on IPO day often turn into $700M after 18 months of distribution. Worse, the last private round priced at $9B. Anyone who bought at that valuation or in the IPO is now down 30-50%. As Rory noted, this actually disproves Bill Gurley’s “free money” thesis about IPO pops: “This is an example of an IPO where, you know, if you look at it from the perspective of the issuer of stock, not only did they not leave money on the table, they actually priced at what now looks like a high.” The follow-on concentration strategy amplified returns but also amplified late-stage risk. Lightspeed’s early rounds probably delivered 20-30x, but their $257M total investment (including heavy late-stage follow-on) blended down to ~4x. For Orin Zev’s smaller fund structure with SPVs, the $150M-to-$1B return (6.7x) on a single deal is phenomenal. Same outcome, different fund architecture, wildly different impact. One of the most insightful discussions centered on adoption velocity. OpenEvidence grew to 300,000 doctors in one year—one-tenth the time it took Doximity. Individual adoption of AI tools is explosive. But corporate adoption? Much slower. As Jason observed: “I don’t think everyone’s going to buy Agent Force or their equivalent in a year. It might be 5 years, not 10 like SaaS. It might be half the time of SaaS.” This creates opportunity and risk. Opportunity: If you’re selling to enterprises (Salesforce, HubSpot), you have 5 years to get this right, not 1 year. Risk: Individual users are already using ChatGPT, Cursor, and other tools “legally or illegally.” Every associate is using AI to write briefs whether law firms have adopted Harvey or not. The TAM question becomes critical. OpenEvidence might capture 300K doctors fast, but there are only ~1M doctors in America (half in-house, half external). As Rory warned: “You’ve got to be sure that once you get all the names that you have enough follow-on stories for those names. You don’t want to be one and done.” Harvey faces the same math. To justify an $8B valuation at 30% growth (7x multiple at maturity), they need to hit $3B in revenue. With ~1M lawyers in America, that implies thousands of dollars per lawyer per year in subscription—not impossible (WestLaw is bigger), but a high bar. Speaking of Harvey: $150M ARR, 98% GRR, 170% NDR, 40% DAU/MAU ratio, raised at $8B valuation with minimal dilution (~2% for $150M). Jason’s back-of-napkin math: “If it’s 400 forward revenue that’s 20x. That’s exactly what it is. 400 AR. That’s what they’re predicting.” Rory agreed: These low-dilution rounds at hypergrowth companies are great for early investors but create pressure on the ultimate exit. The bull case: LLMs are perfect for law (language manipulation is literally what lawyers do), Harvey established market leadership fast, and legal had been a “pretty barren place” for software until now. The question mark: Is there a $3B annual spend in software for corporate law practices? Rory’s framework: “You basically have to be such a big automation tool for these lawyers that they’re willing to spend, you know, equivalent dollars, you know, thousands of dollars per year in subscription to make the math work.” Jason’s evolution: “I couldn’t believe that software companies could really capture dollars from replacing humans for real… Now we’re really seeing it. Agents are better than mediocre humans.” His conviction comes from using products, not Powerpoints. He’s running 20+ agents at SaaStr, replacing $40K workers with $10K/year agents, and seeing real results. The discussion of Sam Altman’s response to Brad Gerstner (“if you want to sell your shares, I’ll find someone for you in 60 seconds”) revealed deep concerns about governance and capital requirements. Jason’s reaction: “When that was said to me by a founder, I never said a critical word ever again. I didn’t mean I didn’t realize I pushed too hard. I never said a critical word ever ever again when I was told there’s a market for your shares if you want to sell.” But Rory pushed back: “If you are on the board of a company that’s planning to spend a trillion dollars and you only have 12 billion in revenue. It’s a totally appropriate board level question to say how are we going to do this.” The stakes are enormous: “The health of the entire US economy depends on the answer to this question. It turns out ‘fuck off and sell your shares’ is not an acceptable answer.” OpenAI needs to do $100B+ in revenue by 2027 to support the capex commitments. That’s not just impressive—it’s “hundreds of billions of dollars a year in a world where today only Amazon” operates at that scale. Google does $100B in a quarter; so does Amazon. OpenAI needs to reach that level. Rory’s compassion for Sam: “There’s a little part of me that’s kind of a bit sorry for Sam Altman because of where he’s put himself. He is the poster child of the AI capex boom. And if the AI capex boom unravels and the world and media is looking for a villain to throw rocks at, it ain’t going to be a big search.” The board’s job: “Help the CEO avoid things… provide the guardrails.” When someone invents numbers at the $5-10M level and they’re wrong, they disappear. “When you invent numbers that are wildly overoptimistic at the trillion dollar level and if it unravels, you just become the poster child in every economic history for the next 200 years of the great AI crash of 2026.” AWS: Grew 20% (reacceleration from 13%), secured OpenAI deal as latest partner, but the story is bittersweet. Five years ago, AWS dominated cloud compute. Today, they’re behind Microsoft ($250B commitment), Oracle ($300B), Google, Broadcom ($400B) in the AI race. As Jason noted: “It’s tough from AWS being having really created the category of cloud and being what we all grew up on. It is a major come down to be not even above the fold on the leaderboard.” Google: The underappreciated winner. “Google is really good now at all levels. It’s really good at consumer AI. It’s really good in searches back. Search is growing for Google again. The TPUs are good. It’s a good partner.” Unlike Amazon, Google has the application layer (all the consumer apps we use), the infrastructure layer (TPUs), and is printing money. Stock up 53% from Q1 lows. Meta: Core business performed great (20% growth), but stock dropped double-digits because they’re spending $70B/year on AI with “no revenue attached.” The market’s message: “You have this wonderful business and then you’re taking the entire cash flow and you’re building this AI stuff and unlike Google, Microsoft, or Amazon you don’t have an enterprise business to sell this shit to and unlike ChatGPT you don’t yet have an obvious AI forward app.” Zuck’s response (paraphrased): “I think it’s relevant to be in this space. Thank you for your opinion. I refer you to the Artisan Corporation. I control this company. Have a nice day.” The market’s counter: “Hey you’re doing the thing you did in 2021-22 putting a whole bunch of capex into something that might not work and that’s why the shares are slightly down.” “If I were the CEOs of any of the CRM leaders, I might move on from half my leadership team if I don’t see real growth from AI agents by the middle of next year. Because there’s been enough time. You’ve just got the wrong people.” Why the urgency? Infrastructure companies like Twilio, MongoDB, and Datadog already saw the bump. Companies at the infrastructure layer get the AI spend first. Application layer companies need to prove they can capture it too—or risk being viewed as legacy players who missed the moment. Rory initially pushed back on Jason’s harshness, then came around: “Sometimes when Jason is cruel and harsh, I disagree. And then sometimes I listen and I go, he’s absolutely right. This is one of the latter ones… If you’re not on this train now, you’re just not going to be relevant and you will be sold for three times one-year revenues to a PE firm who will smush you in with something else, never to be seen again.” The contrast with Harvey is stark: Harvey has 2,000 people somewhere building legal AI. Salesforce has 2,000 people building Agent Force. One has 170% NDR and $150M ARR growing like a weed. The other needs to prove monetization in 2026 on a massive enterprise base. The ownership discussion revealed a fundamental tension in portfolio construction. Jason’s rule: “I feel like I can only make money if I own double digits of two winners per fund.” His last three investments: 6-8% despite that rule. His resolution for 2026: “Get my ownership up. We’ll see how I do it.” Rory’s framework on late-stage follow-on: Early-stage funds aim for one deal to return the fund. Late-stage funds play a different game: “We got 4 billion. We’re going to put it to work. The average good deal will be at 3 to 5x. We’ll have a low loss ratio and over time we’ll get our two two and a halfx net. It’s not small numbers of big heads business. It’s a very different business. It’s moving money at scale.” The challenge: When companies are capital-efficient, they don’t need to sell much equity. When they’re capital-inefficient (OpenAI, Anthropic), they need billions, so even $100M buys you only a few points. “Both of those, interestingly enough, would be pretty good deals… Your mental rules of thumb have been smashed to pieces.” Harry’s counter: “You have to turn the next card to see sometimes. And it’s not obviously a $10 billion company on day one. And actually value can accrue in increments over time. And you could miss some great ones by being flippant in being like, oh, it’s not a $10 billion company.” Jason’s response: “If your first check for me is a very large percent of the fund, I don’t have a lot of margin for error. I don’t have the other 145 million that he had in Trip Actions in Navan. For me, that first one has to work.” Jason’s most provocative statement: “I don’t even want to take meetings with mortal founders. I don’t even want to take them, especially if the ask is aggressive.” Context: At $50M post (with everything in), Jason needs a 100x return to make money after dilution. That company needs to be “even better than Navan” to justify the price. “Do I really believe this deal I just did is for sure going to be worth more than Navan? I don’t know. It’s such an insanely high bar.” Rory’s gentle pushback: “I recoil from the ‘I don’t do mortal humans.’ It’s a bit cuz I think, you know, it sounds a little judgy.” Jason’s clarification: “Maybe it was always hard but now like you got to see these 10 billion exits but if they’re not utterly breaking the mold… it’s hard to really believe it’s going to be worth north of 10 billion.” The sobering reality: “You now have to assume that 400 million, 500 million in revenue is the threshold for an IPO. And if you say to yourself that you only want to do deals where you at least have the upside of an IPO, the IPO potential, then the bar to what a doable successful venture-backed deal with upside has gone up.” Rory’s synthesis: “The business has got harder. It has. But also people are getting richer at the same time. The amount of wealth in Silicon Valley is just unprecedented in our lifetimes.” One of the most important exchanges revealed a dirty secret about modern venture boards. Jason: “The better the company is doing, the more everyone’s a grin fucker. There’s just never a critical word said.” His example: “I have a company that’s going batshit and it’s going too batshit… The board members will not intervene in any way to protect the shareholders because of the bad NPS that would come from damaging that founder relationship. That to me is one of the most egregious escapes from fiduciary duty.” Harry agreed: “There is so much fear among VCs of getting out of step with the most successful founders. There’s so much fear.” Rory’s take: “If it were a normal startup with the VCs we work with and they had had to come up with 1.2 trillion, I think everyone would be saying, ‘Sounds good, Sam. Sounds good, Sam. Keep going. Good month.'” The contrast with OpenAI’s actual board: Brett Taylor (likely not a yes-man) and previously Larry Summers (“Larry Summers is many things, but not a yes-man”). Having strong, independent voices matters enormously when the stakes are this high. Jason’s reflection on being told to sell by a founder: “That was a teaching moment for me. I’m like, okay, I crossed the line. Like I didn’t mean I didn’t realize I did.” But Rory’s point stands: “You’re as a board member meant to provide the guardrails. I think when I look at this one, I go, ‘Hm, I hope someone’s providing really good guard rails because if it hits, it’ll hit hard.'” The lesson: Young founders make mistakes, but experienced board members who stay silent are morally (if not legally) more culpable. “Do we really have an audit, Sam Bankman? Do we really know where the money is?” The episode crystallized two viable strategies for software companies navigating the AI transition: Path 1: Go Where Others Aren’t (The Roger Ehrenberg Strategy) As Harry noted: “Let’s go where others aren’t. Get 20% in actually reasonably priced assets. Let’s not do AI dictation tools from YC and get 4%.” This means finding categories with less competition, being willing to take concentrated positions, and having the patience to build ownership over time. The infrastructure layer companies (Twilio, Datadog, MongoDB) benefiting from AI spend without being “AI companies” exemplify this. Path 2: If You’re Slow, Pick Slower Categories Jason’s advice: “Only a couple percent of [Salesforce’s] customer base is fully ready for AI today… If you are a little slow, maybe play to your strengths. If you’re a little slow, maybe maybe go into retail or manufacturing or areas where it hasn’t changed overnight.” The key insight: Individual adoption is explosive (OpenEvidence to 300K doctors in a year). Corporate adoption takes 5 years, not 10, but still takes multiple years. If you’re a smaller team or moving slower, find industries where the decision-making process is naturally slower. But no matter which path you choose, the core message remains: You must be relevant to AI in 2026. Whether that’s replacing humans, automating tasks, or enabling AI workloads, you need a story. Companies without one will get “sold for three times one-year revenues to a PE firm” and disappear. The episode closed with a fascinating debate about prediction markets. Both agreed the space is interesting, but differed on which bet to take. Jason’s lean toward Kalshi: “Based on my limited knowledge, I’m going Kalshi because I feel like it is a safer long-term bet than someone that is riding the current political vibes which are all in favor of everything here.” The risk: “There is a chance there will be a new administration that will be less sympathetic to this category… The first act could be to undo everything everything that Sachs and Buddies have done. That could be the January 1st whatever.” Rory’s prediction: “I predict that any reregulation won’t happen because of any new administration. I think the real challenge to sports betting like this will actually be the leagues themselves wrestling with the fact that when you have sports betting, you have sports cheating.” The Brian Armstrong example: Using specific phrases during an earnings call to tilt the scales on a Kalshi bet creates all sorts of weird incentive problems. “When you have these prediction markets and then the person can tilt, put their finger on the scales of who wins… There’s going to be a lot of weird stuff that happens.” The broader point: Regulatory risk isn’t just about current administration views. It’s about second-order effects (league commissioners dealing with cheating scandals), insider trading concerns (policy bets moving an hour before official announcements), and the fact that “everything is legal” right now doesn’t mean it stays that way. Jason Lemkin: On the exit bar: “The horrible question in venture and startups, it is horrible. Is a $4.5 billion exit good enough today? It’s a horrible thing to say, but if we’re talking about in VC and inside baseball, it’s a bonafide question.” On AI urgency: “You better have gotten a few nickels out of the AI expenditures… If you didn’t, if you’re not growing faster at the end of 2025 than the start as a founder, I give you an F minus. There’s so much money and you don’t have to be Harvey to get a little piece of it.” Rory O’Driscoll: On ownership: “A founder’s optimized fundraising is a VC’s below ownership target. That’s right. If Cursor had needed 40 million to get rolling, then Reedrock would own 20%. If they only need 20 million, then there you are.” On Sam Altman: “There’s a little part of me that’s kind of a bit sorry for Sam Altman because of where he’s put himself. He is the poster child of the AI capex boom, right? And if the AI capex boom unravels and the world and media is looking for a villain to throw rocks at, it ain’t going to be a big search.” Harry Stebbings: On board dynamics: “There is so much fear among VCs of getting out of step with the most successful founders. There’s so much fear. And you guys are going to disagree with me, but I see it all across my portfolio. The better the company is doing, the more everyone’s a grin fucker. There’s just never a critical word said.” On adoption velocity: “OpenEvidence grew to 300,000 doctors in one year, which is one-tenth of the amount of time it took Doximity. That was interesting just in terms of market pull and adoption rate.” Final Thought: The venture landscape going into 2026 is simultaneously the most exciting and most unforgiving it’s ever been. Pricing is high, ownership is compressed, exit expectations are brutal, and the speed of AI adoption creates winners and losers faster than any previous technology shift. But for those who can navigate it—who can find the right companies, get meaningful ownership, help them capture AI spend, and provide real board-level guidance—the wealth creation is unprecedented. Just don’t expect it to be easy, and definitely don’t expect a $5B exit to feel like a win anymore.

Title: Elon Musk awarded nearly $1 trillion pay package by Tesla shareholders

WHIO 7 NOW Tesla shareholders awarded CEO Elon Musk a pay package on Thursday that could grant the tech entrepreneur nearly $1 trillion in compensation over the next decade. The pay package would make Musk the best-compensated CEO ever recorded. According to a securities filing in September, Musk would rake in roughly $900 billion over the duration of the agreement. The full compensation would only be delivered if Musk vaults the company from its present value of $1.1 trillion to $8.5 trillion, a figure that exceeds the current combined market values of Meta, Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet, the filing says. The compensation package also includes a set of production goals, including one million Robotaxis in commercial operation and the delivery of one million humanoid robots over the next 10 years, according to the securities filing. Before Tesla released the results of the shareholder vote, some major shareholders said they had voted down the proposal. Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund said Tuesday that it had voted against the pay package, raising concerns about its scale and potential risks. "While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk’s visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk consistent with our views on executive compensation," Norges Bank Investment Management, the manager of the fund, said in a statement. (NEW YORK) -- Musk, considered the world's richest person, currently boasts a net worth of about $504 billion, according to Forbes. If he were to receive the full pay package, Musk would become the world's first-ever trillionaire. The pay package could also increase Musk's ownership stake in Tesla to as much as 29%. Musk has long pursued a larger ownership stake. “We are at a pivotal juncture in Tesla’s history, and the proposals the Special Committee has carefully designed and the Board has put forward will help determine Tesla’s future,” the company’s website said earlier this week. “If you believe, like us, that Elon is the CEO that can make our ambitious vision a reality, vote NOW.” Online voting among shareholders closed at 11:59 a.m. ET on Wednesday. The company's new compensation package arrives as Musk's previous payment plan remains in legal limbo. Last year, a Delaware judge twice struck down a $50 billion pay package for Musk put forward by the company in 2018. Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Court of Chancery, which litigates corporate governance litigation for companies incorporated in Delaware, initially declared that the negotiations surrounding the package had been inappropriate, due to a lack of independence among board members and problematic influence by Musk over those negotiations. In a second ruling, McCormick decided that an additional shareholder vote on the compensation package -- even if made with full knowledge of the initial problems surrounding the negotiation of the agreement -- could not undo those problems. Musk has appealed the ruling. Tesla announced a 12% jump in revenue over the third quarter in October, snapping a streak of two consecutive quarters of falling sales. Still, earnings fell short of analysts’ expectations, causing a drop in the stock price. Overall, shares of Tesla have climbed about 16% this year, putting them roughly in line with a jump in the S&P 500 over that period. Musk's work as a “special government employee” with the Trump administration, which ended in May, set off demonstrations at Tesla dealerships worldwide in protest of his effort to slash government spending as leader of the Department of Government Efficiency. On an earnings call in June, Musk fielded a question about his control of the company, which a Morgan Stanley analyst said was 13%. "As I mentioned before, I think my control of Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction, but not so much control that I can't be thrown out if I go crazy," Musk said in jest.

Musk would become the best-compensated CEO ever. Tesla shareholders awarded CEO Elon Musk a pay package on Thursday that could grant the tech entrepreneur nearly $1 trillion in compensation over the next decade. The pay package would make Musk the best-compensated CEO ever recorded. According to a securities filing in September, Musk would rake in roughly $900 billion over the duration of the agreement. Approval of the compensation package received more than 75% of the shareholder vote, Tesla General Counsel Brandon Erhart said during the shareholder meeting on Thursday. The full compensation would only be delivered if Musk vaults the company from its present value of $1.1 trillion to $8.5 trillion, a figure that exceeds the current combined market values of Meta, Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet, the filing says.

Title: Is the AI boom losing steam as investors grow wary of returns?

Billions have poured into AI, helping stock valuations soar. But the cracks are starting to show. Slowing adoption, surging costs and elusive profits are fueling warnings that the boom may be headed for a hard reset. The artificial intelligence (AI) party is still in full swing, with tens of billions globally pouring into infrastructure, startups and attracting the best talent. Among the headline announcements this year: ChatGPT parent company Open AI, Softbank and Oracle pledged to invest $500 billion (€433 billion) in AI supercomputers, Open AI and chip giant Nvidia announced a $100 billion fund to maintain the United States' dominance in advanced chips, while Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Tencent hiked investments to help speed up China's ambition to lead AI by 2030. Since ChatGPT’s debut in November 2022, AI-related stocks have added an estimated $17.5 trillion in market value, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, driving around 75% of the S&P 500’s gains and propelling companies like Nvidia and Microsoft to record-breaking valuations. But signs of a hangover are getting harder to ignore. AI usage by corporations is slipping, spending is tightening and the machine learning hype has massively outpaced the profits. Many economists think usage concerns, barely three years into AI going mainstream, dropkick the prevailing narrative that AI would revolutionize how businesses operate by streamlining repetitive tasks and improving forecasting. "The vast bet on AI infrastructure assumes surging usage, yet multiple US surveys show adoption has actually declined since the summer," Carl-Benedikt Frey, professor of AI & work at the UK's University of Oxford, told DW. "Unless new, durable use cases emerge quickly, something will give — and the bubble could burst." The US Census Bureau, which surveys 1.2 million US companies every fortnight, found that AI-tool usage at firms with more than 250 employees dropped from nearly 14% in June to under 12% in August. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video AI’s biggest challenge remains its tendency to hallucinate — generating plausible but false information. Other weaknesses are inconsistent reliability and the poor performance of autonomous agents, which complete tasks successfully only about a third of the time. "Unlike an intern who learns on the job, today’s pretrained [AI] systems don’t improve through experience. We need continual learning and models that adapt to changing circumstances," said Frey. As the gap widens between sky-high expectations and commercial reality, investor enthusiasm for AI is starting to fade. In the third quarter of the year, venture-capital deals with private AI firms dropped by 22% quarter on quarter to 1,295, although funding levels remained above $45 billion for the fourth consecutive quarter, market intelligence firm CB Insights wrote last month. "What perturbs me is the scale of the money being invested compared to the amount of revenue flowing from AI," economist Stuart Mills, a senior fellow at the London School of Economics, told DW. Market leader OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft, generated $3.7 billion in revenue last year, versus total operating expenses of $8-9 billion. The company says it is on course to make $13 billion this year but is still expected to burn through $129 billion before 2029, news site The Information calculated in September. Mills thinks generative AI companies like Elon Musk's Grok and ChatGPT are "charging far less than they need to make a profit" and should raise subscription prices. Few have quantified the AI bubble more starkly than Julien Garran, partner at UK-based research firm MacroStrategy Partnership. He argues that the sheer volume of capital flowing into AI — despite little evidence of sustainable returns — dwarfs previous speculative frenzies. "We estimate a misallocation of capital equivalent to 65% of US GDP — four times bigger than the housing buildup before the 2008/9 financial crisis and 17 times bigger than the dot-com bust," Garran told DW. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Recent earnings from Big Tech have sparked cautious optimism, but also fresh doubts about AI’s staying power. Data analytics and intelligence platform Palantir's Q3 revenue surged 63% year-over-year, but its stock price fell by up to 7% on the news. AMD and Meta also saw their strong AI-related earnings overshadowed by market concerns about sustainability. That disconnect between soaring valuations and shaky fundamentals is exactly what worries Mills, who sees a widening gap between what AI promises and what it actually delivers to businesses. "The data suggests that AI is not penetrating high enough up the value chain. Loads of people are using it, but it's not being used for tasks that directly contribute to value production," he told DW. Nvidia's upcoming earnings on November 19 may prove a key test of whether the AI boom still has legs. In the second quarter, Nvidia's data center sales alone made up 88% of total revenue, which hit a record $46.7 billion. For Q3, the company has guided $54 billion, projecting 54% year-on-year growth, which would equate to a full-year total of more than $200 billion. "With the exception of Nvidia, which is selling shovels in a gold rush, most generative AI companies are both wildly overvalued and wildly overhyped," Gary Marcus, Emeritus Professor of Psychology and Neural Science at New York University, told DW. "My guess is that it will all fall apart, possibly soon. The fundamentals, technical and economic, make no sense." Garran, meanwhile, believes the era of rapid progress in large language models (LLMs) is drawing to a close, not because of technical limits, but because the economics no longer stack up. "They [AI platforms] have already hit the wall," Garran said, adding that the cost of training new models is "skyrocketing, and the improvements aren’t much better." Striking a more positive tone, Sarah Hoffman, director of AI Thought Leadership at the New York-based market intelligence firm AlphaSense, predicted a "market correction" in AI, rather than a "cataclysmic 'bubble bursting.'" After an extended period of extraordinary hype, enterprise investment in AI will become far more discerning, Hoffmann told DW in an emailed statement, with the focus "shifting from big promises to clear proof of impact." "More companies will begin formally tracking AI ROI [return on investment] to ensure projects deliver measurable returns," she added. Edited by: Uwe Hessler

Title: Mark Zuckerberg Drops To Sixth-Richest After Meta Stock Slides

ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. Mark Zuckerberg’s net worth was reduced by nearly $5 billion as Meta shares declined on Thursday, dropping him among the ranks of the world’s wealthiest after Reuters reported Meta projected a chunk of revenue would come from running advertisements for scams. Shares of Meta dropped 2.3% to around $620.75 as of Thursday morning, adding to a roughly 17.5% slide for the stock over the last week, which includes a single-day drop of more than 11% after Meta posted third-quarter earnings. Zuckerberg, who was ranked the world’s third-richest person early last week behind Oracle’s Larry Ellison ($298.8 billion) and Tesla’s Elon Musk ($496.5 billion), respectively, now ranks behind No. 3 Jeff Bezos ($257 billion), No. 4 Larry Page ($235 billion) and No. 5 Sergey Brin ($217.9 billion). Zuckerberg, who holds roughly 13% equity in Meta, had his net worth reduced by $4.6 billion (2.1%) as Meta’s shares dropped. Reuters reported Thursday, citing internal company documents, that Meta projected 10% of overall revenue—estimated at $16 billion—would come from running advertisements for scams and banned goods. Meta spokesperson Andy Stone told Reuters the documents cited by the outlet “present a selective view that distorts Meta’s approach to fraud and scams,” noting the company’s internal estimates were lower and that the 10% estimate included “many” legitimate ads.” Stone declined to give an updated figure to Reuters (Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment to Forbes). Other documents indicated Meta was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for running ads for financial scams, Reuters reported. Regulators in the U.K. reported in 2023 that Meta’s products were involved in 54% of all payment-related scam losses that year, more than double all other social platforms combined.

Title: AI fatigue detected: 4 recent developments show the stock market's driving engine is at a crossroads

Every time Joe publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Good morning and welcome to First Trade. The Supreme Court is skeptical about President Trump's tariffs. It's still early innings, but watch this space for what this means about the future of the market. Rundown But first, traders are getting tired. Love Business Insider? Log into Google and make us a preferred source. Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up now Market musings The old saying goes that something happening once is an accident, twice is a coincidence, and three times is a pattern. Given developments in the AI space in recent days, it looks like we have a full-fledged pattern of skepticism. It's created an inflection point of sorts for a trade that seemed unstoppable as recently as last Tuesday, the last time the S&P 500 closed at record highs. Yes, stocks are coming off a strong day, but it feels like something has shifted under the surface. While three makes a pattern, I'll do you one better. Detailed below are four examples of AI exhaustion, in reverse chronological order, dating back one week: 1. Michael Burry comes out of hibernation to short some giants If Burry is emerging from the woodwork, you know something is afoot. The legendary "Big Short" investor dusted off his X account this week to compare the AI boom to the dot-com bubble. He also disclosed short wagers against market darlings Nvidia and Palantir. While Burry has made a series of bearish bets in recent years that haven't come to fruition, he certainly knows his way around an unsustainable bubble, and his views are an important contribution to the broader groundswell. 2. Sky-high valuations suddenly matter When Wall Street CEOs gathered at an investment summit in Hong Kong this week, few expected the high-profile guests to take a two-by-four to bullish stock portfolios. But that's exactly what Morgan Stanley's Ted Pick and Goldman Sachs' David Solomon did. They warned of a 10-20% drawdown in equities, characterizing it as a necessary and normal consolidation. In a different environment, the comments might've passed without incident. But with investors starting to question AI valuations, it confirmed some latent worries. On this same subject… 3. Palantir sells off big after crushing every conceivable earnings metric A record quarter? Meh. An increased profit forecast? Yawn. All anyone seemed to care about after Palantir's third-quarter earnings was how absurd the company's valuation was, with the stock up 174% year to date. The actual results rendered were irrelevant, offering a clear sign of exhaustion, and a desire from investors to regroup and reassess. 4. Meta's AI-spending pledge sends its stock tanking Loyal readers of First Trade will recognize this as a familiar trope that's been mentioned a handful of times already. Well, it really is that big of a deal. You know the story by now: Meta — already spending tens of billions on AI — said it plans to spend even more in 2026. That might've excited investors a few months ago, but this time around the forecast landed with a thud, and the stock tumbled. The message from investors was clear: we want tangible results, not an opaque money pit. Not convinced? Allow me to offer a visual aid that's specific to OpenAI's role in the fervor. The headline takeaway from this chart is how much Oracle's stock has come back down after a 36% single-day spike on Sept. 10, which was driven by giant new AI-cloud deals and the future revenue they could bring. That day, Oracle announced almost half a trillion dollars in new cloud contracts. A big chunk of that was from an OpenAI deal to develop data-center capacity. OpenAI essentially played kingmaker, as it has so much lately. Since then, OpenAI has unveiled a string of other giant AI infrastructure agreements. With doubts creeping in about OpenAI's ability to pay for all this, investors are discounting these deals. Hence the drop in Oracle shares. This recurring section will highlight individuals who have dominated the week in markets. This week's First Trade MVP is Miriam Adelson, the widow of Sheldon Adelson, founder and chairman of the casino company Las Vegas Sands, of which she and her family own a half-stake. This week's entry would be more aptly titled "MVP of the past two weeks," because LVS has been on a 24% tear over that period, since earnings after the closing bell on Oct. 22. That includes a 5% increase this week. LVS beat revenue forecasts, and saw especially strong growth at its Marina Bay Sands resort, which contributed to a 56% year-over-year sales increase for Singapore operations. The move has lifted Adelson's net worth to $39.9 billion, making her (and her family) the 45th-richest person in the world, according to Forbes data. And did I mention that she's the majority owner of the Dallas Mavericks? No word on how she feels about trading Luka Dončić for pennies. Business Insider's Will Edwards highlights investing recommendations pegged to the biggest trends in markets. One of the biggest questions in the market right now is how effective AI will be in raising profit margins. Tech firms are dumping tens of billions of dollars a year into building out infrastructure to support the technology, helping to propel US economic growth and stock-market gains. But will it ever pay off? For one company, the answer is already yes. And its stock is already seeing the benefits in a big way. Shares of CH Robinson (CHRW), a freight logistics firm, are up 49% year-to-date. After the company's third-quarter earnings report last week, the stock jumped about 20% in a single day. The stock is moving so dramatically because the company has begun using generative AI, said Travis Prentice, the founder of the Informed Momentum Company. AI is able to provide price quotes, book appointments, respond to emails, and process orders for the firm, allowing its shipments per person per day to have increased by 40% since 2022. Meanwhile, CH Robinson has reduced its employee base by more than 10%, boosting margins amid a 12% decline in expenses. "Not the most sexy business in the world, but when everyone talks about AI and there's no ROI with AI, this is a massive exception to the rules," Prentice told BI. "It's driving productivity gains of like 40-50%." "That's a story that no one's really talking about — AI is actually improving business operations," he continued. "They're one of the outliers, but I'm sure there's gonna be a lot to follow when they see the gains that they're having." — Will Edwards Joe Ciolli, executive editor and anchor, in Chicago.

The companies plan to roll out the Perplexity search engine in early 2026, per the release. A Perplexity spokesperson told Business Insider that user data from Snapchat would not be used for training its AI. "Our goal is to make AI more personal, social, and fun — woven into the fabric of your friendships, Snaps, and conversations," Snap's CEO, Evan Spiegel, said in the release. On Wednesday, Snap reported third-quarter revenue of $1.51 billion, a 10% increase compared to the same period last year. Its monthly active users increased 7% year-over-year to 943 million. Snap's stock price surged more than 17% in after-hours trading on Wednesday. Shares are down more than 35% this year. The Perplexity-Snapchat tieup follows the lead of other social media platforms, such as Meta and X, that have integrated AI chatbots into their app interfaces. In April 2024, Meta introduced the Meta AI chatbot on its applications, including Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. The chatbot received mixed reviews from users, some of whom complained about it being activated unnecessarily and hindering the app experience. In December, Elon Musk's X launched the Grok chatbot on its app for all free users, which he called a "politically incorrect" alternative to other chatbots. The Perplexity deal comes as Snap is seeing a change in how its users interact. Spiegel said on Wednesday's earnings call that there has been an "engagement shift from things like friend stories to content posted on Spotlight." Spotlight is Snapchat's public discover page, where users can view short, entertaining videos, similar to TikTok's "For You Page," or Instagram's Reels. The company plans to introduce features like games and conversation starters to reignite connections between users. Jump to

Pinterest stock plunged 20% after reporting weak Q3 2025 earnings and issuing a disappointing holiday outlook. The social media giant’s adjusted EPS missed estimates, while North American ad revenue slowed sharply, erasing its 2025 gains. Despite hitting a record 498 million monthly users, investor focus shifted to declining monetization and margins. Adding pressure, Meta’s $70–72 billion AI spending plan spooked markets over profitability risks. Pinterest closed below $31, its lowest level this year, as ad slowdown fears hit social media stocks broadly.

Title: Bank of America prioritizes bigger AI initiatives, as annual spending on new tech increased by 44% over the past decade

Time Published: 2025-11-05T19:30:06Z

John Kell is a contributing writer for Fortune and author of Fortune’s CIO Intelligence newsletter. Bank of America’s annual spending on new, strategic technology initiatives, which includes investments in artificial intelligence, has increased by 44% over the past decade to reach $4 billion in 2025. The executive that’s steering those investments is Hari Gopalkrishnan, a 14-year veteran who was promoted to serve as the chief technology and information officer in late July. Today at Bank of America’s investor day event, Gopalkrishnan will outline the vision for these strategic tech bets and discuss how they tie into the broader $118 billion in tech investments that the company has made over the past decade. It is the first time leadership has held this event in 15 years and Gopalkrishnan, CEO Brian Moynihan, and other C-suite leaders will face investors as Bank of America’s stock has lagged the five other large U.S. banks for the past five years. “We have steadily increased our spend in technology, now up to $13 billion a year, of which $4 billion goes into strategic growth,” Gopalkrishnan tells Fortune ahead of his one-hour investor day panel discussion with two other Bank of America technologists. “We leverage across the enterprise, so every dollar you spend gets the maximum bang for the buck, as opposed to sort of being siloed by line of business.” That means that when Gopalkrishnan deploys new AI tools and functionality, he will prioritize applications that can scale across all eight lines of business, which includes global capital markets, consumer lending, and retail banking. One example of this in action is Erica, an AI virtual assistant that’s surpassed three billion client interactions since the tool launched in 2018. It now averages more than 58 million interactions per month, facilitating chatbot conversations with clients, proactively altering them on changes to their past spending patterns or flagging when they may have been double-charged by a merchant, and answering banking questions. The tool is currently available on Bank of America’s mobile app, but will expand next year to the desktop. In 2020, Bank of America launched Erica for Employees, an internal version of the tool that more than 90% of the company’s global workforce of 213,000 now uses regularly. Erica has helped reduce the number of calls into the company’s IT service desk by 50%. The banking sector has embraced generative AI capabilities at a faster pace than most sectors, with investments focused on AI-enabled chatbots, virtual assistants that can summarize financial documents, fraud monitoring, and assisting employees as they navigate complex international regulatory changes. Generative, predictive, and other forms of AI collectively are projected to generate as much as $340 billion annually in value creation for the global banking sector, consulting giant McKinsey has estimated. Financial giants, including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, have also been steadily rolling out new generative AI tools to more employees throughout 2025. At Bank of America, Gopalkrishnan says he’s less incentivized to focus his investments on AI tools that can save a couple minutes on simplistic workplace tasks. “When you look at the end-to-end client journey, they involve like 40-plus processes and thousands of employees,” says Gopalkrishnan. “You start to pick apart that process and reimagine it. That’s when you get ROI.” Bank of America has explored more than 45 different “proof of concept” use cases for generative AI , with 15 of them commercially live today. Some of the priority use cases that Gopalkrishnan is deploying include tools that can summarize or offer search functionality for capital markets and investment banking employees, making it easier to pull real-time market commentary. An in-house built “AskGPS” tool, which was trained on over 3,200 internal documents and presentations, allows employees to ask complex questions on behalf of clients and receive responses within seconds. Bank of America has also invested $1.5 billion into the company’s data capabilities over the past five years, which Gopalkrishnan says was critical to create a foundation that allowed for more AI adoption. Within the technology department, Gopalkrishnan has deployed AI coding assistants that are used by 18,000 developers. There has already been a 20% productivity lift to select parts of the development life cycle that Bank of America has focused its efforts on. Gopalkrishnan says he’s mostly leaning on one unnamed vendor to support AI-enabled code assistance, but is continuing to explore other tools on a smaller scale. His intent is to standardize the application of these AI coding tools over time to as few vendors as possible. More than 130,000 Bank of America employees are currently authorized to use the enterprise productivity tools and by the end of the year, everyone will have access to them. Bank of America has sought to motivate its workforce by offering AI learning programs that begin by teaching the basics of AI, but also more advanced prompt engineering training. “It’s really a combination of training, education, giving them exposure to the tools, and then ongoing commitment to reskill, as the work changes,” says Gopalkrishnan. John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. Tech earnings highlight cracks in AI’s valuation halo. Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon have all spent billions to support their AI initiatives—and all four told investors last week that they will increase spending even more in 2026. Investors have consistently supported the AI boom over the past few years, though that enthusiasm showed some notable cracks in the latest earnings season, as Microsoft and Meta Platforms both saw their stocks fall amid concerns for the lofty levels of spending needed to support their AI ambitions. What’s vexing investors is: AI is generating billions of dollars in revenue and bottom-line efficiencies, but exactly how much, at what pace, and at what price? That investment thesis still needs time to marinate as these tech giants have added debt to support their AI spending. OpenAI strikes a big compute deal with Amazon; projects massive revenue growth. On Monday, OpenAI inked a deal to buy $38 billion worth of compute from Amazon and will immediately start to access Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The partnership is notable as it is one of OpenAI’s first big moves away from Microsoft, who the AI startup had an exclusive cloud agreement with up until this year. Separately, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman indicated more bullish expectations for revenue growth, sharing that annual revenue is “well more” than reports of $13 billion a year. When asked by the Bg2 Pod about revenue estimates exceeding $100 billion a year by 2028 or 2029, Altman responded: “How about ‘27?” Nvidia makes history as the first-ever company worth $5 trillion. Last week, AI chipmaker Nvidia officially became the world’s first company to achieve a market capitalization north of $5 trillion, pulling ahead of tech rivals like Microsoft and Apple, who are each worth close to $4 trillion. The latest stock market gains came after Nvidia’s GTC developer conference, where CEO Jensen Huang disclosed that the company had secured more than $500 billion in orders for its AI chips through the end of next year. Major new deals that have been unveiled the past several days have included partnerships with Eli Lilly, Uber Technologies, and Johnson & Johnson. Bloomberg reports that Nvidia is now larger than six of the 11 sectors in the S&P 500 index and the entire value of equity markets of most countries. Hiring spree: AI companies are seeking more “forward-deployed engineers.” This year, job advertisements have been soaring for a new specialist software developer who can write code, but also is adept at talking to customers. By hiring more forward-deployed engineers, AI hyperscalers like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Cohere would aim to make their AI models more specialized and useful for companies, thus generating bigger contracts and more revenue. The Financial Times reports that job advertisements for these roles have increased more than 800% between January and September of 2025, citing data from the jobs platform Indeed. Firms that prioritize AI governance are also generating stronger returns from their investments. A recent EY survey of 975 C-suite leaders across 21 countries found that while nearly every company had already suffered financial losses from AI-related incidents—with average damages “conservatively” exceeding $4.4 million—the enterprises that had stronger governance measures like real-time monitoring and oversight committees were seeing far fewer damages. And notably, those organizations are also seeing stronger returns from their AI investments: 34% more likely to see improvements in revenue growth and 65% more likely to produce cost savings. “When I look at that data, what it tells me is that those companies are taking AI more seriously,” says Joe Depa, EY’s global chief innovation officer. “That means they’re likely training and talking about how to leverage AI, both ethically, but also from a productivity standpoint.” The survey also found that members of the C-suite may still be struggling to keep up with the rapid pace of change as AI technologies advance. On average, when asked to identify the appropriate controls against five AI-related risks, including hallucinations and bias, only 12% of the C-suite respondents answered correctly. CTOs and CIOs did the best (26% and 24%, respectively), while chief operating officers (6%) and chief marketing officers (3%) were at the bottom of the list.

Title: 4 signs that investors are rethinking the red-hot AI trade

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Investors hit the brakes on the AI trade this week. The market doesn't seem as confident about AI as it once was, evidenced by the sell-off that tore through the sector on Tuesday. Top leaders in the AI sector — including Nvidia, Meta, and Palantir — all tumbled, thanks largely to concerns that tech stocks have gone too far, too fast after years of stellar returns. The hype, in other words, doesn't seem as limitless as it did just a few weeks ago. Here were the warning signs the AI trade got from investors this week: Michael Burry broke a long period of silence to deliver a warning. After a two-year hiatus from social media, the famed "Big Short" investor made a cryptic post on X, where he occasionally issues warnings about the market and the economy to his followers. "Sometimes, we see bubbles," Burry wrote this week. "Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play." Burry's firm, Scion Asset Management, also placed bets against AI titans Palantir and Nvidia in the last quarter, according to a regulatory filing on Monday. "Investors are sitting on huge stock market gains, and some might have taken profits today, especially in AI-related stocks, in response to Burry's filing news," Ed Yardeni, the president of Yardeni Research, wrote in a note. Burry, who was one of the investors to call the housing bust ahead of the 2008 crisis, has a reputation for his persistently bearish takes on markets. In recent years, he's sounded the alarm about a potential stock crash and a recession, battling against consensus forecasts of continued strength and more gains ahead for stocks. Investors have begun paying attention to the elephant in the room: tech stocks have risent to meteoric valuations. That's been a concern in the market for years, but the discussion around whether some firms in the AI space are overvalued seemed to be front and center this week as investors surveyed the market after a breathless three-year rally since the debut of ChatGPT. Here were some of the biggest declines in the tech sector since the closing bell on Friday: Nvidia: -1.08% Palantir: -8.35% AMD: -2.42% Broadcom: -1.85% Meta: -1.89% Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon fanned valuation concerns when he speculated that the market could be heading toward a correction this week. "It's likely there'll be a 10 to 20% drawdown in equity markets sometime in the next 12 to 24 months," he said, speaking at the Financial Leaders' Investment Summit in Hong Kong. "We should also welcome the possibility that there would be drawdowns, 10 to 15% drawdowns that are not driven by some sort of macro cliff effect," Ted Pick, the CEO of Morgan Stanley, also said at the event. The decline in Palantir stock on Tuesday marked a significant moment in the debate over valuations. The firm beat on earnings and revenue in the third quarter, reporting $1.18 billion in revenue for the last three-month period, ahead of the expected $1.09 billion. Despite the upbeat results and confident guidance, the stock tanked 8% after the report, as investors decided that after a blistering rally in 2025, the stock looked too rich. "All of a sudden, we are starting to see some Tech heavyweights fail to live up to investor expectations," David Rosenberg, the president of Rosenberg Research, wrote in a client note. "Even a company like Palantir has seen its share price hammered, even though its results did top expectations — nosebleed valuations got in the way." Meta stock has declined after the tech giant reported earnings and said it would double down on capex spending. Last week, the Facebook parent said it could spend $70 billion to $72 billion this year on AI capex, up from its prior guidance of $66 billion to $72 billion. It also said capex was expected to increase in 2026. Shares of Meta dropped as much as 14% on Thursday in a sign that investors are growing skeptical over the huge amounts of cash being thrown on AI. Its stock has continued to decline, trading 1.2% lower from Friday's close. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Apple are on track to spend around $349 billion on capex this year, according to Business Insider's latest analysis of company statements. "It's a yellow flag," Peter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research, told BI of the sell-off in Meta. "If you don't get that best-case scenario, you're going to have pretty significant write-offs. Jump to

The Galaxy XR headset launched just a few weeks ago in the US and South Korea with a $1,800 price tag. Samsung also launched a pair of controllers for its XR headset for an additional $250 or $175. However, shortly after the headset went live, these controllers were sold out due to high demand in the U.S. The good news is that the Korean OEM has been busy restocking the controllers for the past few days. Considering people who've added the item to their wishlist or clicked on the "Notify me" button on Samsung's website are receiving emails stating that the" Galaxy XR controllers are back in stock." The email further stated that "We have good news. An item you asked us to track is back in stock. Act fast, supplies are still limited." Samsung appears to be working on bringing back these popular controllers, but it seems like only select individuals in the U.S. have so far received restock notifications, while Samsung's official website still says these controllers are currently out of stock, with a "It’s not you. It’s us. We can’t make them fast enough." While Samsung has been clear that the Galaxy XR headset's sole purpose isn't just gaming, like the Meta Quest series. However, without these controllers, it would be tough to dive into more immersive VR games or PC-VR content, as these games simply won't work without them. The controllers are supposedly very ergonomic and are equipped with 6 DoF tracking technology and analog sticks, which deliver precise interactions in the 3D space for enhanced experiences. The Galaxy XR headset could be used for other things like mixed-reality experiences, productivity tools, or even entertainment. This is definitely a setback as users won't be able to experience the headset's other core functionality. For now, gaming enthusiasts have to wait it out and make do by operating the Galaxy XR with a mix of hand gestures, eye-tracking, and voice commands powered by Samsung and Google’s collaborative software, as the company plays catch up.

Title: Wall Street execs say the AI stocks dominating the market will soon be split into winners and losers

Sign up now Market musings Stock valuations — seen by many as flying too close to the sun — took a hit on Tuesday after a chorus of bank execs spoke up to throw their weight behind that view. Chief among them were Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon. Major indexes ended the day firmly in the red, led lower by the same AI-affiliated tech names largely responsible for recent records. While jarring, this commentary was hardly surprising. The execs were simply pointing out an age-old market truism: sometimes stocks have to go down and reset before continuing their ascent. Instead, the most interesting takeaway came from what Pick said about 2026, namely that there will be more dispersion. In simpler terms, the Morgan Stanley chief is saying investors will eventually start separating the wheat from the chaff. Higher-quality companies with strong balance sheets and superior financials will reign supreme, leaving the have-nots in the dust. A sign of how this could play out in AI happened last week, when Meta's stock price took it on the chin after the company pledged to boost capex spending beyond already-lofty levels in 2026. Compare that to the relatively mild reaction in Microsoft shares, despite them saying basically the same thing. Amazon is still pouring money into AI as well, and its stock was up double digits on earnings. A main reason? Meta is far less diversified than its AI-focused peers. It doesn't have a legacy cash-cow business like software or cloud computing to insulate it from the twists and turns of the AI trade. Simply put, the companies with the most air-tight financial situations outperform when things get chaotic. Look at the dot-com bubble for a more extreme example. Countless companies went belly-up, unable to deliver on the market's valuation hype. But an elite group of high-quality companies stayed the course and emerged from the wreckage: Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Cisco, and Intel, just to name a handful. That's dispersion in action. So how can you play the theme in your own portfolio? Lisa Shalett, CIO of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, recently made some recommendations for quality-seeking investors wary of market bifurcation: Speculative booms are all fun and games until they're suddenly not. Making these shifts can help you proactively play defense against a valuation-driven reckoning. Bitcoin has tumbled from all-time highs reached in early October, falling as much as 20% from its peak to below $100,000 on Tuesday. It was the first time since June that the formerly red-hot crypto fell beneath the six-figure threshold. The drop can be attributed to two main things. First, there was a historic unwinding of bitcoin long positions on Oct. 10 that saw investors liquidate $19 billion across exchanges in less than 24 hours. That was an inflection point of sorts. Second, it's suffered from an overall risk-off move that was also seen in stocks on Tuesday. Bitcoin has traded as a risk asset for months, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's non-committal approach to a December rate cut has spooked investors. This chart puts the valuation worries outlined above in context. As megacap stocks have made up a growing percentage of the S&P 500, their sales have not kept pace. In the name of preparing for increased market dispersion, it might be a good idea for investors to identify which companies have actually seen revenue keep rising alongside their share prices. This is exactly the type of high-quality attribute Morgan Stanley has recommended traders rotate into. Culture confidential Business Insider's Will Edwards spotlights a hot trend dominating Wall Street and the finance industry. If there's one piece of clothing that's become synonymous with the finance industry, it's the vest. Stroll around Manhattan at lunchtime on any given weekday, and you'll see swarms of sleeveless coats in all their glory. Their ubiquity earned a nickname years ago: the Midtown uniform. It's become an internet meme, the first item in a finance bro starter pack, and eyeroll fodder for hipsters who dislike all things basic. So, with the vest way past the peak of its hype cycle, why are they still such a staple on Wall Street? I hit the streets to find out. One common reason I heard is that bankers simply like to flex — not necessarily their visible arms, but where they work — as many firms give out branded vests. "It's an earned status thing. You put in a lot of work to get to equity research for your team, to get to the PM role for a team, to be able to get to that said firm," one analyst told me. "That's why you wear it." There's also an element of fitting in. Wearing a vest is a shorthand signal that you're part of the club. That's why people even wear them in the office, out of the elements, said Jonathan Grossman, who is two years into working at UBS. "They want to look cool," he said. "They want to look part of the act." Those in finance-adjacent industries like commercial real estate have also started wearing vests. Despite its casual nature, a vest lends you a degree of credibility with financial industry clients, said Laz Rabanales, who works at Okada & Company. "I'm not a banker, I'm a commercial real-estate agent, and I kind of want to appeal to that industry," Rabanales said. "When you're dressed as that person, then they'll most likely want to talk with you and work with you." But there's not always a deeper meaning. As one banker succinctly explained: "It's cold out." — Will Edwards Joe Ciolli, executive editor and anchor, in Chicago. Akin Oyedele, deputy editor, in New York.
