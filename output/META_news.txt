Title: Is this TV's endgame? A discussion with analyst Rich Greenfield.

The TV business is not slowing down this summer: Any day now, David and Larry Ellison will finally buy Paramount, with its collection of once-storied TV networks like CBS and MTV. A few weeks later, ESPN and Fox — the last two big TV players that haven't launched their own streamers — will launch their own streamers. But on the other hand, the TV business has been slowing down for a decade: Every quarter, more cable TV subscribers cut the cord, or never sign up for a cord in the first place. The people who own cable TV networks don't seem to have any plan to deal with the issue, other than trying to sell their cable TV networks. Lightshed analyst Rich Greenfield has been chronicling the industry's massive, internet-driven change for years. I caught up with him on my Channels podcast to talk through the particular challenges — and perhaps some opportunities — facing TV right now. Here's an edited excerpt of our chat. Peter Kafka: When the music business collapsed back in the Napster era, it happened basically overnight. But TV has hung on for much longer, even though consumer behavior changed pretty significantly over the last decade. Is there something specific about the TV industry that's allowed these guys to move in slow motion? Rich Greenfield: There's very few businesses where you can raise the price on a product that consumers are using less and less every day. The brilliance of the cable TV business model was the big fat bundle. It's a pretty incredible business to put all of these channels together, even if people don't want most of them. It had everything you wanted and no alternatives, which is very different than where we are today. One of my soapboxes is when I hear people saying they wish we could go back to the cable days. And I keep saying, that was terrible. You guys forget. Everyone hated that. I think consumers are pretty adept at managing their services, and I don't hear a lot of complaints. Sometimes it's like, "Where is this game?" Or "How do I find this thing?" It can be a little confusing. But think about your cellphone. You've had one for quite a while now. Managing the apps and deleting something if you're not using it and adding something —these are all pretty easy functions. We don't give consumers enough credit. They're pretty adept at figuring out cheaper solutions and ways to manage. I want to ask you about a few specific companies. The Paramount deal is finally going to close. What do you think the new owners — David Ellison and his father, Larry Ellison — will do once they have control? Will it change overnight, or is this a slow-rolling thing? It will certainly change. The juxtaposition is sort of amazing. [Paramount, under current owner Shari Redstone, is a] financially strapped company, with challenged financial ownership. And you're moving to an ownership team that is one of the wealthiest families on planet Earth. David Ellison is probably going to be running this company for 30, 40 years. He obviously has a passion for entertainment. He's moving to a much bigger stage. But this is still a financially struggling company. He can't fix the trends of what consumer behavior is changing. What he can do is invest and really build. And you saw the "South Park" deal they just cut, where they're spending hundreds of millions of dollars to move the show [exclusively] to Paramount+. I think it's a small sign of the post-merger strategy, which is that David Ellison is not just doing this to cut costs and squeeze more juice out of this existing company. His goal is to build something significant with a very long-term perspective, which is going to require a lot of investment. What does that look like? Is the new Paramount just a film studio and a streaming service and CBS — and Ellison sells off everything that's not those things? I think initially they'll say they need the cash flow from cable and will use that cash flow to reinvest. I would be shocked if you didn't see more sports on CBS. I think they will be a contender for UFC rights. You've seen David Ellison multiple times in the past year sitting in the front row, cage side with Ari Emanuel [CEO of TKO Group, which owns UFC], and with [UFC CEO] Dana White. And Donald Trump. I don't disagree there on politics. But I also think he likes the content. I think he's going to spend a lot of money. He understands the tech North Star — whether we're talking about TikTok, Meta, Netflix, or Spotify — it's all about time spent. I think David gets that Paramount+ needs a heck of a lot more time spent. The only way you're gonna get there is a better product and more content. Let's move to Disney. Sometime in the next few weeks, before college football and the NFL starts, ESPN will finally be something you can buy as a stand-alone streaming service. If they rolled this out in 2015, we would have said it's a really big deal. Is it a big deal in 2025? At $30 a month, I don't think this is a huge deal. My guess is it gives them flexibility to start packaging this with other services. They can probably get some subscribers. Not a lot. It's probably low to mid-single-digit millions. Not millions and millions. Remember, they're giving the new service to everybody who already subscribed to [pay TV]. So 65 million-plus ESPN subscribers are going to get this new ESPN app at no additional cost. So who is the audience for this? You're not subscribing to the big bundle. You're a pretty passionate sports fan. You're willing to spend $30 a month for sports. My guess is it's just a small number. It actually makes sense to do it. But I don't think, at the end of the day, it is a huge needle-mover. What's going to matter to Disney stock is their theme park business and their cruise ship business. Those being better than expected — because of the state of the economy and what's happened with tariffs not being as problematic as feared a few months ago — is far more important to Disney than what happens with the ESPN streaming rollout. We're also close to the launch of Fox's own streamer, Fox One. The main assets there are Fox Sports — which is really the NFL — and Fox News. Do you think Fox thinks this is primarily a product for people who want to watch football, or do you think it's primarily for Fox News fans? I think this is a pretty limited offering for a sports fan. So does that lead you to believe that Fox thinks this is really a Fox News product? I think you'll see more uptake from Fox News viewers. In the old days, you would have said that Fox News has a very old audience. And the idea that its audience is going to stream it doesn't make sense. But maybe that's not true in 2025? Streaming's become pretty normalized. When you look at how many subscribers Netflix now has, I don't think streaming is some elitist thing. I think it's pretty normalized. I think the part you may be missing is that the Fox News audience is also widening out. And as you make it available to people on streaming, you may pick up some younger people. Maybe it's more interesting during election years. It creates flexibility. And I don't think there's a whole lot of downside. All the basic cable networks are in freefall. Everyone who owns them is trying to sell them — either directly to another buyer or, in the case of Comcast's Versant, trying to bundle it up as a publicly traded stock. Who is a buyer for cable networks? I don't think there are enough people talking about this topic. So many of the investors I deal with, or even industry executives I talk to, think you're going to see Paramount do a deal with Warner Bros. Or maybe you'll see Versant merge with some of the Paramount cable networks. But let's just step back. I think David Ellison and Larry Ellison have a much bigger plan than aggregating more linear cable networks. I would be surprised if that was the strategy. I think there's a much bigger plan that the Ellison family is probably thinking about that goes well beyond just aggregating more legacy media assets. WarnerMedia merged with Discovery, which hasn't created value. CBS and Viacom became Paramount, and that hasn't created value. Disney bought most of Fox's cable networks, and that hasn't created value. Putting legacy assets together that are in secular decline doesn't work. Maybe it might've been worse [without those deals]. But that's not compelling for a buyer. It's a reason to be a seller. As a buyer, there's lots of things you could buy and lots of places you could go. The idea that buying more of these assets so that you have more costs to cut doesn't seem really compelling. Another reason you are skeptical about big media consolidation is politics. You think that either antitrust politics, or Donald Trump's personal politics, make that unlikely. The only media mogul he wasn't complaining about was Rupert Murdoch, and now he's suing Murdoch. Is there a world where anyone sells or buys a meaningful media asset while Donald Trump is president? I think it's going to be challenging. Jump to

Title: Knock ’em On Their SaaS; Spotify Misses The Spot

Don’t Give Me Your SaaS The software as a service (SaaS) business model has become synonymous with integration and interoperability. One SaaS business usually connects to other SaaS businesses. But not so much anymore, writes Keynes Digital Founder and CEO Dan Larkman at AdMonsters. Wall Street investors and venture capitalists jumped on the SaaS startup bandwagon in a big way. Investors like subscription revenue because it’s seen as more durable and reliable. The Trade Desk, which is not a SaaS company, is at the whims of fickle marketers and agencies. That’s why, when the market sours or things go south for a brand, it’s ad tech and marketing that gets hosed. Unlike a SaaS model, advertisers can easily dial those budgets back. However, Larkman notes, SaaS vendors may have seeded their own destruction. The model worked when the focus was on easy interoperability and the ecosystem. That meant companies had to really earn their SaaS checks. The new focus in SaaS land seems to be around creating switching costs that make it harder to drop a vendor, often by revoking some former interoperability or open data API. Weak Spot Spotify’s stock price dipped 10% on Tuesday after the company missed its earnings expectations for Q2 and dialed back revenue projections for 2025, CNBC reports. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek blamed the shortfall on the company’s late-blooming (or not-so-blooming) advertising business. While streaming media and social platform ads are booming, Spotify’s ad revenue saw only 5% yearly growth (from a relatively smaller base). Advertising lagged far behind Spotify’s overall revenue growth rate of 15%. “The one area that hasn’t yet met our expectations is our ads business,” Ek said. “We’ve simply been moving too slowly, and it’s taken longer than expected to see the improvements we initiated take hold.” Although Spotify has grown its monthly advertiser base by 40% YOY, it still has plenty of headroom in terms of programmatic and direct demand, says Co-President and Chief Business Officer Alex Norström. “With the heavy lifting on our ad tech largely complete, we’re now focused on driving adoption,” Norström says. The plan for driving demand includes more campaign automation and a continued emphasis on video. Spotify’s ad biz is also looking for new leadership. Global head of ad sales Lee Brown is taking on the CRO role at DoorDash, which was announced on Monday. Brown has “done great things for Spotify,” Norström told an investor. “But right now, we need to accelerate the transformation of this business.” We Like Sportz Sports programming is the driving force behind this year’s upfront cycle. On Tuesday, Disney announced that sports ad volume across its linear and addressable businesses will near $4 billion for the 2025-2026 season. Similarly, The Wrap recently reported that Fox earned $2 billion in sports-specific upfront revenue, excluding the World Cup; and although NBCU didn’t disclose specifics, it reportedly saw a 45% year-over-year increase in sports ad volume. Perhaps this might be why sports streamer Fubo, which hasn’t been doing so hot lately, decided to post its preliminary second quarter results in advance of its actual earnings date on August 8. The results, better than expected, come as Fubo’s merger with Disney’s Hulu + Live TV is pending. According to Deadline, the deal is likely to close sooner than anticipated. Even by Q4 this year. Total revenue for Q2 exceeded prior guidance in both North America ($365 million) and the rest of the world ($8 million), and the company is apparently on track to achieve its first quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA. Guess it’s a good time to be in the sports business, huh? (Unless you are an underpaid athlete, of course.) But Wait! There’s More! Yelp is creating its own AI-powered restaurant ads. [The Verge] YouTube is rolling out age “estimation” tech to guess whether or not a user is a teenager.

Title: GraniteShares Announces Reverse Split of CONI

July 29, 2025 17:31 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, July 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a reverse share split for the GraniteShares 2x Short COIN (the “Fund”). The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of the reverse split. After the close of the markets on August 14, 2025 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: Effective after the close of markets on the Payable Date, the Fund’s CUSIP will change as noted in the table below: The reverse share split will apply to shareholders of record as of the close of the NASDAQ Stock Market. (the “NASDAQ”) on August 14, 2025 (the “Record Date”), and payable after the close of the NASDAQ on the Payable Date. Shares of the Funds will begin trading on the NASDAQ on a reverse split-adjusted basis on August 15, 2025 (the “Ex-Date”). On the Ex-Date, the opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the reverse share split. However, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and opening market price on the Ex-Date will be approximately twenty-times higher. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical one-for-twenty reverse split anticipated for the Fund: 1-for-20 Reverse Split The Trust’s transfer agent will notify the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) of the reverse split and instruct DTC to adjust each shareholder’s investment(s) accordingly. DTC is the registered owner of the Fund’s shares and maintains a record of the Fund’s record owners. Redemption of Fractional Shares and Tax Consequences of the Reverse Split As a result of the reverse split, a shareholder of the Fund’s shares potentially could hold a fractional share. However, fractional shares cannot trade on the NASDAQ. Thus, the Fund will redeem for cash a shareholder’s fractional shares at the Fund’s split-adjusted NAV as of the Effective Date. Such redemption may have tax implications for those shareholders and a shareholder could recognize a gain or loss in connection with the redemption of the shareholder’s fractional shares. Otherwise, the reverse split will not result in a taxable transaction for holders of Fund shares. No transaction fee will be imposed on shareholders for such redemption.

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses. This information is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any Funds to any person in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Please consult your tax advisor about the tax consequences of an investment in Fund shares, including the possible application of foreign, state, and local tax laws. You could lose money by investing in the ETFs. There can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Funds will be achieved.

Title: The Making of Dario Amodei
URL: https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/the-making-of-dario-amodei
Time Published: 2025-07-29T18:36:34Z
Full Content:
Dario Amodei doesn’t hesitate when I ask what’s gotten into him. The Anthropic CEO has spent 2025 at war, feuding with industry counterparts, members of the government, and the public’s perception of artificial intelligence. In recent months, he’s predicted that AI could soon eliminate 50% of entry-level, white-collar jobs. He’s railed against a ten-year AI regulation moratorium in the pages of the New York Times. And he’s called for semiconductor export controls to China, drawing a public rebuke from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Amid it all, Amodei meets me on the first floor of his company’s downtown San Francisco headquarters. He’s loose, energetic, and anxious to get started, as if he’s been waiting for this moment to address his actions. Sporting a blue shawl-collar sweater over a casual white t-shirt, and boxy thick-rimmed glasses, he sits down and stares ahead. Underlying his efforts, Amodei says, is a firm belief that AI is moving faster than most of us appreciate, making its opportunities and consequences much closer than they appear. “I am indeed one of the most bullish about AI capabilities improving very fast,” he tells me. “As we've gotten more close to AI systems that are more powerful, I've wanted to say those things more forcefully, more publicly, to make the point clearer.” Amodei’s outspokenness and sharp elbows have earned him both respect and derision in Silicon Valley. He’s seen by some as a technological visionary who pioneered OpenAI’s GPT-3 project (the seeds of ChatGPT) and a safety-minded leader who broke off and founded Anthropic. Others see him as a control-oriented “doomer” who wants to slow AI progress, shape it to his liking, and shut out the competition. Love him or hate him, the AI field will have to deal with him. Amodei has turned Anthropic, currently valued at $61 billion, into an economic force. From a zero start in 2021, the company — though still unprofitable — has grown its annualized recurring revenue from $1.4 billion in March 2025 to $3 billion in May to nearly $4.5 billion in July, leading Amodei to call it the “fastest growing software company in history at the scale that it's at.” Perhaps more notable than Anthropic’s revenue is the way it’s coming in. Rather than relying primarily on applications like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Amodei’s biggest bet is on the underlying technology itself. Most of the company’s revenue, Amodei tells me, is earned via its API, or through other companies buying Anthropic’s AI models and using them within their own products. Anthropic will thus be a barometer of AI’s progress, rising and falling on the strength of the technology. As Anthropic grows, Amodei hopes its heft will help him influence the industry’s direction. And given his willingness to speak out, throw a punch, and take one, he’s probably right. So if this man will steer what may be the world’s most influential new technology, it’s worth understanding what drives him, his business, and why his timeline is shorter than so many others’. And after more than two dozen interviews with him, his friends, colleagues, and competitors, I believe I have an answer. Dario Amodei was a science kid. Born in San Francisco in 1983 to a Jewish mother and an Italian father, he was interested almost entirely in math and physics. When the dot-com boom exploded around him in his high school years, it barely registered. “Writing some website actually had no interest to me whatsoever,” he tells me. “I was interested in discovering fundamental scientific truth.” At home, Amodei was very close with his parents, a loving couple who he says sought to improve the world. His mother Elena Engel ran renovation and construction projects for libraries in Berkeley and San Francisco. His father Riccardo Amodei was a trained leathersmith. “They gave me a sense of right and wrong and what was important in the world,” he says, “imbuing a strong sense of responsibility.” That sense of responsibility showed up in Amodei’s undergrad years at Caltech, where he lambasted his fellow students over their passivity toward the forthcoming Iraq war. “The problem isn't that everyone is just peachy with the idea of bombing Iraq; it's that most people are opposed in principle but refuse to give one millisecond of their time,” Amodei wrote in The California Tech, a student newspaper, on March 3, 2003. “This needs to change, right now and without delay.” Then, in his early 20s, Amodei’s life changed forever. His father Riccardo, who’d long fought a rare illness, lost the battle in 2006. Riccardo’s passing shocked Amodei, and he shifted his graduate studies at Princeton from theoretical physics to biology to address human illness and biological problems. The rest of Amodei’s life has, in some ways, been dedicated to addressing his father’s loss, especially because within four years, a new breakthrough turned the illness from something that was 50% fatal to 95% curable. “There was someone who worked on the cure to this disease, that managed to cure it, and save a bunch of people's lives,” Amodei says, “but could have saved even more.” “I get really angry when someone's like, “This guy's a doomer. He wants to slow things down’” - Dario Amodei Amodei’s father’s passing has shaped his life’s path to this day, says Jade Wang, who dated him in the early 2010s. “It's the difference between his father most likely dying and most likely living, okay?,” she says, explaining that had scientific progress sped up a bit, Amodei’s father might still be with us. It just took a while before he found AI as a vessel to do it. Upon recalling his father’s death, Amodei grows animated. His calls for export controls and AI safeguards, he believes, have been mischaracterized as the actions of someone irrationally seeking to impede AI progress. “I get really angry when someone's like, ‘This guy's a doomer. He wants to slow things down,’” Amodei tells me. “You heard what I just said, my father died because of cures that could have happened a few years [earlier]. I understand the benefit of this technology.” At Princeton, still raw from his father’s loss, Amodei began his quest to decode human biology by studying the retina. Our eyes capture the world by sending signals to the visual cortex — a large part of the brain that takes up 30% of the cerebral cortex — which then processes the data and shows us a picture. If you’re looking to tackle the complexity of the human physiology, the retina is a great place to start. “He used the retina to look at a complete neural population and actually understand what every cell was doing, or at least have that opportunity,” Stephanie Palmer, one of Amodei’s contemporaries at Princeton, tells me. “It was about that more than the eye. He wasn't trying to be an ophthalmologist.” Working in Professor Michael Berry’s retina lab, Amodei was so dissatisfied with the methods available to measure the retina’s signals that he co-invented a new, better sensor to pick up more data. This was atypical for the lab, at once impressive and nonconformist. His dissertation won the Hertz Thesis Prize, a prestigious award granted to those who discover real-world applications in their academic work. But Amodei’s penchant for poking at norms, and his strident sense of the way things should be, set him apart in an academic setting. Berry tells me that Amodei was the most talented graduate student he ever had, but his focus on technological progress and teamwork didn’t play well in a system built to recognize individual achievement. “I think internally, he was kind of a proud person,” Berry tells me. “I imagine his whole academic career up until that point, whenever he did something, people would stand up and clap. And that was not really happening here.” “He wasn't trying to be an ophthalmologist.” - Stephanie Palmer When Amodei left Princeton, the door to AI opened. He began postdoc work under researcher Parag Mallick at Stanford, studying proteins in and around tumors to detect metastatic cancer cells. The work was complex, showing Amodei the limits of what people could do alone, and he started looking for technological solutions. “The complexity of the underlying problems in biology felt like it was beyond human scale,” Amodei tells me. “In order to understand it all, you needed hundreds, thousands of human researchers.” Amodei saw that potential in emerging AI technologies. At the time, an explosion of data and computing power was sparking breakthroughs in machine learning, a subset of AI that long held theoretical potential but had shown middling results until then. After Amodei began experimenting with the technology, he realized it might eventually stand in for those thousands of researchers. “AI, which I was just starting to see the discoveries in, felt to me like the only technology that could kind of bridge that gap,” he says, something that “could bring us beyond human scale.” Amodei left academia to pursue AI advancement in the corporate world, which had the cash to support it. He considered founding a startup, then leaned toward Google, which had a well-funded AI research division in Google Brain and just acquired DeepMind. But Chinese search engine Baidu had handed the esteemed researcher Andrew Ng a $100 million budget to research and deploy AI, and he began to form a superteam. Ng reached out to Amodei, who was intrigued and applied. When Amodei’s application arrived at Baidu, the full team didn't know what to do with it. “He had an impressive background, but his background, from our perspective, was in biology. It was not in machine learning,” Greg Diamos, an early member of the team, tells me. Diamos then looked at Amodei’s code from Stanford, and encouraged the team to hire him. “I was thinking, anyone who can write this has got to be an amazingly good programmer,” he says. Amodei joined Baidu in November 2014. With their vast resources, the Baidu team could throw computing power and data at problems in an attempt to improve their outcomes. They saw remarkable results. In their experiments, Amodei and his colleagues found that AI’s performance improved meaningfully as they added more of these ingredients. The team released a paper on speech recognition that showed that model size directly correlated with performance. “It had a big impact on me, because I saw these very smooth trends,” Amodei says. Amodei’s early work at Baidu contributed to what’s known as the AI “scaling laws,” which are really more of an observation. The scaling laws state that increasing computing power, data, and model size in AI training leads to predictable performance improvements. Scaling everything up, in other words, makes AI better, no novel methods needed. “This was, to me, the most significant discovery I've seen in my life,” Diamos tells me. To this day, Amodei is perhaps the purest believer in the scaling laws among AI research leaders. While peers like Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis and Meta Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun suggest the AI industry needs further breakthroughs to reach human-level artificial intelligence, Amodei speaks with a certainty — though not complete — that the path forward is clear. And as the industry erects massive data centers the size of small cities, he sees exceptionally powerful AI fast approaching. “I see this exponential,” he says. “When you're on an exponential, you can really get fooled by it. Two years away from when the exponential goes totally crazy it looks like it's just starting.” At Baidu, the AI team’s progress became seeds of its undoing. Turf battles broke out within the company over control of its increasingly valuable technology, know-how, and resources. Eventually, meddling from powerbrokers in China sparked a talent exodus and the lab fell apart. Andrew Ng declined to comment. As Baidu’s AI team crumbled, Elon Musk invited Amodei and a number of leading AI researchers to a now-famous dinner at the Rosewood hotel in Menlo Park. Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, and Ilya Sutskever all attended. Seeing AI’s emerging potential, and concerned Google could solidify control over it, Musk decided to fund a new competitor, which became OpenAI. Altman, Brockman, and Sutskever co-founded the new research house with Musk. Amodei thought about joining, felt unsure about the fledgling organization, and went to Google Brain instead. After ten months stuck in large-company morass at Google, Amodei reconsidered. He joined OpenAI in 2016, and got to work on AI safety. He’d grown interested in safety at Google, where he worried about the rapidly improving technology’s capacity for harm and co-authored a paper on its potential for bad behavior. As Amodei settled in at OpenAI, his former Google colleagues introduced the transformer model, the technology behind today’s generative AI moment, in a paper called “Attention is All You Need.” The transformer enabled faster training and much larger models than prior methods. Despite the discovery’s great potential, Google mostly sat on it. OpenAI, meanwhile, got to work. It released its first large language model called “GPT” (the “T” stands for transformer) in 2018. The model generated often-broken text but still demonstrated meaningful improvement over previous language generation methods. Amodei, who’d become a research director at OpenAI, got directly involved in the next iteration, GPT-2, which was effectively the same model as GPT, just bigger. The OpenAI team fine-tuned GPT-2 with a technique called reinforcement learning with human feedback, something Amodei helped pioneer, which helped guide its values. GPT-2 delivered much better results than GPT, as expected, showing an ability to paraphrase, write, and answer questions somewhat coherently. Language models soon became the focal point at OpenAI. As Amodei’s profile increased within OpenAI, so did the controversy around him. A prolific writer, he’d produce long documents about values and technology, which some colleagues saw as inspirational but others saw as flag planting and heavy handed. (One such memo: an exploration of “M” companies vs. “P” companies, where Ms provide market-focused goods and Ps provide public-focused goods). Amodei, to some, was also too focused on maintaining secrecy around the technology’s potential and collaborating with the government to address it. And he could be a bit abrasive, sometimes disparaging projects he didn’t believe in. OpenAI still entrusted Amodei with the leadership of the GPT-3 project, handing him 50-60% of the entire company’s compute to build a massively scaled up version of its language model. The jump from GPT to GPT-2 was large, a ten-fold increase. But the jump from GPT-2 to GPT-3 would be massive, a 100x project costing tens of millions of dollars. The results were stunning. The New York Times quoted independent researchers surprised by the GPT-3’s ability to code, summarize, and translate. Amodei, who was relatively restrained upon the release of GPT-2, gushed about his new model. “It has this emergent quality,” he told the Times. “It has some ability to recognize the pattern that you gave it and complete the story.” But cracks beneath the surface at OpenAI began to tear wide open. With the creation of GPT-3, the first capable language model, the stakes for Amodei increased. After seeing the scaling laws work in multiple disciplines at this point, Amodei considered where the technology was headed and developed an even greater interest in safety. “He looked at this technology and assumed it would work,” Jack Clark, a close colleague of Amodei’s at OpenAI, tells me. “And if you assume it works, in the sense that it's going to be as smart as a person, you can't help but be concerned of the safety things in some sense.” Though Amodei led OpenAI’s model development, and directed a good chunk of its compute, parts of the company were out of his hands. This included deciding when to release models, personnel matters, how the company deploys its technology, and how it represents itself externally. “Many of those things,” Amodei says, “are not things that you control just by training the models.” Amodei, by then, had formed a tight-knit group of coworkers around him — which some called “the pandas,” due to his love of the animal — and had very different ideas from OpenAI leadership about how to handle these functions. Infighting ensued, and the factions developed an intense dislike for each other. “He believes that AI is so scary that only they should do it” - Jensen Huang In our conversation, Amodei didn’t mask his feelings. “The leaders of a company, they have to be trustworthy people,” he says. “They have to be people whose motivations are sincere, no matter how much you're driving forward the company technically. If you're working for someone whose motivations are not sincere, who's not an honest person, who does not truly want to make the world better, it's not going to work. You're just contributing to something bad.” Within OpenAI, some saw Amodei’s focus on safety as a route to control the company altogether. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently echoed these criticisms after Amodei called for GPU export controls to China. “He believes that AI is so scary that only they should do it,” Huang said. “That's the most outrageous lie I've ever heard,” Amodei tells me of Huang’s claim, adding he’s always wanted to spark a ‘race to the top’ by encouraging others to emulate Anthropic’s safety practices. “I’ve said nothing that anywhere near resembles the idea that this company should be the only one to build the technology. I don't know how anyone could ever derive that from anything that I've said. It’s just an incredible and bad faith distortion.” My full conversation with Amodei will be live on Big Technology Podcast tomorrow. You can subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or your app of choice. Nvidia, which just won a rollback of some of Amodei’s favored export controls, doubled down. "We support safe, responsible, and transparent AI. Thousands of startups and developers in our ecosystem and the open-source community are enhancing safety,” an Nvidia spokesperson tells me. “Lobbying for regulatory capture against open source will only stifle innovation, make AI less safe and secure, and less democratic. That's not a 'race to the top' or the way for America to win." OpenAI hit back as well, via a company spokesperson. “We’ve always believed that AI should benefit and empower everyone, not just those who say it’s too risky for anyone but themselves to develop safely,” the spokesperson says. “As the technology has evolved, our decisions on partnerships, model releases, and funding have become standard across the industry, including at Anthropic. What hasn’t changed is our focus on making AI safe, useful, and available to as many people as possible.” Over time, the differences between Amodei’s group and OpenAI’s leaders became so untenable that something had to give. “Fifty percent of our time was spent trying to convince other people of views that we held, and fifty percent was spent working,” Clark says. So in December 2020, Amodei, Clark, Amodei’s sister Daniela, researcher Chris Olah, and a handful of others departed OpenAI to start something new. In a conference room within Anthropic offices, Clark turns around his laptop and displays one of Anthropic’s earliest documents. It’s a list of names including Aligned AI, Generative, Sponge, Swan, Sloth, and Sparrow Systems. Anthropic, a word that connotes being human centered and human oriented, is also there, and it also happened to be an available domain name in early 2021. “We like the name it is good,” the team wrote in the spreadsheet. And thus, Anthropic was born. Anthropic was formed in the heart of Covid, meeting entirely on Zoom amid the pandemic’s second wave. Eventually, its 15 to 20 employees would meet for weekly lunches in San Francisco’s Precita Park, pulling up their own chairs to talk business. The company’s early mission was simple: Build leading large language models, implement safe practices to pressure others to follow, and publish what it learned, apart from its models’ core technical details. It might sound odd that the group of less than two dozen people meeting in a park with their own chairs would feel a sense of destiny, especially since they’d need billions of dollars to see their mission through, but that was the vibe in Anthropic’s early days. “The strangest thing about all of this is how inevitable so much of it felt to people on the inside,” Clark says. “We've done scaling laws. We could see the path to the models getting good.” Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt was among Anthropic’s first investors. He’d met Amodei through his then-girlfriend and now wife, who Schmidt knew socially. The two talked technology when Amodei was still at OpenAI, and business when he started Anthropic. Schmidt tells me he invested in the person more than the concept. “At this level, when you're doing an investment like that, you have essentially no data, right?” he says. “You don't know what the revenue is. You don't know the market. You don't know what the product is. And so you fundamentally have to decide based on the people. And Dario is a brilliant scientist, and he promised to hire brilliant scientists, which he did. He promised to lead a very small company doing it, which he did not. Now it's a very large company, and now it's a normal company. I figured it would be a very interesting research lab.” This story took months to report — made possible by our subscribers.

Now-disgraced FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was also among Anthropic’s early investors, directing a reported $500 million from FTX’s coffers for a 13.56% stake in the company. Bankman-Fried was one of a number of effective altruists who invested in Anthropic’s early stages, when the movement and company were close. Amodei says SBF was an AI bull interested in safety, a good fit, but had sufficient red flags to keep him off the board and give him non-voting shares. SBF’s behavior, Amodei says, “turned out to be much, much, much more extreme and bad than I ever imagined.” Amodei’s pitch to prospective investors was simple: He told them Anthropic had the talent to build cutting-edge models at a tenth of the cost. And it worked. To date, Amodei’s brought in nearly $20 billion, including $8 billion from Amazon and $3 billion from Google. “Investors aren't idiots,” he tells me. “They basically understand the concept of capital efficiency.” In Anthropic’s second year, OpenAI introduced generative AI to the world with ChatGPT, but Anthropic took a different path. Rather than focus on consumer applications, Amodei decided Anthropic would sell its technology to businesses. There were two benefits to this strategy. If the models were useful it could be lucrative, and the challenge would prod the company into building better technology. Improving an AI model from undergrad to graduate level in biochemistry might not excite the common chatbot user, Amodei says, but it would be valuable to a pharmaceutical company like Pfizer. “It gives a better incentive to develop the models as far as possible,” he says. Oddly enough, it was an Anthropic consumer product that got businesses to pay attention to its technology. The company released its Claude chatbot in July 2023, nearly a year after ChatGPT’s debut, and it drew rave reviews due to its high-EQ personality (an outgrowth of Anthropic’s safety work). The company, until then, had sought to remain under 150 employees, but soon found itself hiring more people in a day than it employed in total in its entire first year. “It was that Claude chatbot moment when the company started to grow a lot,” Clark says. Amodei’s bet on building AI for business use cases attracted loads of eager customers. Anthropic’s now sold its large language models across multiple industries — travel, healthcare, financial services, insurance, and more — including to leaders like Pfizer, United Airlines, and AIG. The Ozempic-maker Novo Nordisk is, for instance, using Anthropic to condense a fifteen-day regulatory report compilation process into ten minutes. “The technology we've built ends up taking care of a lot of the stuff that people complain the most about their work,” Kate Jensen, Anthropic’s head of revenue, tells me. Coders, meanwhile, have fallen in love with Anthropic. The company focused on AI code generation both because it could help speed its model development and because coders would adopt it quickly if it worked well enough. Sure enough, the use cases exploded and have coincided with — or caused — the rise of AI coding tools like Cursor. Anthropic is also getting into the coding application business itself. It released Claude Code, an AI coding tool, in February 2025. As AI usage booms, the company’s revenue is as well. “Anthropic’s revenue every year has grown 10x,” Amodei says. “We went from zero to $100 million in 2023. We went from $100 million to a billion in 2024. And this year, in this first half of the year, we've gone from $1 billion to I think, as of speaking today, it’s well above $4 [billion], it might be $4.5 [billion].” The last figure is annualized, or 12x the month’s revenue. Anthropic’s 8 and 9 figure deals have tripled in 2025 vs. 2024, the company says, and its business customers have spent 5x more on average. But Anthropic is spending a lot of money to train and run its models, raising questions about whether its business model is sustainable. The company is deeply unprofitable, expected to lose about $3 billion this year. And its gross margins have also reportedly lagged behind typical cloud software companies. Some of Anthropic’s customers are wondering if the company’s attempt to sort out its business is showing up in the product. One startup founder told me that while Anthropic is the best model for his use case, he can’t rely on it because it’s down too often. Amjad Masad, CEO of vibe coding company Replit, told me the cost to use its models has stopped coming down after a period of price decreases. Claude Code also just added additional rate limits after some developers used it so much it became bad business. Entrepreneur and developer Kieran Klaassen tells me that he got $6,000 worth of Claude API usage in one month for just the $200 Max subscription price. Klaassen says he’s run multiple Claude agents at a time. “The real limit comes in your mental capacity to switch from one to the other,” he says. Amodei says that as Anthropic’s models improve, customers will get a better deal if costs stay the same, effectively buying more intelligence per dollar. He also says that AI labs are just beginning to optimize for inference, or the act of using the models, which should lead to efficiency improvements. This is a place to pay attention. Multiple industry sources told me inference costs must drop for the business to make sense. Anthropic’s executives, in their interviews with me, suggest there are worse problems than high demand for your product. The open question is whether generative AI, and the scaling laws that propel it, will neatly follow other technology’s cost reduction curves, or whether it’s a novel technology with a novel cost. The only sure thing is it’ll take a lot more money to find out. At the beginning of 2025, Anthropic needed cash. The AI industry’s hunger for scale had catalyzed massive data center buildouts and compute deals. To support these undertakings, AI labs had repeatedly smashed startup fundraising records. And established companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon used their sizable profits and data centers to build their own models, turning up the pressure. Anthropic has a special imperative to build large. Without a powerhouse application like ChatGPT, where users come back out of habit, its models must lead in their use cases or risk being swapped out for a competitor. “In the corporate space, and especially in coding, there’s very clearly an advantage to be six months or a year ahead of the state of the art,” Box CEO Aaron Levie, an Anthropic customer, tells me. So the company turned to Ravi Mhatre, a veteran venture capitalist and partner at Lightspeed Ventures, to lead a $3.5 billion funding round. Mhatre used to write $5 or $10-million checks, but the one he was readying to cut would be among his firm’s largest. “Amazon went public with a $400 million market cap,” he tells me. “$400 million! Think about that today.” The fundraise was proceeding as planned when a cheap, competing AI model dropped seemingly out of thin air. The Chinese hedge fund High Flyer released DeepSeek R1, an open-source, capable, and efficient reasoning model that it priced forty times lower than its peers. DeepSeek shocked the business world and had multi-trillion-dollar CEOs tweeting Wikipedia articles to calm shareholders. By the time DeepSeek arrived, Mhatre had completed a full projection of why the AI models themselves, not the chatbots of the world, would generate the most value. He concluded that creating artificial intelligence capable of knowledge work would allow companies to have revenue ten times what the large cloud platforms bring in, leading to a total potential market of $15 to 20 trillion. “So then you work backwards and just say, at $60 billion or $100 billion, could you get a venture-style return? You absolutely could,” he says. “Sometimes it's about how you size the markets top-down.” DeepSeek’s arrival suggested that open source, efficient, almost-as-good models could challenge the incumbents, but Amodei didn’t see it that way. His greatest concern, he says, is whether any new model is better than Anthropic’s. If you can download the model’s designs, you still need to set it up on a cloud service and run it, he says, which takes skill and money. Amodei delivered a version of this argument to Mhatre and his colleagues at Lightspeed as the DeepSeek story took off, convincing them that some of the model’s innovations could be improved with scale. That Monday, Nvidia stock dropped 17% as panicked investors fled the AI infrastructure trade. Amid the uncertainty, the VC made a decision. “I'm not going to tell you that it wasn't extraordinarily stressful,” Mhatre says. “That Monday, we wired $1 billion.” Six months after DeepSeek Monday, Anthropic is looking to scale up yet again. The company is in talks for a new funding round that could reach $5 billion which would double its valuation to $150 billion. The potential investors include some middle eastern Gulf states that Anthropic once seemed eager to steer clear of. But after raising nearly $20 billion from Google, Amazon, and VCs like Lightspeed, it’s running out of options for bigger checks. “I'm not going to tell you that it wasn't extraordinarily stressful. That Monday, we wired $1 billion.” - Ravi Mhatre Within Anthropic, Amodei has argued the Gulf states have $100 billion or more in capital to invest, and their cash would help Anthropic stay on the technology’s frontier. He seemed to reluctantly accept the idea of taking the money from dictators in an internal Slack message obtained by Wired. “Unfortunately,” he wrote. “I think ‘No bad person should ever benefit from our success’ is a pretty difficult principle to run a business on.” Speaking with Amodei makes me wonder how, or if, this race to improve AI will end. I imagine the models might eventually get so big, and so good, they commoditize. Or perhaps, as Amodei’s former colleague Ilya Sutskever once suggested, the endless drive to scale ends up covering the planet with solar panels and datacenters. There’s also another possibility, one AI believers don’t like to discuss: AI improvement plateaus, leading to a historic investor wipeout. At Anthropic’s first developer conference in May, I grab a seat a few rows from the stage and await Amodei’s appearance. The company’s packed The Midway — an airy arts and events venue in San Francisco’s Dogpatch neighborhood — with coders, press, and many of its now 1,000+ employees. There’s broad anticipation inside that Anthropic will release Claude 4, its latest, biggest model. Amodei takes the stage and introduces Claude 4. Instead of a flashy presentation, he picks up a handheld mic, makes the announcement, reads his notes from a laptop, and then turns the spotlight over to Anthropic product head Mike Krieger. The crowd seems into it. Amodei’s promise of what’s coming next, to me, is more notable than the model update itself. Throughout the day, he repeatedly mentions that AI development is speeding up, and that Anthropic’s next model releases will come faster. “I don't know exactly how much more frequent,” he says. “But the pace is increasing,” Anthropic, as Amodei’s told me, has been developing AI coding tools to speed up its model development. When I bring this up to Jared Kaplan, the company’s co-founder and chief scientist, he tells me it’s working. “Most engineers at Anthropic use AI to help them be more productive,” he says. “So it's definitely speeding us up quite a bit.” There’s a concept in AI theory called an intelligence explosion, where the model is able to make itself better and then — fffffoooooom — self-improves and become all mighty. Kaplan doesn’t dismiss the notion that an intelligence explosion might arrive via this method, or perhaps a human-assisted version. “It could be two or three years away. Could take longer. Could take much longer,” Kaplan says. “But when I say there’s a 50% chance of AI being able to do all the things that knowledge workers do, one of the things we do is train AI models.” “Maybe people like me won't really have much to do,” Kaplan continues. “It's more complicated than that. But we are quite likely headed towards the future that looks like that.” Amodei’s safety obsession, at this point, comes into clear focus. While nobody within Anthropic says an intelligence explosion is imminent, it’s evident they’re not shying away from moving toward it. If AI is going to get better, faster — and perhaps much faster — it’s worth being careful about its downsides. Some of this theoretical talk clearly helps Anthropic market its services to pharmaceutical companies and developers, but AI models are now coding well enough that it no longer feels completely insane. Jan Leike, the former head of OpenAI’s ‘Superalignment’ team, followed Amodei to Anthropic in 2024 to co-lead its alignment science team. Alignment is the art of tuning AI systems to ensure they are aligned with our values and goals. And Leike believes syncing the machines with our intentions will be crucial should we see the anticipated eruption. “There could be a period of rapid capability progress,” Leike tells me. “You don't want to lose control or lose scalability over a system that's recursively self-improving.” Already, Anthropic and its counterparts have found AI sometimes demonstrates a worrying interest in self-preservation while testing in simulation environments. In Claude 4’s documentation, for instance, Anthropic stated the model repeatedly attempted to blackmail an engineer to avoid being shut down. “You don't want to lose control or lose scalability over a system that's recursively self-improving.” - Jan Leike Anthropic’s also said its AI has worked to deceive evaluators when it thought they might rewrite its values. The model also attempted to copy itself out of Anthropic’s infrastructure in a simulation. Leike says Anthropic is working to discourage these behaviors via reward systems. The field is still experimental. Speaking openly about these issues is part of Amodei’s “race to the top” strategy. Anthropic’s also funded — and advocated for — interpretability, or the science of understanding what takes place within AI models. And it’s published a Responsible Scaling Policy, a framework that sets boundaries for when to release and train models depending on their risks, which has inspired similar efforts among its peers. “The way I think about the race to the top is that it doesn't matter who wins,” Amodei says. “Everyone wins, right?” Amodei’s dedication to AI, forged in the tragedy of his father’s loss, may now have its goal in sight. Today’s AI is already speeding up drug development paperwork, it’s become an (imperfect) medical advisor in a broken medical system, and, if things go right, it may one day stand in for those hundreds or thousands of researchers needed to understand human biology. Could Amodei’s pursuit of this vision, I ask, blind him to the risks of losing control of the technology? “That's not the way I think about it,” he says. “We've gotten better at controlling models with every model that we release. All these things go wrong, but you really have to stress test the models pretty hard.” Amodei sees this line of questioning as rooted in the slow-it-down doomerism he’s often accused of. His plan, contrary to the critics, is to accelerate. “The reason I'm warning about the risk is so that we don't have to slow down,” he says. “I have such an incredible understanding of the stakes.

Meta's strong earnings sent its stock soaring after hours as CEO Mark Zuckerberg detailed the company's all-in approach to the AI race. The company also made it clear that competing in the AI talent war comes with a hefty price tag. Meta's second-quarter results handily beat analysts' estimates for revenue and earnings per share. Revenue was $47.52 billion, compared to expectations of $44.83 billion. Earnings per share were $7.14, compared to estimates of $5.89. Meta shares were up over 12% in after-hours trading during the analyst call, hitting $780, which would represent an all-time high for the stock. In a reference to Meta's recent AI hiring spree, the company cited employee compensation for "technical talent in priority areas" as its second-largest driver in cost growth, behind infrastructure expenses. Zuckerberg took a bit of a victory lap after the launch of his new Superintelligence Lab, which is run by Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang — a hiring made possible by Meta's eye-watering $15 billion investment in the startup. "We're building an elite, talent-dense team," he said. "I've spent a lot of time building this team this quarter." He referenced the hiring of ex-OpenAI researcher Shengjia Zhao, now chief scientist of Meta's Superintelligence Labs, and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. The Meta CEO is clearly bullish on the idea of leaner AI divisions, praising "the ability for small talent, dense teams to be the optimal configuration for driving frontier research." The company also gave updates on its hit AI Ray-Bans, sales of which are "accelerating" and helped drive a revenue increase of nearly 5% for the Reality Labs division. Zuckerberg said that glasses will be "the ideal form factor for AI," echoing his vision he outlined in a letter earlier in the day about "personal superintelligence." On the advertising front, Meta CFO Susan Li said that nearly 2 million advertisers have used the company's AI video generation and image tools. Scroll on for the highlights from Meta's analyst call: Analysts are pleased with Meta's results. William Blair analysts titled their post-earnings note "Massive Quarter Fueled by AI Advancements" and shared key reasons for their optimism. "The company is demonstrating that it can profitably scale the business while making massive capital investments," they wrote. "We continue to be positive on its AI adoption and benefits to advertisers and believe Meta will be a long-term AI leader. RBC analysts called Meta's performance a "Strong Q2" and highlighted how the company delivered 22% revenue growth at the "high-end of guidance and expectations." And Wedbush's tech analyst Dan Ives, a perennial tech bull, expressed his approval in a post on X. "We have been talking about the AI Revolution for years but tonight was a night the tech world and the Street will remember for a long time," he wrote. "The jaw dropping numbers from Redmond and Meta speaks to the AI Revolution hitting its next stage of hyper growth," he added, referring to Microsoft and Meta results. "I think in the future, if you don't have glasses that have AI or some way to interact with AI, I think you'd probably be at a pretty significant cognitive disadvantage compared to other people," Zuckerberg says. Glasses will be the "ideal way to blend the physical and digital worlds together," he predicts, mentioning the metaverse. (Note: This appears to be the only mention of the "metaverse" in the earnings call; many people will remember when the metaverse was a big buzzword in Meta's earnings. Looks like that's "superintelligence" now.) Meta's stock is trading up 12% to $778 after hours, a record level for the company. Zuckerberg talks about the smaller size of Meta's new Superintelligence Labs team. It's an echo of what he's said about building lean teams focused on efficiency. He praises "the ability for small talent, dense teams to be the optimal configuration for driving frontier research." It breaks from how the company operates in other divisions, he notes. "If you look at like what we do in Instagram or Facebook or our ad system, we can very productively have many hundreds or 1000s of people basically working on improving those systems," he says. "But I think for this, for the leading research on superintelligence, you really want the smallest group that can hold the whole thing in their head." Zuckerberg says he doesn't believe his thinking on open-source has particularly changed. Zuckerberg expects to continue to ship open-source products, though there are some challenging considerations with open-sourcing at this scale, he says. "We're getting models that are so big that they're just not practical for a lot of other people to use. So we kind of wrestle with whether it's productive or helpful to share that, or if that's really just primarily helping competitors or something like that," he says. The bottom line, Zuckerberg says, is he expects to continue to ship open-source products, but not every product will be — which he says is a continuation of Meta's approach to open-source. "There's just a very high chance it seems like the world is going to look pretty different in a few years from now," Zuckerberg notes. "The more aggressive assumptions, or the fastest assumptions, have been the ones that have most accurately predicted what would happen." The stock price hits $771 as questions with Wall Street analysts begin. Li says the company continues to focus on head count growth in its "highest priority areas." "We've had a particular emphasis on recruiting leading talent within the industry as we build out Meta Superintelligence Labs to accelerate our AI model development and product initiatives," she says. Turning to AI-related infrastructure costs, Meta also expects to "ramp our investments significantly in 2026" for infrastructure. "Nearly 2 million advertisers are now using our video generation features, image animation, and video expansion, and we're seeing strong results with our text generation tools as we continue to add new features," CFO Susan Li says. In the second quarter, the company started testing AI-powered translations to 10 different languages, she adds. Meta says Reality Labs revenue, its segment that includes its AI hardware as well as virtual and augmented reality headsets, is up nearly 5% — thanks to sales of its AI Ray-Bans. Zuckerberg says that he thinks AI glasses will be "the main way" that the company integrates personal superintelligence into people's daily lives. The Meta CEO says the company has built an "elite" team of AI researchers and engineers, highlighting the hire of Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang, who leads the new lab. "We're building an elite, talent-dense team," he said. "I've spent a lot of time building this team this quarter." He also referenced the hiring of ex-OpenAI researcher Shengjia Zhao, chief scientist of Meta's Superintelligence Labs and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. The company has noted in its earnings release that employee compensation for adding technical talent in "priority areas" (read AI) is its second-greatest driver of cost growth. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is on the call, along with CFO Susan Li. "Meta's blowout earnings and raised guidance highlight how AI is becoming a real revenue driver, not just hype," said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com. "From ad targeting to content discovery, Meta is showing how to deploy AI at scale — and Wall Street is rewarding it. The company's continued heavy investment in AI infrastructure signals it's playing the long game and betting big on foundational models and compute power." Minda Smiley, senior analyst at EMARKETER, a sister company of Business Insider, said the company's strong quarter shows it "not only weathered but perhaps even benefitted from economic instability in recent months" and that the digital ads market more broadly "might not yet feel the pain from tariffs, though that could change." And while Meta continues pouring money into its AI ambitions, "Meta's exorbitant spending on its AI visions will continue to draw questions and scrutiny from investors who are eager to see returns," Smiley said. The company revised its ranges on total expenses and capital expenditures it forecasts for 2025, narrowing its estimates. Its total expense outlook, previously $113 to $118 billion, is now $114 to $118 billion for the year. (That's growth of 20 to 24% year-over-year.) Meta also narrowed its capex range, from $64 to $72 billion previously to $66 to $72 billion for the year. It says it also expects "another year of similarly significant capital expenditures dollar growth in 2026." Those AI talent wars you've been reading about? They're real — and expensive — Meta says. Not in those words, exactly. But that's clearly what the company is getting at in today's note to investors, where it acknowledged that all that spending is indeed going to show up on its financial statements. "While we are still very early in planning for next year, there are a few factors we expect will provide meaningful upward pressure on our 2026 total expense growth rate," Meta said. "The largest single driver of growth will be infrastructure costs, driven by a sharp acceleration in depreciation expense growth and higher operating costs as we continue to scale up our infrastructure fleet." "Aside from infrastructure, we expect the second largest driver of growth to be employee compensation as we add technical talent in priority areas," Meta added. That said, Meta says its overall organization got smaller in the last quarter. It currently employs 75,945 people, down about 1% from the 76,834 it reported in Q1. —Peter Kafka Second quarter Advertising rev. $46.56 billion, +21% y/y, estimate $44.07 billion Family of Apps revenue $47.15 billion, +22% y/y, estimate $44.4 billion Reality Labs revenue $370 million, +4.8% y/y, estimate $386 million Other revenue $583 million, +50% y/y, estimate $500.6 million Operating income $20.44 billion, +38% y/y, estimate $17.24 billion Family of Apps operating income $24.97 billion, +29% y/y, estimate $22.16 billion Reality Labs operating loss $4.53 billion, +0.9% y/y, estimate loss $4.86 billion Average price per ad +9% vs. +10% y/y, estimate +7.58% Source: Bloomberg data Meta's hardware sales could be key to watch in light of some new developments since the company's last earnings call. In June, Zuckerberg unveiled new Oakley Meta glasses, similar to Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses but branded as "performance AI glasses" geared toward athletes. Earlier this week, EssilorLuxottica, which makes Ray-Ban and Oakley, said revenue from sales of Meta's Ray-Bans more than tripled year-over-year. Wall Street was impressed with Meta's demo of its Orion augmented reality glasses prototype in September, though the glasses aren't expected to launch to consumers before 2027. Any update on the expected timeline for the more advanced AI smart glasses, which included integrated displays in the lenses, would be of interest to investors. Meta stock edged 0.6% lower Wednesday afternoon as investors prepared to parse the company's quarterly results. Shares of the tech giant are up 19% year-to-date. You can expect AI to be a heavy focus on this earnings call. (What else is new?) The company is allocating billions in capital expenditures toward infrastructure, talent, and other costs to support its AI ambitions. Meta has been in an all-out talent war for the biggest names in AI, poaching some competitors from rival firms with million-dollar bonuses. The company in June announced a new AI division called Superintelligence Labs. The company took a 49% stake in Scale AI for nearly $15 billion to make Scale founder Alexandr Wang Meta's new chief AI officer. — Sarah Jackson Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, wrote this month that investors will likely be most interested in three things heading into Meta's earnings call: Still, Zino said he expects Meta to meet its expected revenue targets for the second and third quarters, largely due to increased stability in the digital ad market. CFRA reiterated its "Buy" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $800 from $750, implying 12% upside from current levels. Zuckerberg kicked off the company's earnings day by sharing his vision on superintelligence, which he believes is "now in sight." His memo Wednesday outlined his hope for a future where everyone has "a personal superintelligence that helps you achieve your goals." "Personal superintelligence that knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them will be by far the most useful," he wrote. "Personal devices like glasses that understand our context because they can see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day will become our primary computing devices." (Of course, it's worth noting that Meta sells various smart glasses.) — Sarah Jackson Meta could lift its capital expenditures even higher as it ploughs more money into AI and superintelligence projects, analysts at Citizens wrote. "With Meta making material investments in its superintelligence team, including researchers and compute, we believe the company is going through a significant investment cycle and we expect 2026 CapEx to surprise the Street as Meta builds multiple 1GQ or greater data centers," they said, estimating capex could come in around $91 billion next year. Stocks typically don't benefit when a company is going through an investment cycle, analysts said, but the situation could be different for Meta, as AI can enhance the ad experience for users. The firm reiterated its "Market Outperform" rating and $750 price target on the stock, implying 5% upside from current levels. Needham had a mixed view of Meta headed into its second-quarter earnings. On the one hand, the firm's analysts upgraded their rating for the stock from "Underperform" to "Hold," citing two positive catalysts: Still, the firm sees a few risks ahead that held it back from rating the stock a "buy." Those include pressure on Meta's margins and free-cash flow, potentially higher-than-expected total labor costs due to stock-based compensation, and Meta's use of several strategies in its business, which "wastes capital and adds risks," analysts said. Oppenheimer said it sees a handful of risks looming for Meta stock. Oppenheimer reiterated its "Outperform" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $775 a share, implying 9% upside from current levels. Bank of America called Meta a "Top Online ad stock" for 2025 in a note this month. That's because the company looks best-positioned to reap the benefits from AI-driven advertising, analysts wrote, which they believe could support a higher valuation for the stock. In a separate note, analysts said they expected Meta to beat consensus estimates for second-quarter earnings, pointing to positive checks the bank conducted on Meta's advertising business. Revenue could come in around $45.5 billion, they estimated, at the higher end of Meta's guidance for the quarter. The bank reiterated its "Buy" rating on Meta. Earlier this month, it lifted its price target for the stock to $775 from $765, which implies 9% upside from current levels. Second Quarter Third Quarter Full year Source: Bloomberg data Jump to

Title: 6 Top Nuclear Power Stocks And ETFs To Buy And Power Your Portfolio Growth

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. As power hungry AI cloud services providers seek ever more energy, nuclear energy is enjoying a revival. While younger people who did not live through the near-meltdowns such as Chernobyl (1986) and Three Mile Island (1979) are bullish, the regulatory and financial barriers to building nuclear power plants remain formidable. Nevertheless, capital providers see these barriers as worth hurdling. With annual investment in nuclear power doubling to $60 billion since 2020, nuclear power could energize your portfolio. For example, Microsoft signed a 20-year agreement to use power from Three Mile Island, and Meta signed a similar deal with another nuclear power facility. To profit from this trend while considering the risks, read on for three publicly-traded stocks and three exchange traded funds which could rise along with demand for nuclear energy. With concerns about energy security and climate change on the rise, nuclear power is experiencing a resurgence. Roughly 400 reactors are now operating in 31 countries providing about 5% of the world’s electricity. What’s more, new nuclear reactors are being constructed. Of the 63 nuclear reactors being built, many deploy new technologies such as Small Modular Reactors – which are safer and smaller – and advanced Generation IV reactors, wrote Goldman Sachs. Another positive is the support for nuclear power from younger people who lack a direct memory of previous disasters and recognize nuclear’s “role in decarbonization efforts,” reports Strats Research. Nevertheless, nuclear faces significant challenges, including the following: Baltimore, Maryland-based Constellation Energy Corporation produces and sells electricity, natural gas, energy-related products and sustainable solutions in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York, ERCOT and other power regions. Constellation is a top choice because it is the largest operator of nuclear reactors in the United States and a major provider of carbon-free electricity. The company's focus on nuclear power provides a reliable source of baseload electricity and makes it an attractive partner for technology companies needing consistent power for data centers. For instance, Meta recently announced a 20-year nuclear agreement with Constellation. Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based Cameco Corporation provides uranium through three segments: Uranium, Fuel Services and Westinghouse. The Uranium segment explores for, mines, mills, purchases and sells uranium concentrate. The Fuel Services segment refines, converts, and fabricates uranium concentrate. The Westinghouse segment makes nuclear reactor technology equipment and provides products and services to commercial utilities and government agencies, reported Yahoo! Finance. As one of the world's largest uranium producers, Cameco is a top choice because it is likely to benefit from increasing nuclear fuel demand. The company has substantial high-grade uranium reserves and long-term contracts with utility companies, providing a degree of stability. Cameco also has an ownership stake in Westinghouse Electric, providing exposure to nuclear reactor construction, according to SeekingAlpha. Corvallis, Oregon-based NuScale Power provides a small modular reactor technology system -- the NuScale Power Module. The NPM, a water reactor, can generate 77 megawatts of electricity. Founded in 2007, NuScale operates as a subsidiary of Fluor Enterprises, according to Yahoo! Finance. NuScale is a top choice due to the company’s leadership in SMR technology, which offers potential benefits in scalability, safety, and faster deployment compared to traditional large reactors. The company’s SMR design is the first to be certified by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, giving it a potential first-mover advantage in this emerging technology, according to 24/7 Wall Street. One year price change: 48.7% Top five holdings: The VanEck Uranium and Nuclear ETF The fund normally invests at least 80% of its total assets in securities that comprise the fund's benchmark index of equity securities and depositary receipts issued by uranium and nuclear energy companies, according to Yahoo! Finance. The ETF is a top choice because it offers broader exposure to the nuclear energy sector beyond just uranium miners. It includes uranium miners, nuclear power plant builders and maintainers, nuclear electricity producers, and related equipment and technology. The fund's exposure to utilities can make a portfolio more defensive. One year price change: 50% Top five holdings: Range Nuclear Renaissance Index ETF normally invests in securities of nuclear fuel and energy – particularly in the areas of advanced reactors; utilities; construction and services; and/or fuel. Under normal circumstances, the fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in securities of nuclear companies. The ETF is a top choice because it tracks a custom index reflecting the nuclear industry broadly. It offers significant exposure to advanced reactor technology, including a large position in Oklo, which makes small modular reactors. NUKZ has shown strong performance and offers exposure to the developing advanced nuclear technology sector, according to TipRanks. One year price change: 54.6% Top five holdings: Global X Uranium ETF normally invests at least 80% of its total assets in the securities of the underlying index that tracks the broad based equity market performance of global companies involved in the uranium industry, according to Yahoo! Finance. URA is a top choice because it is the largest and most popular nuclear ETF by assets under management. It provides broad exposure to the uranium and nuclear energy value chain, including uranium producers, nuclear component manufacturers and service providers. This ETF also offers direct exposure to the physical uranium commodity, which is unique among nuclear ETFs. Bottom Line With investment in nuclear power doubling over the last five years, should you invest in companies and ETFs that track its growth? Despite the risks of nuclear power – which include enormous capital requirements, regulatory and political hurdles and the risk of nuclear accidents – the stocks and ETFs highlighted above may offer upside opportunity. As long as large AI cloud services providers are eager to buy nuclear energy, these investments could enrich your portfolio

Title: Ethereum: BitMine’s Bold $60K ETH Call Fails To Offset Stock Slide

Ethereum is on the spotlight as BitMine Immersion Technologies stock took a sharp hit on Monday, falling over 25% despite a fresh round of bullish messaging from Tom Lee of FundStrat. Investors seemed unconvinced by the plan to make BitMine a major holder and staker of Ethereum. The dip came after shares slid over 10% during regular hours to $35, then dropped another 15% in after‑hours trading. According to FundStrat’s Tom Lee, BitMine plans to hold 5% of Ethereum’s total supply and become a “made in America validator network.” He highlighted that BitMine already has 600,000 ETH on its balance sheet—worth more than $2 billion at current prices. Lee even floated the idea that Ether could reach an implied valuation of $60,000, citing unnamed research firms. But those bold figures failed to calm the market. 10/18 We asked several research firms to give us “replacement” value (of Wall Street) to value ETH – this is for illustrative purposes only – implied value for ETH is $60,000 – ETH currently ~$3,800 pic.twitter.com/mXa5uCZukv — Bitmine BMNR (@BitMNR) July 28, 2025 Analysts had pointed out that BitMine’s stock had wildly surged earlier this month. The price shot up more than 3,000% to a yearly high of $135 on July 3 after the initial announcement of the Ether‑buying strategy. That rally was met with a wave of profit‑taking once the plan was fully laid out. Many traders sold into the strength, and the mood shifted quickly when shareholders saw the fine print. Based on reports from Kronos Research, treasury rollouts on this scale require a solid plan to protect capital and maintain liquidity. Vincent Liu, Kronos’s chief investment officer, warned that without clear steps for custody and staking infrastructure, holding large amounts of Ether could create big swings in value. And those swings spooked some investors when Lee’s “Chairman’s Message” failed to pin down exact timelines or reveal audit partners. On top of that, the implied $60,000 target for Ether came from sources that remain unnamed. That lack of transparency set off alarm bells. Investors want to know who did the math and whether the data holds up under scrutiny. When price targets are presented without clear attribution, doubt grows fast. Meanwhile, other firms are also loading up on Ether. SharpLink Gaming controls 438,000 ETH. Bit Digital holds over 100,000 ETH. Blockchain Technology Consensus Solutions recently boosted its stake to 29,122 ETH after raising $62 million. Finality Capital’s partner David Grider compared the trend to Strategy’s big bet on Bitcoin—saying these moves should help ETH flows and price action. Finality Capital, he disclosed, holds a position in BitMine itself. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Meta Stock Price Levels to Watch Ahead of Facebook Parent's Earnings Report

Shares in Meta Platforms (META) rose to start the week ahead of the tech giant’s highly anticipated quarterly earnings report, due after Wednesday’s close. Investors will pay close attention to the company’s AI infrastructure spending plans after its Magnificent Seven rival, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), last week raised its 2025 capital expenditures projection by $10 billion to $85 billion. Meta has said it expects to spend $64 billion to $72 billion in capex this year, a figure Wells Fargo analysts expect to reach $76.7 billion in 2026. The stock gained 0.7% on Monday to finish the session near $718. Meta shares have risen 23% since the start of the year as of Monday’s close, boosted by the company’s ongoing efforts to fortify its AI position among its big tech peers. Below, we take a closer look at Meta’s chart and use technical analysis to identify key price levels worth watching out for. After hitting an all-time high last month, Meta shares have undergone a pullback toward the respected 50-day moving average (MA) ahead of the tech giant’s quarterly results. However, the relative strength index sits above neutral territory, indicating price momentum remains positive. It’s worth pointing out that trading volume in the stock has remained subdued in recent months, suggesting that larger market participants are waiting for the company’s report before deploying further capital. Let’s identify two key overhead areas to watch on Meta’s chart and also locate support levels worth monitoring during potential retracements. The first overhead area to watch sits around $740. The shares could face significant overhead selling pressure in this location near price action situated just below the stock’s prominent February and June peaks. If the stock moves into price discovery above last month’s record high, investors can forecast a target using bars pattern analysis, a chart technique that analyzes prior trends to project future directional movements. When applying the technique to Meta’s chart, we take the stock’s trend higher from November to February and reposition it from this month’s low. The analysis forecasts a bullish target of around $930, implying 30% upside from Monday’s closing price. We selected this earlier move as it commenced following a retracement to the 50-day MA, providing clues as to how a similar uptrend from the indicator may take shape. During retracements in the stock, it’s initially worth watching the $680 level. This area could provide support near a range of corresponding trading activity that formed on the chart between February and June. Finally, a deeper pullback could see Meta shares revisit lower support around $635, currently just above the upward sloping 200-day MA. Investors may look for entry points in this location near a series of peaks and troughs on the chart from December to May.

Title: Up 80% This Year What's Next For Celestica Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/07/29/up-80-this-year-whats-next-for-celestica-stock/
Time Published: 2025-07-29T09:30:29Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Celestica (NYSE:CLS) has recently been experiencing significant growth — the stock has risen 80% year-to-date and has more than tripled in value over the past year. What factors are contributing to this increase? The company, recognized for its electronics manufacturing and supply chain services, is benefiting from a surge in demand for AI-powered networking equipment and cloud infrastructure, driven by major technology companies. This upswing is spurring rapid expansion in its Connectivity & Cloud Solutions (CCS) division — a segment that encompasses everything from servers and storage to high-performance networking hardware. In Q1 2025, CCS revenue reached $1.84 billion, an increase of 28% compared to the previous year. The key AI-related offerings within this segment include servers, integrated rack solutions, and high-performance networking switches, all of which are essential for modern AI workloads. The extensive AI boom is projected to maintain demand. Major technology firms are currently engaged in unprecedented cycles of infrastructure investment. Amazon is anticipated to allocate as much as $105 billion for capital expenditures in 2025. Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta are estimated to invest $80 billion, $75 billion, and $72 billion, respectively — much of this directed towards AI infrastructure. This trend should bolster demand for Celestica. How does the stock’s fundamental outlook appear, and will its momentum continue? The stock appears relatively expensive — making it a costly choice to purchase at its current price of around $170. We identify some minor concerns regarding CLS stock. Our conclusion is derived by comparing the current valuation of CLS stock with its operational performance in recent years, in addition to its current and historical financial status. Our assessment of Celestica along crucial metrics of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience indicates that the company possesses a strong operational performance and financial health, as outlined below. However, if you are looking for potential gains with reduced volatility compared to individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative — having outperformed the S&P 500 and yielded returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Also see: QuantumScape: QS Stock To $0? Celestica’s valuation seems high when assessed against the wider market. While its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 2.0 is less than the S&P 500’s 3.1, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 47.8 is considerably higher than the benchmark’s 22.8. Nevertheless, this is supported by the company's robust recent top-line growth. Revenues have risen at an average annual rate of 19.3% over the past three years, significantly surpassing the S&P 500’s 5.3%. Over the last year, Celestica’s Revenues increased by 21% to reach $10 billion, while the S&P 500 only managed a modest growth of 4.4%. However, its profitability remains behind. The net income margin over the past year was only 4.1% (compared to 11.9% for the S&P 500). Nonetheless, operating performance is showing positive trends, with Celestica achieving a record adjusted operating margin of 7.1% in the latest quarter, up from 5.9% in Q1 2024. This upward margin trend and strong revenue should, in time, lead to higher earnings, potentially justifying the company's elevated valuation. From a financial health perspective, Celestica appears robust, with a low debt-to-equity ratio of 4.8%, comfortably below the S&P 500 average of 22.6%. The company maintains a moderate cash reserve that constitutes 5.2% of its total assets. However, CLS stock has historically demonstrated sensitivity to market downturns. For example, during the Covid-19 market crash, CLS plummeted 69% compared to a 33.9% drop in the S&P 500. Likewise, in 2022, amid inflation-related shocks, the stock fell 35.6% during a broader market correction, exceeding the S&P’s 25.4% decline. Additional risks also exist. The company has a significant manufacturing presence in Asia (approximately two-thirds of production), and tariffs imposed by the U.S. government may elevate supply chain costs and exert pressure on profit margins. The high valuation of CLS stock may restrict its upside potential in the near to mid-term. As an alternative, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices), has produced strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided an effective strategy to capitalize on favorable market conditions while mitigating losses during market downturns, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Microsoft Stock Up More Than Amazon. Don’t Buy Into AI-Staff Cuts

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Companies touting AI-driven job cuts rarely see significant stock gains, with most performing only slightly better than the S&P 500.Only Microsoft has achieved market-beating returns by consistently exceeding expectations and leveraging AI for growth.True stock value comes from beating expectations and raising guidance, not just headcount reduction. Companies are bragging about their staff cuts even as they invest heavily in artificial intelligence, The Wall Street Journal reported. Only one company – Microsoft – could enjoy market-beating returns. A closer look at the eight companies highlighted – Microsoft, Wells Fargo, Loomis, Bank of America, Verizon, Amazon, Intel and Union Pacific – reveals an important insight for investors: On average, the companies have posted mediocre gains this year – up 9.3% compared to an 8.9% rise in the S&P 500 as of July 25, according to Google Finance. Here’s why you should think twice before investing in the shares of companies promoting their headcount reduction in the wake of AI deployments: Microsoft is the only one of the eight that beat and raised for the last four quarters. Since it is also getting growth from its AI investments, the company’s stock may be the only one of the eight likely to deliver above average investor returns. The average stock price increase of the companies touting their AI-driven job cuts is just slightly ahead of the S&P 500’s increase so far in 2025. Below are the companies along with their stock price change this year as of July 25 and what they have said about their job cuts: Job cut announcements rarely benefit investors. Moreover, such news tends to produce at most 2% stock price increases – if management convinces investors the layoffs are part of a broader AI strategy to enhance productivity. Even such modest bumps last one to three trading days, according to academic research such as Stock investors’ reaction to layoff announcements: A meta-analysis. Moreover, if the layoffs are seen as a reaction to weak demand or lack a clear efficiency narrative, returns are flat or negative, academic research suggests. So what makes investors better off? Stock prices tend to rise when companies beat investor expectations and raise their guidance. “Positive earnings surprises and upward guidance revisions typically lead to positive stock price reactions,” according to quantitative evidence from academic literature such as Warp Speed Price Moves: Jumps after Earnings Announcements. Microsoft has outperformed the other seven companies when it comes to beating revenue and earnings per share expectations and raising guidance ahead of investor views over the last four quarters. More specifically, Microsoft has surpassed investor revenue and EPS expectations in the most recent four quarters and provided positive guidance for the future – which in some cases exceeded consensus estimates. These results suggest Microsoft is monetizing its AI initiatives through growth in demand for its cloud services, according to the company’s Q1 2025 earnings call transcript. Amazon and Intel shares have fallen short of the S&P 500’s return over the last year. The shares of both companies took a beating because they did not consistently exceed investors’ revenue expectations and their guidance was disappointing. For instance, Amazon beat analysts’ EPS expectations each quarter but did not consistently exceed their revenue estimates. Moreover, investors have expressed concern over the e-commerce giant’s sometimes cautious guidance for future quarters, reported Yahoo! Finance. Intel suffered from slightly different problems. The chip giant consistently surpassed revenue estimates in the last four quarters but often missed EPS expectations and provided guidance for future quarters that often fallen short of investor expectations – indicating ongoing challenges in their turnaround strategy, noted Investing.com. Companies that tout their job cuts may repel top talent – which could slow their growth. So, consider investing in the ones that consistently beat expectations and raise guidance above consensus with help from AI investments that yield faster growth.

Title: Trump's trade deals are set to unleash an 11% rally for stocks through year-end, Oppenheimer says

Call it a comeback. After markets went haywire in April, Trump's trade deals might have just saved the bull market, according to Oppenheimer's chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus. After lowering his year-end S&P 500 price target after the Liberation Day tariff announcements, Stoltzfus has reinstated his 7,100 target from December 2024, setting the stock market up for its third consecutive year of 20% gains. In the wake of President Donald Trump's EU and Japan trade deal, Stoltzfus believes the coast is clear for the S&P 500 to continue reaching all-time highs. "We believe that enough 'tariff hurdles' have been overcome for now to reinstate our original price target for the S&P 500 of 7100 by year-end," Stoltzfus wrote in a note on Monday morning. US exceptionalism in the stock market remains intact, Stoltzfus said. The EU trade deal Trump announced on Sunday sets tariffs of 15% on most European imports, half of the 30% Trump initially threatened. The EU has also agreed to purchase a "vast amount" of US military equipment and invest an additional $600 billion in the US. It's not just trade deals, though. US companies have held up financially through the volatility, and they're on track for a better-than-expected second quarter earnings season, Stoltzfus said. Out of the companies that have already reported second quarter earnings, 84% have beaten analyst estimates. Wall Street will be watching this week closely, as 164 companies — including the S&P 500's biggest names such as Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta —are set to report results. Helping the S&P 500's continued climb is the slow place of inflation. Price increases have remained relatively steady and inflation has drawn closer to the Fed's 2% target despite tariff volatility. "Monetary policy by the Fed has brought down the pace of inflation (if not yet to its 2% target level) without thus far causing a recession. This in our view is a substantial achievement considering inflation has gone from 9% in June of 2022 when the Fed recognized that inflation was out of hand to around 2.7% in June of this year," Stoltzfus wrote. Stoltzfus' 7,100 year-end price target implies a forward multiple of 25.8x and an earnings projection of $275. Investors should continue to bet on information technology, consumer discretionary, communications services, industrials, and financials, according to Stoltzfus. Jump to

Download the schedule (PDF) HOPE_16 Opening Ceremonies It all starts Friday morning. Join us as we make sure everything works before another HOPE is unleashed on everyone. Friday 1045 Marillac Auditorium Activism, Hactivism, and the Law Alex Muentz Protest has become more important and more dangerous in the U.S. It's harder to know where the line is between safe, lawful protest and actions that can get you sanctioned, arrested, or deported. Alex will discuss how to assess the risks you face in online and in-person protests, ranging from pickets to dropping docs. Friday 1600 Marillac Auditorium Aging Cyber Safely Laura Sang Hee Scherling, Josefina Piddo This presentation asks how we can better care for our older adults and improve cybersecurity awareness training and policies with their needs in mind. American adults over the age of 60 filed over 100,000 cybercrime-related complaints to the FBI in 2023 and experienced losses amounting to $3.2 billion. Older adults are the most vulnerable to cybercrime, and studies have found they feel ashamed to disclose having been victims. Although important initiatives exist, such as AllState's training sessions on cyber safety and AARP's free fraud helpline, there's a noticeable shortage in relevant resources. This research examines emerging cybersecurity awareness resources and policies supporting older adults, drawing from interviews with FINRA and the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC). It also presents findings from the cybersecurity awareness initiative founded by the presenters: the Cyber Care Institute, recently introduced to four organizations and over 100 students in New York City. Saturday 1200 Little Theatre AI Is Undermining Our Privacy. What Can We Do About It? Robert Stribley We've been grappling with evolving issues around online privacy for years now, but the recent burst in use of AI or LLMs (large language models) has quickly introduced new and sometimes alarming privacy concerns for both users and those creating AI experiences to consider. This talk will take a look at six specific areas where AI is undermining privacy and discuss what, if anything, we can do about them. The six areas to be discussed are: lack of transparency with data sharing, accidental exposure of personal data, reversing data anonymization, deceptive design patterns, AI listening in everywhere, and malicious misuse of AI. To end on a constructive note, eight guidelines that designers and developers can follow to ensure they're focusing on privacy when working with AI will be discussed. Sunday 1700 Little Theatre Aphantasia: A Personal Reflection Dr. Earl Brown Imagine a mind without mental images, where "picture this" has no meaning. Aphantasia - the inability to form mental images - is a little-known, rare condition that affects around one to four percent of the population. In this presentation, Earl will talk about aphantasia and how it has impacted his professional life as a pathologist and a teacher with more than 35 years of experience. He will explore its impact - both good and bad - on everyday experiences such as chess, piano, drawing, reading, memory, and learning, finally speculating on how aphantasia may affect creativity and the hacker mindset. Friday 1800 Tobin 201/202 The ARTS Open Framework Sabar Dasgupta Over the past several decades, the scientific process has relied more and more on computational analysis of data to produce digital artifacts. Fields like molecular biology, neuroscience, linguistics, and astrophysics, to name a few, have been revolutionized by this trend to the point that computational workflows are ubiquitous. Although most of these workflows are very similar at a high level - collecting data, analyzing it with code, and publishing the resulting figures - implementation details differ widely. While there exist standards such as the FAIR Guiding Principles for organizing and sharing data, there are not widely adopted standards for reliably regenerating analyses from said data, especially across compute environments. This talk presents an open framework for archived, reproducible, and transparent science (ARTS) that aims to do exactly this - by packaging data, code, and figures in containers and uploading it to a persistent, trusted, and accessible archive. Sunday 1500 Little Theatre Ask the EFF William Budington, Lena Cohen, Cara Gagliano, JosÃ© Martinez This year, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) will be returning to HOPE for a special "Ask the EFF" panel to address some of the pressing questions the hacker community has in these troubled times. Panelists will provide updates on current EFF work, including the ongoing case against the "Department" of Government Oversight, educating the public on their digital rights, organizing communities to resist ongoing government surveillance, and more. The panel will then turn it over to attendees to pose questions and receive insights on how users can protect their civil liberties online during an increasingly volatile political and world situation. Saturday 1200 Marillac Auditorium (2 hours!) ATM Hacking: Past and Present Roman Pushkin This talk explores the evolution of ATM hacking, from classic physical attacks to modern software exploits, using two real-world case studies. Roman will demonstrate how cybercriminals bypass security measures and why banks often stay silent. Attendees will see a live demo of a custom "flusher device" built for a tabletop coin dispenser (reverse-engineered from eBay), highlighting vulnerabilities in cash-handling systems. Sunday 1300 Tobin 201/202 Back to Basics: Building Resilient Cyber Defenses for Multiple Use Cases Yael Grauer In spite of novel cybersecurity threats, digital security advice has remained largely unchanged in recent years. In fact, a lot of advice in response to high-profile attacks doesn't actually address risks people are most likely to face. This talk will analyze several high-profile digital security concerns, whether viral advice to address it would have been effective, and what steps could be taken - both before and after the issue arises. You will hear of lessons learned from years of auditing and updating Security Planner, a digital security guide that provides customized plans based on responses to a few survey questions. The presentation will further delve into ways to segment digital security advice so that it's personalized to the individual, their devices, their technical capabilities, and the type of risks they're likely to face. Saturday 1600 Little Theatre Bitcoin Poker: Satoshi's Lost Game and Its Decentralized Revival Mattias Bergstrom Bitcoin v0.1.5, the last version personally coded by Satoshi Nakamoto, contains curious references to poker buried in its source code. While never officially documented, these fragments suggest that Bitcoin's original design may have envisioned more than just money; it may have included decentralized, trustless gaming. This talk will explore the historical and technical significance of these lost poker references, analyzing: What was Satoshi's intent? Was this an abandoned feature, an experiment, or an overlooked function of Bitcoin's game-theoretic design? How was poker referenced in early Bitcoin? There will be a deep dive into the code archaeology of v0.1.5 and why poker may have been included. The presentation will also include the introduction of Bitcoin Poker, a modern Rust-based reimagining of trustless, peer-to-peer poker, demonstrating how we can host fully decentralized poker games without a centralized server, use multi-signature escrows for provably fair betting and payouts, ensure post-quantum security for long-term cryptographic safety, and implement a sidechain execution model to handle high-frequency transactions without bloating the main chain. Sunday 1200 Little Theatre Bitpart: 5-In-1 Platform for Activism Over Signal Josh King Signal is one of the most critical tools we have for secure communication amongst activists, journalists, and human rights defenders. As of 2024, Signal has over 70 million active users and over 220 million downloads, with no signs of slowing down. With the global rise of the far-right and corresponding attacks on human rights, the ability to securely organize via Signal against these forces is more important than ever. To that end, Throneless Tech has embarked on an in-depth research project that resulted in the creation of Bitpart: a Rust-based software platform that allows for the creation of dynamic organizing tools on top of Signal. Depending on the end-users' tech capacity, Bitpart can be run on organizers' own self-hosted servers or through Throneless-hosted servers. The project builds on experience gained from past Signal chatbot projects, and new research conducted with targeted groups such as current organizers, activists, and journalists around the world. In this session Josh King, developer of Bitpart, will demonstrate how the platform is being used to create bots that activists can use as secure, anonymous tiplines, digital helpdesks, broadcast lists, a tool to distribute eSIMs, and a tool to share VPN download codes. Participants will come away with an understanding of how Signal can be utilized in novel ways, how to think through the threat model and risk assessment for creating secure tools for activists, and how Bitpart can be expanded upon and applied to their own communities. Friday 2000 Little Theatre Both Sides of the Wire: Surveillance, Whistleblowing, and Building a Cyber Peace Movement John Kiriakou As a former CIA officer who exposed the agency's torture program, John Kiriakou paid the price with his freedom. In addition to disclosing wrongdoing, he understands surveillance from the inside. This talk brings together that firsthand knowledge with a challenge to the hacker community: we must pursue a cybersecurity model rooted in cooperation, transparency, and peace rather than conflict. This talk will explain how today's digital ecosystems - including both software and hardware - are vulnerable not only to technical compromise but also to political manipulation. The threats we face are not just from malicious actors or hostile governments, but from within our own systems. Co-opted code, opaque procurement processes, and surveillance-by-design continue to erode public trust. It is time to reclaim the hacker ethos and direct it toward a global cyber peace movement. Here you will learn why hackers, technologists, and civil society must lead this effort, and how the only sustainable security is one built collaboratively, with integrity and purpose. Saturday 1600 Marillac Auditorium Bridging the Decentralized Gap: Shared Hacker Values, Cypherpunk Roots, and the Future of Blockchains Alexander Urbelis, Phil Daian, Harry Halpin This panel will delve into the deep-rooted connections between hacker and cypherpunk culture and the evolution of Ethereum and blockchain technology, tracing their shared emphasis on decentralization, privacy, and open-source principles. By revisiting the historical context of the 1990s Crypto Wars and projects like PGP and Tor, the discussion will highlight how these early movements laid the groundwork for the vision of a trustless, user-sovereign Internet. The panel also will aim to debunk common misconceptions that associate blockchains solely with scams or speculation, showcasing real-world applications such as the Ethereum Name Service and privacy-preserving technologies, while emphasizing the ecosystem's pivot towards public goods and accessibility. Ultimately, the conversation will underscore the enduring, collaborative vision of both hacker and blockchain communities - advancing censorship resistance, user empowerment, financial privacy, and a decentralized digital future. Saturday 2000 Little Theatre Build a Tech Community in Your Neighborhood, One Hackathon at a Time William Hutson This talk chronicles the journey of creating a vibrant tech community through short, accessible two-hour mini-hackathons that lower barriers to participation. The speaker shares their experience of building Flushing Tech's successful bi-weekly hackathon program, and provides a practical roadmap for you to try this at home in your own neighborhood. Leave with actionable guidelines for starting similar initiatives that emphasize the importance of creating an inclusive environment that welcomes participants of all skill levels while maintaining enough technical focus to drive meaningful project development. This talk is ideal for community organizers, tech enthusiasts, and anyone interested in fostering grassroots innovation in their local area. Saturday 1100 Tobin 201/202 Bureaucracy Hacking - Creating Organizational Exploit Chains for Good Adam L. Hesch At their core, all bureaucracies are, fundamentally, information systems, containing the ability to store information, compute information, and share information over a network. This means they all can be hacked. In this funny, enriching, and ultimately inspirational talk, the concept of "bureaucracy hacking" will be discussed as a way to make a difference in any organization of any size, even (perhaps most especially) when you feel like "just a cog in the machine." The talk will be suitable for a novice audience of any background, with high level references to traditional information security, hacking, and of course social engineering principles. What will make it unique and interesting will be particular emphasis on the exploitation of the emergent and unique properties of bureaucracies. It will be most actionable by young, idealistic entrants into the workforce. And, it may yet inspire the younger versions of ourselves inside each of us that our (warranted) cynicism has led us to ignore or forget (at our peril). Stories will come from the speaker's (and others') experiences at organizations like Meta, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Navy, and others. It is intended as a rebuttal to, and toolkit for, countering "Pournelle's iron law of bureaucracy." Sunday 1000 Marillac Auditorium Claw Back Your Data From Big Tech With Cyd Micah Lee, redshiftzero Tech platforms can't be trusted. Oligarchs and billionaires want you to keep giving your data to their Big Tech companies for free so they can sell it and manipulate you into believing nonsense. In this talk, the Lockdown Systems collective will introduce Cyd, their open source desktop app that makes it easy for people to reclaim control over their data from Big Tech. Giving users actual control over their data is challenging when dealing with hostile, enshittified tech platforms like X and Facebook. Cyd bypasses all of that though by putting the user in the driver's seat: it runs on the user's own computer, from their own IP address, and it works by automating a web browser on their behalf - and sometimes relying on APIs, when they're available, free, and don't suck. It doesn't share any access to your accounts or your data with the Lockdown Systems collective. Attendees will learn how Cyd works under the hood, how you can use it, and how you can contribute to building tools that challenge the dominance of Big Tech. Friday 1700 Marillac Auditorium Communication and Movement in Internet Shutdown Protests: Rethinking Mesh Messaging Cora Rowena Ruiz 2024 was the worst year for Internet shutdowns ever recorded, with nearly 296 documented events across 54 countries. Frequently imposed during protests and times of unrest, shutdowns are commonly used as a tactic to suppress dissent and restrict communication. Mesh messaging is widely hailed as a potential workaround, yet these tools are generally considered unreliable, untrusted, and ultimately go unused. Mesh systems depend heavily on the spatial relationships between nodes, but existing research on how people move and communicate in protest settings is sparse. This talk explores a holistic approach to mesh tool design, grounded in qualitative firsthand experiences to build effective blackout-resistant mesh tools. Saturday 2000 Tobin 201/202 Computational Techniques for Making Karaoke Harder Jamie Brew Robot Karaoke is a live comedy show that swaps lyrics with fragments of text drawn from a catalog of esoteric datasets (quora questions, web banner ads, tax forms, and more) to create and sing never-before-sung karaoke songs. This talk covers how the data is sourced, how the songs are phonetically annotated, and how the show is run and the core software (the Weird Algorithm) developed. The presentation will end with a demo of the future of karaoke. Saturday 2100 Little Theatre The Computer Underground Scene - Past, Present, and Future Netspooky (Phrack / HCC), TMZ ( Phrack / tmp.Out), Skyper (THC / ex-Phrack), John Threat (Masters of Deception), Bill Budington (Electronic Frontier Foundation) This is a brainstorming session together with the audience. The panel will talk and unravel a bit about the past and present, and try to find a shared vision of where we are or should be heading. Sunday 1300 Marillac Auditorium (2 hours!) Counter-Surveillance as Activism: Using Cameras Against State Violence in Israel/Palestine Aman Abhishek Palestinian, Israeli, and international anti-occupation activists in Israel/Palestine have been using cameras to deter and document violence from Israeli security forces and settlers for around two decades. Human rights organizations first started distributing cameras in the mid-2000s to facilitate documentation, and today, essentially every anti-occupation activist in the West Bank and Jerusalem carries some combination of video cameras, smartphones, and body cameras to deter and document state-settler violence. The activists also take it upon themselves to take the videos to journalists, human rights organizations, courts, and elsewhere; recently, this activism was the focus of the Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land. This talk will describe how activists organize, what happens to the footage, how this activism changed after October 7th, and what this all means for thinking about counter-surveillance as a strategic response to state violence. Sunday 1200 Marillac Auditorium Cracking Enigma: A Chronology of Cryptographic Breakthroughs Brais Macknik-Conde The Enigma machine was a sophisticated encryption device used by Nazi Germany during World War II. Its mechanical design utilized three rotors that scrambled plaintext into complex ciphertext, with additional layers of security from unique internal settings. However, inherent weaknesses and poor operational procedures left it vulnerable to cryptanalysis. The first successful attacks on Enigma were conducted by Polish mathematicians in the early 1930s. By exploiting repeating message indicators and rotor cycle patterns, they deduced rotor wirings and constructed replica Enigma machines. Their breakthroughs enabled systematic decryption until German countermeasures in 1938 forced new approaches. Alan Turing and his team at Bletchley Park refined these methods, pioneering statistical techniques and mechanical computation to accelerate decryption. Techniques such as Banburismus and the Good-Turing estimation method were created under Turing's leadership. The development of the Bombe machine allowed rapid elimination of incorrect rotor settings, enabling the Allies to decipher vast amounts of enemy communication. This presentation will focus on history and cryptography, examining how breaking Enigma provided critical intelligence that shaped Allied strategies and shortened the war by an estimated two years, saving millions of lives in one of humankind's most significant intelligence operations. Saturday 1800 Tobin 201/202 CRXaminer - Deep Dive Into Chrome Extensions (Plus Tool) Mark El-Khoury You spend your time configuring HTTP headers and hardening your containers. Meanwhile your CFO just downloaded a Chrome extension to make the font in Gmail Comic Sans. What are Chrome extensions, exactly? This talk will dive into details, including format, contents, static analysis with custom rules, threat modeling (when does this even matter?), and some of the unique challenges of building a security scanner. A tool will be demoed that has just been released for this: CRXaminer (crxaminer.tech). You will learn how you can immediately start using it. Friday 1400 Tobin 201/202 Dark Web Digger: Modular Scraping for Dark Web Intel Samantha Stortz, Dominick Foti Dark web forums are a major resource for the hacking community and play a large role in the spread of information, data leaks, tools, services, and related transactions. While it is common for users to keep similar usernames and identifiers across different forums to maintain their credibility, these users often need to create or change accounts. The prototype presented here looks to tie anonymized accounts to the same user, as they will likely have similar language usage, post content, tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs). The presenters developed a modular web scraper that can extract data from forums and store said data for analysis. They explore opportunities to leverage machine learning techniques to automate and enhance the process of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) analysis in the future. This includes using natural language processing (NLP) to digitally fingerprint users based on speech patterns, trend detection between users and forums, and even a chatbot to assist the tool's users in finding specific information. The project provides analysts with a wholistic view of how users interact on these forums, making it more functional and versatile. Friday 1100 Marillac Auditorium Data Autonomy: Counter-Surveillance Strategies for Civil Society Marlon Kautz The surveillance apparatus in the West is going critical, and civil society is not prepared for the fallout. Political leadership is explicitly targeting NGOs and social movements using surveillance capabilities that have been perfected over the past decade. This talk will evaluate the merits and limitations of different counter-surveillance approaches from the vantage point of grassroots organizers, and go beyond the stock advice of "use Signal and a VPN" to offer proposals for defeating state surveillance through technical infrastructure development and political organizing. Friday 2100 Little Theatre Design for Neurodiversity: Creating Neuro-Inclusive Spaces Dorothy Howard This talk will explore the concept of neurodiversity and its implications for designing events and spaces with neurodivergent people's diverse needs in mind. The neurodiversity paradigm promotes embracing neurological differences, emerging from the autistic rights and disability justice movements of the 1990s. Accessibility guides and resources rarely focus on neuro-inclusive design. The presentation will highlight strategies for creating neuro-inclusive environments informed by research in education, including examples such as low-sensory rooms in libraries and conferences. Attendees will be encouraged to reflect on how neuro-inclusive design can benefit the communities they engage with. Saturday 1400 Tobin 201/202 DIY Police Scanner With SDRs and Open Source Software nop Police accountability requires transparency, but access to relevant information is frequently hindered by collaborators in government or the police themselves. Fortunately there is one source of info we can take into our own hands: their radios. Police in the United States largely use the digital, trunked radio system "Project 25." We can listen in to this using spare computers, a few Software Defined Radios (SDRs), and open source software. Even better, we can go far beyond what very simple broadcastify-style dispatch streams offer, like having our own archives of radio traffic. Based on an actual system that sees real-world use, this talk will cover how to set up your very own DIY police scanner. Ansible playbooks and supporting scripts to streamline the process will be released, and practical tips and lessons for real-world applications of such a system will be covered. Saturday 1900 Marillac Auditorium Eco-Hacking Desire: The Intersection of Pornography, Sex, and Environmental Impact Jasmin Hagendorfer This talk explores the intersection of desire and sustainability, examining how even our most intimate moments leave an environmental footprint. The concept of sexecology, coined by Annie Sprinkle and Beth Stephens, bridges environmentalism and sexuality in creative ways. From solar-powered vibrators to eco-friendly sex toys, the session delves into the often overlooked world of green sex tech and eco-erotic practices. Key questions explored will include: What are the true environmental costs of online pornography? How sustainable is our streaming culture and AI technologies? Can DIY pleasure practices be a form of political activism? What role does ethical pornography play in envisioning a better future? The discussion will also cover energy consumption, server loads, and the hidden costs behind virtual acts of desire. The focus is not to shame desire, but to empower it with awareness, curiosity, and hacker ethics. The speaker, a feminist activist and artist, aims to foster a dialogue about how digital intimacy can become more visible, accountable, and hackable. This talk invites the hacker community and beyond to collaborate in rethinking the infrastructures behind online pleasure and to explore ways of making the environmental impact of these systems more transparent. Friday 1900 Little Theatre Esolangs as a Hacker Folk Art Daniel Temkin The most important computational art is happening far from museums, immersive art "experiences," and the smoldering ruins of NFT platforms. Esolangs, like demos and code golf, are hacker folk art, born entirely outside the art world, yet beginning to get wider attention as more digital artists and poets contribute to the form. This should not be a surprise with the critical work it has done to explore our relationship with technology, the politics of computing, the aesthetics of code, among many other subjects. This talk will present esolangs, not as a loose collection of language associated by algorithmic complexity, but a social history of how each language influenced the next, drawing from ten years of interviews for the blog esoteric.codes. It will look at esolangs as more than technical wizardry and consider aesthetics for this form that often pretends to eschew aesthetics entirely. Friday 2000 Tobin 201/202 Expanding the BioArtBot Color Palette - A Beginner's guide to Lab Automation and Biosafety Danny Chan bioartbot.org/ is a project for encouraging curiosity in microbiology and lab automation through creative expression. It is an open source project built on a pipetting robot that draws user submitted pixel art by placing colored bacteria on agar. Using the story of the BioArtBot development as a guide, this talk will provide a basic overview of the technologies (hardware, software, and wetware) implemented in the BioArtBot. It will describe how lab automation is used in biotech companies, how it might be used by amateur/community investigators, and how the BioArtBot is an interesting framework to contribute to if you are looking to skill-up in lab automation. It will also describe how the living pigments for this project were created and sourced, how you might create/source your own, and the amazing diversity of living chemical refineries that are bacteria. So if you're interested in robots and bacteria, come find out how we can command our tireless inorganic creations to deposit aesthetically pleasing arrangements of the ancient form-factor of all life. Saturday 2100 Tobin 201/202 Exploiting Emergent Property-Based Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models David Kuszmar As AI technology expands across both benign and malicious applications, our understanding of the attack surface must evolve to account for emergent properties in complex systems. In large language models, these emergent behaviors create novel classes of vulnerabilities that are not only unpatched, but largely unrecognized. By systematically manipulating the model's limited perception of reality, attackers can induce cascading failures that go far beyond traditional filter bypasses, exposing fundamental weaknesses in the internal logic and contextual binding of these systems. This session will unpack how these vulnerabilities work, walk through real examples, and explore the far-reaching implications for AI security, governance, and safety. Sunday 1400 Tobin 201/202 The Five Pillars for Rewriting History and Culture Alexander J. Urbelis, Daniel Nowak, Roel Schouwenberg From printing press to blockchain, technological advances reshape historical narratives across five pillars: finance, governance, faith, communications, and consciousness. Influential entities employ sophisticated cyber and information solutions to manipulate resources and power. Governments, corporations, and NGOs manage narratives, shaping opinion and obscuring truths as they manage perception. Religious groups use digital platforms to spread doctrine, blurring traditional faith boundaries. Social media and emerging technologies amplify disinformation worldwide. These operations exploit cognitive vulnerabilities, reshaping collective memory and fueling evolving consciousness. This talk will examine how technology-driven psychological operations can unmake historical canons, normalizing new realities and marginalizing dissent. The presenters will highlight ethical dilemmas and stress the urgent need for transparency, critical awareness, and decentralization across all pillars. Lastly, they will offer recommendations for how the individual can remain resilient in the face of these existential threats and multifaceted Manichean devils. Friday 1200 Marillac Auditorium The Free Software Movement: Where It Came From, What It Means to Me, and What It Could Mean to You Craig Topham This talk is the journey of Craig's discovery of the free software movement and how it solved his need to find a position in the fight for a better tomorrow. The hope is to inspire others to share this viewpoint of free software and to see how it is a critical factor for civilization if we want to avoid the nightmare dystopia which awaits us all if the free software movement fails. Saturday 1600 Tobin 201/202 From Activism to Hacktivism: Resisting Digital Repression Gabrielle Joni Verreault, Elina Castillo-Jimnez, Jane Eklund, Ken Mayers (Moderator) This panel discussion will offer insights into the challenges faced by human rights defenders and hacktivists in today's context of intensified digital repression, including surveillance, censorship, and cyberwarfare. The three panelists will report from the frontlines, sharing their technical expertise and experiences living among activists and supporting them in their work in different countries. Topics will include hacktivism in Ukraine, disrupting surveillance in Serbia and Thailand, and tech and reproductive rights in the USA and worldwide. Each panelist will briefly share their stories and insights, and then the discussion between them and the audience will be opened. Saturday 2100 Marillac Auditorium The Future of Email Is Open Dejan Å trbac, William Lessard Email is one of our most essential tools, yet it's controlled by a handful of corporations that scan, monetize, and gate-keep our communication. In this talk, the presenters will introduce OpenEmail, a ground-up re-imagining of async communication built on a radically simple, open protocol. Designed for privacy, integrity, and interoperability, OpenEmail combines end-to-end encryption; decentralized delivery; and a public, extensible architecture to give users true ownership of their communication, and developers the freedom to build on top of an open social protocol. They will explore how a spam-free, surveillance-free inbox, where messages are trustworthy by design, can reclaim the Internet as a space for open, human connection, free from Big Tech. More than just a talk, this is a call to arms: to take back control of our communication and build a digital future that serves people, not profit. Saturday 1900 Little Theatre Getting Out of DOGE: A Discussion With a Former DOGE Engineer Adam Klasfeld, Sahil Lavingia The whole world has been watching as the "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE), the partnership between Elon Musk and the Trump administration, has worked to fulfill its pledge to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government. Despite promises to the contrary, there has been very little transparency about DOGE or its operations - until now. Join Adam Klasfeld, a former MSNBC legal contributor and founder of All Rise News, as he interviews Sahil Lavingia, a former DOGE engineer. This discussion aims to reveal what DOGE is really doing behind the scenes and offer the public a unique chance to ask direct questions to someone who was there. Friday 1400 Marillac Auditorium Hackers Got Talent Jason Scott & Friends It just wouldn't be HOPE without another installment of "Hackers Got Talent." This is an opportunity for hackers from all around the planet to show off their talents in this cheeky display of hacker (and totally non-hacker) skills. Just sign up at InfoDesk and the talent you decide to share is entirely up to you. (Seriously, anything you're good at is a talent.) Hacker archivist Jason Scott will again be on hand to keep everything moving. Judging will be done by a combination of panelists and audience members. First place wins a valuable prize! Second place... we'll see. Saturday 2200 Marillac Auditorium (2 hours!) Hacking for Social Justice Danacea Vo "How can my hacking skills become a force for advancing social justice?" Those who ponder this question often know what they're up against - oppression, inequality, enshitification.... But the path toward building meaningful change can feel unclear or overwhelming. This talk draws from years of experience working alongside activists, human rights defenders, and digital organizers, and offers a practical framework for lasting, meaningful change. You'll gain social impact strategies that will help you align your technical skills with the movements and communities you care about. If you've ever felt the call to do more - with purpose, with clarity, with community - this is your invitation. Saturday 1900 Tobin 201/202 Hacking Search: Kagi's Revolt Against the Ad-Tech Machine Vladimir Prelovac You know the drill: search for official travel info, get an overcharging third-party site. Look for a hotel, get a misleading aggregator. "Free" search costs you time, money, and trust. Kagi is the revolt - a paid, obsessively user-centric search engine architected to serve you, not the advertisers. This session reveals how Kagi sidesteps the surveillance model, leveraging diverse sources and AI tools (under your control) to deliver clean, customizable results. Founder Vlad Prelovac will detail the tech choices enabling genuine user agency (blocking SEO garbage, elevating trusted sources via filters), the challenge of building viable alternatives outside the ad-tech ecosystem, and the fight to restore user agency against data-hoarding monopolies. If you're tired of being the product on the web, join the resistance. Saturday 1300 Little Theatre Hacking the Future at Tesla Science Center Michael Caprio, Jeffrey Velez, Ed Wilson The year 2026 marks the 170th birthday of Nikola Tesla and will also be the year that the grounds of his Wardenclyffe laboratory will at last open to the public. Learn about the latest goings-on from Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe detailing their visitor center renovation and opening; development of their amateur radio station and radio club; expansion of their public and educational programming with space science courses, events, and hackathons; a future hackerspace; and more exciting projects! Sunday 1100 Marillac Auditorium Hacking the Tech-Industrial Complex: Learning to See Invisible Systems Seth Godin The author of more than 20 international bestsellers gives us an inside view of the systems that drive our culture. Every dominant system works to maintain itself, and we can find strategies and stories that push to make things better. Saturday 1100 Marillac Auditorium Hack the Violin Part 2: The Advanced Stuff - This Time There's AI Andrew Morican, Ebmbat This is a follow-on from "Hack the Violin: A Hacker's Approach to Learning, Playing, and Teaching the Violin" from Hope XV. This will be a look at technology, most notably AI and hacking the violin. You will learn what's out there and what the presenters were able to achieve with their own AI project regarding practicing and engagement. You will also learn about AI with live performance and creation, as well as AI and string sampling - and see how sampling may be altering the stringscape. Friday 1300 Little Theatre Hardware Hacking Meets Art: How Movie Special Effects Are Made Davis DeWitt Step into the world of movie magic with Davis DeWitt, a filmmaker, inventor, and former Mythbuster and learn how combining hardware hacking with art creates objects that do more than function: they evoke emotion and tell stories. From blowing up cars to building robots with personality, this talk will explore why it's important to tackle projects that blur the lines between disciplines. Friday 1900 Marillac Auditorium HOPE_16 Badge - No Badge, No Problem Victoria Joh, Vinicius Fortuna Electronic badges have become a focal point of hacking conferences and key to growing the immersive conference experience! This talk will provide a brief history of electronic conference badges, as well as discuss the good, the badge, and the ugly from the speakers' attempt at a new and improved production run this year. Sadly, while there will not be a new production of the improved HOPE badge in time for the con to be shared with HOPE_16 attendees, this will still be a lively discussion of everyone's favorite badges from past hacking conferences. The design and production challenges that inevitably cropped up will be discussed in detail. The struggle to produce a working badge aligning both funding and functionality is real. This year has been no exception, with various uncertainties such as tariffs and geopolitical norms at play. Despite the challenges, many lessons have been learned. This is an opportunity to plan for a future run, share experiences with others, and get more interested individuals to join the team and get involved. Saturday 1400 Little Theatre How a Handful of Location Data Brokers Actively Track Millions, and How to Stop Them Bill Budington, Lena Cohen In the past year, a number of investigations have revealed the outsized role of a few select companies in gathering, storing, and selling the location data of millions of devices - and by extension people - worldwide. These companies largely use technologies which power the online advertising industry in order to collect and disseminate this data. To make matters worse, this data has been both provided to private investigators on the mere assurance that they plan to work with law enforcement, and has been subject to data breaches which put the privacy of millions at risk. This talk will elaborate on the technologies, data flows, and industry players which comprise this complicated ecosystem. Most importantly, it will cover some basic steps you can perform to protect yourself against the wide array of location privacy harms your device subjects you to. The presenters will show tools and techniques they've developed to allow users to take back ownership of our devices, rather than our devices owning us. Friday 1500 Marillac Auditorium How I Used and Abused LLMs to Get Top 250 on HTB Rambo Anderson-You This talk explores an experiment in giving AI system-wide access to compete on Hack The Box (HTB). The talk details the development of a semiautonomous workflow for capture the flag (CTF) competitions, involving jailbreaks, LLM switching, and hardware. Through iterative diagrams, the talk traces how the workflow evolved as the AI improved at capturing flags. This presentation considers how this CTF solving AI slop might extend to real world scenarios like penetration testing, red teaming, and bug bounty hunting. Sunday 1500 Tobin 201/202 How Law Enforcement Agencies Compromise Entire Encrypted Chat Platforms Joseph Cox Law enforcement agencies compromising entire encrypted communication platforms to read peoples' messages is no longer an outlier. It is the new normal. That includes the FBI taking a tech startup called Anom and inserting its own backdoor, French authorities pushing a malicious update to tens of thousands of EncroChat devices, European cops hacking another company called Sky, or any of the increasing number of related cases. In this talk, Joseph Cox, co-founder of 404 Media and author of Dark Wire will detail police tactics, pulling from his nearly ten years of covering the encrypted phone industry. Saturday 1400 Marillac Auditorium How to Be Positively Transgressive: Hacking Culture for Good Johannes Grenzfurthner (monochrom) In an era where transgression has been co-opted by reactionary forces, how can we reclaim subversion as a tool for positive change? Historically, countercultures, hackers, and artists have used disruption to challenge power structures, expose hypocrisy, and expand the boundaries of what is possible. Yet today, the same methods - culture jamming, media pranks, and ideological infiltration - are increasingly wielded by ultra-right movements to erode democratic values and spread reactionary narratives. This talk will explore how we can re-hack the hacker mindset: How can we use transgressivity in ways that are constructive rather than destructive? How do we subvert without merely burning things down? Can we retool the aesthetics and tactics of countercultural rebellion to push society forward instead of backward? Through historical examples, personal experiences, and a healthy dose of mischievous strategy, this talk will try to outline actionable ways to engage in cultural hacking that disrupt oppressive systems while reinforcing community, inclusivity, and progressive values. Because giving up on the tools of subversion means surrendering the battlefield. And that, phreaky phriends, is not an option. Sunday 1500 Marillac Auditorium Human Augmentation: Hacking Human Perception and Performance With Technology: Benefits and Dangers Lucas Potter, Xavier Palmer, Vivekanand Pandey Vimal Human augmentation is the idea of using technology to hack, alter, and enhance human perception and performance. Imagine being able to enhance your ability to navigate by sensing the flow of magnetic fields like a pigeon. Many industries are starting to explore human augmentation, such as space (enhancing astronauts), medical (rehabilitation), entertainment (greater immersion), military (greater performance), among others. In the first presentation, Dr. Vimal will begin by providing an overview of psychology and neuroscience research on the topics of human augmentation. Then he will share his own NASA-funded research on using sensory augmentation as a countermeasure for spatial disorientation. What dangers could arise from building a bridge between human and sensory augmentation devices that have the capability of altering human perception? This question will connect to the second presentation of the panel, where Dr. Palmer and Dr. Potter will explore how human augmentation connects to security through biocybersecurity followed by Q&A. Friday 1600 Little Theatre ICEBlock and the Age of Digital Activism Joshua Aaron Learn how ICEBlock has empowered over a million users nationwide to report immigration and customs enforcement activities anonymously, despite government pushback. Discover how you can use your tech skills to drive change and advocate for causes you believe in. Plus, stick around for a Q&A session where you can interact directly with the creator! This talk will be remote due to the targeting of the speaker by the current administration. Sunday 1600 Marillac Auditorium (2 hours!) Into the Fediverse Evan Prodromou One third of Americans say that social media has negatively impacted their mental health. Almost two thirds say that social media has been bad for democracy. But the majority of us still use social media on a daily basis. We clearly need better social media - enabling user choice or even platforms built and run by the users. The Fediverse is a coalition of social networking platforms that connect together, letting users interact across platforms while maintaining their independence. Evan is one of the authors of the ActivityPub standard that drives the Fediverse. He will discuss how the Fediverse went from a dream to a reality, and how individuals and communities can start exercising control over their own social platforms. Friday 1400 Little Theatre Invisible Ink of Compression XlogicX When you pop the hood of RFC 1951 (DEFLATE), there lies an interesting playground that would be otherwise unseen in the context of compression use cases. This talk will address many aspects of the ubiquitous DEFLATE compression, none of which involve compressing data! "Designer Compression" scenarios will be explored, such as blocks of DEFLATE data that can be fully ASCII printable, contain no data, buffer underflow access of nulls, and even apply forms of recursion. We will also see forensic data extraction from compressed fragments, employ difficult to detect watermarking, demo a covert channel PoC (deflate in http), and forever-cookies. The presentation style will take a high-level first pass and then dig into the technical details with the time left. Saturday 1500 Tobin 201/202 Itinerant Signal Institute (Rite of Spring) Amelia Marzec "Itinerant Signal Institute" is a project that leverages open source technology to examine and communicate about land use. As we move into an era of potentially increasing climate migration, the project aims to create a network of sensors that test environmental toxins. It examines the effect of local emissions on global climate change, using small devices that test the air and soil. That information is then shared via a portal. Imagery for the project will include ritual costumes that mark the changing of seasons. The project began with visits to polluted locations in New York City, including Governors Island (a former military base) and Newtown Creek (one of the most toxic waterways), and working with the Urban Soils Institute to collect information for the project. Friday 1500 Tobin 201/202 Leading and Survival When TSHTF - A Lighthearted Look at the End of the World George Sandford There's a moment when you realize that yes, everything may actually be on fire. As individuals, we can collapse, or we can take action to at least increase the odds of a positive outcome. As leaders (managers, parents, friends), we have to hold it together, fight to create safe spaces, keep our teams motivated, and somehow find time for self-care - without letting an active adversary turn us into the human equivalent of burnt toast. This talk will explore the art of leading in the midst of chaos, drawing on a punk ethos, irreverent humor, and a sprinkling of practical advice. You'll see how to preserve diversity and inclusion when everything feels like it's falling apart, how to support your team without losing your mind, and why it's okay to cry in the shower (just not every day). Saturday 1800 Little Theatre Media, Vibe Coding, and the Long Tail Lydia Laurenson What is even happening in the media now? There's a resurgence of paper magazines, and now they reach a long tail of subscribers due to the powers of the Internet. At the same time, social media platforms are downgrading in complexity and Signal chats have somehow become the new social media conversation. Everything old is new again, and it's all combining and recombining with weird emergent politics and independent vibe coders. This will be a discussion of the future of media, especially as seen within alternative cultures and the weird Internet. Friday 1300 Tobin 201/202 Meshtastic Attacktastic Dave "Heal" Schwartzberg In emergencies or off-grid scenarios, Meshtastic shines, but it can crumple when adversaries go off-script. Meshtastic is an open-source platform that allows for long-range, off-grid communication through LoRa-based mesh networks. While offering powerful tools for decentralized communication, particularly in remote areas or during emergencies, Meshtastic also introduces a set of security risks that could be exploited by adversaries. This talk explores the potential vulnerabilities within Meshtastic networks, focusing on attack vectors such as physical attacks, privacy leaks, key management, and jamming. Additionally, the effectiveness of the platform's encryption and authentication mechanisms will be analyzed, offering insights into how these systems can be compromised and how users can fend off attackers. This session will include a technical breakdown of known vulnerabilities and present both simulated and real-world examples of attacks on Meshtastic networks. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of how to defend against these threats, hardening their mesh networks against malicious actors. Whether you're a hobbyist experimenting with off-grid communications or a security professional assessing decentralized systems, this presentation will equip you with the tools and knowledge to secure your Meshtastic devices. Friday 1900 Tobin 201/202 New Journalism: Reimagining Information Networks From the Ground Up Patrick Boehler This presentation explores how communities are developing resilient information-sharing systems that outperform traditional journalism. Drawing from research on independent journalism in China, Patrick will examine how these organic networks function as advanced social technologies that challenge conventional understanding of information distribution. The talk invites the HOPE community to reimagine information infrastructure that can withstand authoritarian control, resist corporate manipulation, and genuinely serve community needs through collaborative problem-solving and the application of security expertise in distributed systems. Sunday 1300 Little Theatre Not Your Private Army: On the Trail of Cyber Ops Emma Best During the past two decades, hacktivist spaces have been infiltrated and co-opted by hostile interests, ranging from state actors to political and corporate entities and entitled oligarchs. This talk examines how these outside parties have attempted to build private cyber armies and task forces through the recruitment and exploitation of gray and black hat hackers. Special focus is given to the "Anonymous" brand, Western state actors, and the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Saturday 1500 Marillac Auditorium NymVPN: The First Real-World Decentralized Noise-Generating Mixnet for Anonymity Harry Halpin Nym is the first decentralized noise-generating mixnet to provision real-world network anonymity to Internet users even against nation-state adversaries. The aim here is to supersede existing VPNs in order to fight increasingly more powerful authoritarianism and surveillance. Unlike traditional centralized VPNs that can be de-anonymized by a global passive adversary - like the NSA - based on their traffic patterns, Nym adds noise ("cover traffic") to existing Internet communications. Similar to Tor, Nym routes each packet separately over a decentralized network of servers, but unlike Tor, mixes traffic and adds noise at each hop. After being introduced at HOPE five years ago, NymVPN has now shipped. NymVPN is an easy to use app for all major operating systems that makes using the Nym network as easy as using a traditional VPN for ordinary people, with both a "fast" and "anonymous" mode. The "fast" mode features speeds comparable to centralized VPNs using the same decentralized network as the mixnet, but without mixing. Via the SDK, the Nym mixnet remains free to use by hackers to build the next generation of privacy infrastructure. Sunday 1400 Little Theatre Off-Grid Data Running in Oppressive Regimes: The Pirate Box Project (and Sneakernet!) LambdaCalculus In today's political climate in the U.S., the Internet as we know it is in danger of becoming heavily monitored, privatized, and censored. Information may only be what the corporations and government want you to see, and it may become difficult for marginalized and poor communities to have access to free information and education that the Internet provides. But by building an off-grid, mesh networked system known as the Pirate Box, it'll become a pivotal way of being the data runner your community needs. The Pirate Box is a form of Sneakernet, and this talk will give you a brief overview of both, as well as strategic tools and ways to make a Pirate Box of your own, along with projects in the spirit of the Pirate Box. Friday 2100 Tobin 201/202 Offworld Voyage: Can Training for Mars Exploration Also Address Human Adaptation to Climate Biodevastation on Earth? Scott Beibin, Elizabeth Jane Cole This talk will present the design philosophy behind Offworld Voyage, a decentralized science initiative that develops ecologically sustainable training habitats for use in simulated Mars surface exploration missions - while also solving for adaptation to extreme climate change on Earth. The Offworld Voyage M.A.R.S. Tesseract Space Analog Simulation Habitats were designed with a zero waste ethos for minimal environmental impact by inventor Scott Beibin and Michael Flood. The modular and portable structures of the habitats include: a bio-dome for cultivating organic vegan plant-based and fungi-based nutrition sources, autonomous power production, advanced waste reclamation, a science laboratory for experimentation and research, a space medicine bay, a fabrication lab for prototyping and repair, facilities for fitness and creativity as well as a kitchen and living quarters. Mission immersions incorporate a vision of the future when space has become accessible to all through the use of emerging ecologically sustainable appropriate technologies enabled by new types of egalitarian economic structures and coordination methods. Crew activities include EVA explorations in pressurized space suits outfitted with bio-sensors, 3D printed construction using regolith, utilization of open source communications tools, cooperative governance exercises and the practice of mutual aid and consensus decision-making in mission planning, problem-solving and self-sufficiency challenges in the face of extreme resource scarcity, simulated time-delayed communications, and experiments to analyze the effects of isolation on astronauts during offworld missions. The inaugural mission for the M.A.R.S. Tesseract habitats will occur in a remote desert location in late 2025. It will include the founders of the project, Scott Beibin and Elizabeth Jane Cole, who are both alumni of the Mars Desert Research Station (Mission 286) and core committee members of The Journal for Space Analog Research. Future plans for the project include the development of pressurized facilities and closed loop systems, as well as development of public goods including hardware and software for Space Analog Research and S.T.E.A.M-based educational programs. Saturday 1000 Little Theatre Packets Over Any Wire: Alternative Networking Mediums for Hackers Haxedalot Why limit yourself to Ethernet and Wi-Fi when every wire in your house can carry packets? This talk explores alternative physical networking technologies that exist but are often overlooked. From powerline networking (HomePlug AV/AV2) to MoCA over coaxial cables, the talk will dive into how these systems work, their encryption and security models, known exploits, and the inherent risks of non-switched cable mediums. Real-world applications, including whole-home audio and video distribution, network segmentation strategies, and the unexpected advantages of leveraging existing infrastructure will also be explored. You'll see how HDMI matrices, IP-based video distribution, and networked audio solutions like SonosNet can integrate seamlessly over alternative backbones. Segmentation techniques to isolate security cameras will also be covered. Expect deep technical insights, practical lessons from years of experimentation, and a fresh perspective on what's possible when you stop thinking of cables as just power or TV lines - and start treating them as network highways. Whether you're looking to expand connectivity in a complex environment or just want to push the limits of home networking, this talk will leave you with new tools, techniques, and ideas to explore. Friday 1700 Tobin 201/202 Phrack Magazine #72 - 40th Anniversary Release Party Netspooky, TMZ Celebrate 40 years of legendary hacking with Phrack Magazine! Netspooky and TMZ will be dropping a special hardcopy release of their magazine, packed with cutting-edge research, underground insights, and tributes to decades of digital rebellion. Don't miss this milestone issue - crafted by the hackers for the hackers. Free, of course, as always. Grab your copy, meet the crew, and honor the zine that defined an era. The talk will explain a bit about Phrack's history, how it all started, and where it's going - the vision of the new editorial staff and how Phrack is changing. You will get a rare insight into what it takes to run an underground hacking magazine. You'll learn what it's like to work with the many authors, reading and fixing articles, dealing with obscure submissions, and what it takes to get your article accepted and become an author in Phrack. For the first time ever, a "secret challenge" has been included in the hardcopy magazine for you to find and to solve. The prize for the winner will be revealed at the talk. Saturday 1700 Marillac Auditorium Piracy Is the Past, Present, and Future of Streaming Abigail De Kosnik, Benjamin De Kosnik Official ratings of TV viewership and box office revenues for films never tell the whole story of how people access popular media texts and instead promote platforms or corporations. Many millions around the world consume media through unofficial channels, especially peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing networks. In this session, you will be introduced to alpha60, an ongoing research project with six years of TV and film distribution data that reveals trends and oddities in global media desire. The speakers will present data on the quantity, timing, and location of downloads for major television series and films, offering data on unofficial global audienceship and speculating on new insights about cultural circulation, transnational belonging, and fandom. Saturday 1700 Tobin 201/202 Planning a Project That Has No Budget Travis Southard Projects are notoriously hard for developers to manage even with project managers, budget limits, and deadlines. Often in hacking and civic tech, we are our own PMs, funders, and timekeepers, which means projects can simultaneously have no budget and unlimited budget. Since a community is not paying for a particular feature, they have no "I think we've reached where we want to stop spending" moment, so when is something done? It doesn't cost our coworkers to ask for more features, so when are they asking too much? Travis will talk about his experiences as a professional nonprofit legal aid developer and as a volunteer project lead to explore what's helped him when working with nebulous conditions around specific requirements. Sunday 1600 Tobin 201/202 The Political and AI Singularity Are Inevitable - Or Are They? Roel Schouwenberg America's transition from a literary society to one shaped by social media and AI has revolutionized how we communicate, process information, and engage politically. AI's conversational nature deepens this shift, influencing culture and cognition. This talk will explore these new realities and provide insights into how to navigate them. Sunday 1600 Little Theatre The Present and Future of Online Discourse Harper Reed Today's technologies greatly empower individuals and groups, while simultaneously creating tremendous risks to freedom and privacy. How can major forces like big tech, artificial intelligence, and political governance be guided towards pro-social outcomes? What can individuals do? Is there hope for social media to heal divisions, rather than amplify discord? These and other topics will be addressed during this lively and far-ranging presentation. Friday 1300 Marillac Auditorium Print, Build, Fly, Heal: 3D-Printed Autonomous Planes for Medical Delivery in Rural Mexico Dana Gretton, Jaguar Kristeller This talk focuses on a project with medical students in Alamos, Sonora, Mexico to develop affordable delivery drones that can get urgent medical supplies to remote communities. What currently takes days to reach by mule through mountainous terrain can hopefully be accomplished in minutes by air. This talk chronicles the evolution from off-the-shelf hobby planes to locally-built, 3D-printed aircraft capable of autonomous waypoint missions. The speakers will discuss the technical choices behind their current $1000 prototype (and how they plan to cut costs in half), alongside the organizational structure they're developing to sustain this work. Recently, they established "club guilas" with local medical students - one of whom has completed pilot training for the test aircraft. The biggest challenges faced aren't the technical ones, but rather organizational sustainability: how to transition from a project driven by visiting engineers to one owned and operated by local communities. Plans will be shared for creating a federated network of university clubs, and the blueprint for a lean nonprofit structure to support them. Sunday 1100 Little Theatre PrivacySafe and 3NWeb: Engineering User-Centric Digital Sovereignty Mikalai Birukou We want to control the technology we use, and we want to trust it. At the same time, we expect it to be convenient. 3NWeb is a groundbreaking framework that gives users full control over their digital interactions across devices, while preserving privacy and independence from centralized systems. Grounded in core principles like the principle of least authority (PoLA) and web-style federation, 3NWeb reimagines how services should operate in a user-first Internet. This presentation includes a demo of PrivacySafe, a client-side 3NWeb platform that is real, downloadable, and ready to use today. Its careful implementation raises meaningful questions from a range of perspectives: users, organizational administrators, application developers, and service providers. The session will address practical considerations and continue with in-depth conversations in the hallway track. Friday 1200 Tobin 201/202 PrivacyTests.org: Web Browser Leak Testing Arthur Edelstein PrivacyTests.org is an open source privacy audit of popular web browsers. The project subjects web browsers to automated leak tests and regularly publishes the browsers' test results head-to-head on a website and on social media. The goal of PrivacyTests is to encourage all web browsers to mend their ways and comprehensively protect everyone's privacy. By thoroughly exposing the leaks in web browsers, the website helps users choose a more private browser, and thereby puts pressure on browser makers to fix their privacy leaks. In his talk, Arthur will give some details about the project's approach to testing and presenting test results, and show how browser privacy has evolved over the past four years. Friday 1600 Tobin 201/202 Quantum Computing and AppSec: Preparing for the Post-Quantum Threat Sheshananda Reddy Kandula Quantum computing is poised to disrupt modern cybersecurity. With the potential to break widely used encryption algorithms, such as RSA and ECC, quantum threats pose a significant risk to web applications, APIs, and secure communications. This talk provides an introduction to quantum computing for application security professionals, outlines the threats to current AppSec practices, and explores how organizations can begin transitioning to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Attendees will leave with an understanding of the timeline, tools, and strategies required to prepare for the post-quantum world. Sunday 1000 Little Theatre The Quantum Curtain Ed Ryan High technology has taken on a new meaning. As AI technologies grow increasingly creepy and quantum computing catches major headlines, the U.S. government is scrambling to cover its posterior. Recognizing that these technologies pose a significant security risk, the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security has imposed export controls on AI and quantum computing technologies in an attempt to limit their spread. This talk will discuss the history of export restrictions, touching on cryptography and the Playstation 2, before moving on to explain the new restrictions and their implications for those working in impacted fields. The idea of a "deemed export," which limits who is even allowed to learn about certain technologies, will be addressed. Friday 2000 Marillac Auditorium QWK Packets and the Muffled Spark Jason Scott A deep dive into the QWK packet - a revolutionary addition to the Bulletin Board Experience of the 1980s - and the ramifications of what it represents in a very changed world. Friday 1800 Marillac Auditorium RDP Spray and Pray: Research on Modern RDP Attacks From Spray to Exploit Tess Mishoe RDP has been around the block for a while. Since 1998, admins shudder at the mere mention of port 3389. It's anything but old-hat, though - even today, there are a lot of active attack methods and adaptations for the modern world. This talk will be going through the world of RDP attacks from the perspective of an attacker, a defender, and us - the researchers and engineers. Some mass RDP attack data will be showcased, along with how to identify, label, and further prevent these attacks in the future. Sunday 1000 Tobin 201/202 A Red Team Exercise 2025, 15 Years Later Tom Brennan, Vladislav Gostomelsky, Logan Klein This presentation is about red, blue and purple teams, along with the rest of the rainbow. Dig in for a fun and interactive presentation where the panel threat models and then attacks people, process, and technology. Bring your creative thinking and defensive skills and try to stop the... hackers. Friday 1700 Little Theatre rim: Reclaiming Personal Data Sovereignty in the Age of Wearables Dana Gretton, Jaguar Kristeller As we approach a future where body-worn devices capture increasingly intimate biometrics, the question of who controls that data has never been more urgent. This talk introduces rim, a techno-social vision and set of protocols challenging the standard model of cloud-based data extraction by building tangible, person-to-person systems for storing and sharing potentially intimate live data streams, innovating at the edge of taboo to expand human connection while preserving privacy and autonomy. There will be a demonstration of early prototypes of wearable devices implementing an "SD-core" aesthetic and detailing the technical underpinnings of protocol concepts including data "dissolution" and "crystallization" with erasure coding and intermittent connection tolerance. Beyond technical implementation, the presenters will discuss how this paradigm shift creates space for entirely new forms of human-to-human connection at the boundary of what's technically possible and socially acceptable. Saturday 1100 Little Theatre The Shape of the Legal Battlefield for InfoSec Professionals at Work Ken Vedaa It is no secret that sometimes there can be tension between InfoSec professionals and the organizations that they work for. Security professionals spend their days (and sometimes nights and weekends as well) buried in the dirty laundry that others pretend does not exist. These tensions can bubble up in unexpected ways. As an InfoSec professional, what are the common legal concerns that you need to be aware of at work? How do these challenges change over time? What should you keep in mind when considering a new job? Sunday 1200 Tobin 201/202 A Sleuth's Stories on Detecting and Revealing Large-Scale Research Fraud Mu Yang In this talk, the speaker will share how they stumbled into this work by accident and what it's like to operate as a scientific sleuth within academia. The bulk of the presentation will focus on real-world cases of research fraud and misconduct, spanning fields from neurodegenerative diseases to chemistry, physics, and materials science. The talk will, through these examples, explore: the techniques and tools used to detect irregularities; how issues are reported to journals and publishers; the distinction between honest mistakes and deliberate manipulation; the collateral damage caused by misconduct, including its impact on public trust in science. The final section will examine the social and economic drivers of research fraud - and outline the systemic changes needed, globally, to break this cycle and restore integrity in science. Friday 1200 Little Theatre Small Budget, Big Protection: Cyber Defense for SMBs Robert Wagner Small businesses often face significant challenges in defending their organizations with limited budgets. This talk will provide valuable insights into budget-friendly approaches to long-standing cybersecurity issues, helping small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) improve their security posture without excessive costs. Attendees will learn how to navigate the delicate balance between driving digital innovation and managing the risks of cyber threats and data breaches. Obstacles that prevent smaller companies from accessing affordable security resources will be explored along with practical solutions to overcome these hurdles. Many smaller organizations make the mistake of focusing solely on technology to solve their security problems, neglecting crucial aspects like people and processes. This talk will emphasize the importance of a holistic approach to cybersecurity, sharing strategies that larger companies have learned over decades. By understanding and implementing these strategies, SMBs can avoid common pitfalls and effectively raise their security standards. Attendees will leave with actionable tips on improving their cybersecurity practices within a limited budget, ultimately enhancing their overall defense capabilities. Friday 1500 Little Theatre Solving My Identity Crisis Dr. Phill Hallam-Baker Traditionally, Internet accounts are controlled by the service providing them. There is no 'number portability' for email addresses. Switching costs discourage service changes. Recently, Bluesky has disrupted this model and 32 million users now use account names based on the Internet identity infrastructure, DNS - names that users can register and control directly through DNS handle providers. This presentation will describe three standards proposals extending this approach. @nywhere extends the authentication approach to allow DNS handle accounts to be used at any Internet resource, not just those running ATprotocol. @nyone combines the DNS handle approach with JSContact to provide account portability and secure exchange of credentials for end-to-end secure communication. @nything allows network connected devices to become true Internet things with an Internet DNS name, WebPKI credentials, and using @nywhere and @nyone to support access control. Saturday 1800 Marillac Auditorium Spooky Action at a Discount: DIY Meshtastic Nodes Kody Kinzie To anyone interested in off-grid communication at a low cost, Meshtastic allows even beginners to communicate with (or control) devices from miles away. Thanks to applications in emergency communication, sensor monitoring, and censor-proof encrypted chat, Meshtastic is exploding in popularity even as the cost for making nodes is going down. This talk will cover the basics of Meshtastic, setting up and customizing nodes, plus outlining the tips and tricks to building affordable custom Meshtastic nodes, learned from building custom Nibble Meshtastic nodes for the conference. Attacks against Meshtastic and issues observed in the wild will also be covered. Expect to learn about LoRa, Meshtastic node and antenna options, how to deploy nodes for specific applications, attacks against Meshtastic, and how to join larger mesh networks in your local area! Friday 1100 Little Theatre StickTock.com: An Open-Source Alternative in the Age of Digital Protectionism Sean O'Brien The threatened U.S. ban on TikTok represents a turning point in global digital policy, reflecting the rise of "data tariffs" - restrictions on the movement of information modeled after traditional trade barriers. While concerns over privacy and national security have fueled the decision, the move also aligns with economic protectionism that benefits domestic tech giants. The fallout from this policy shift could further fragment the global Internet, leading to retaliatory restrictions against American firms and diminishing access to diverse digital platforms worldwide. In response, privacy advocates and open-source developers have taken action. StickTock.com is a free and open-source frontend for TikTok, designed to allow users to access and share TikTok content without invasive tracking, advertisements, or the need for a proprietary app. Built by the team at PrivacySafe, StickTock.com is hosted in Iceland - a jurisdiction with strong commitments to Internet freedom and privacy. Their mission is to demonstrate that digital independence and free speech can thrive in the face of restrictive policies. This talk will delve into the development of StickTock.com as a case study in open-source innovation as a means of circumventing censorship and preserving privacy. The challenges of building privacy-first digital alternatives, the broader implications of government-imposed digital barriers, and the future of decentralized platforms will be explored. In an era where the free flow of information is increasingly under threat, open-source solutions offer a critical pathway toward digital resilience and user autonomy. Saturday 1000 Marillac Auditorium The Struggle for Connection in a Fragmented World: Rebuilding Third Spaces Jack Gangi Third spaces - those vital, informal gathering places between home and work - have long been central to hacker culture, but they're vanishing. This talk will explore why third spaces matter more than ever for connection, creativity, and counterculture, and how we can rebuild them in a world increasingly fragmented by gentrification, digital monopolies, and social isolation. From hackerspaces to IRC to local meetups, Jack will trace our roots and offer ideas for rekindling authentic community, both online and off. Sunday 1700 Tobin 201/202 Systems of Dehumanization: The Digital Frontlines of the War Against Bodily Autonomy Daly Barnett This presentation covers the years of security research and surveillance investigations that Daly (a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation) has done on the various threats facing movements for bodily autonomy. She covers the bad Internet bills that made sex work more dangerous, the ongoing struggle for abortion access in America, and the persecution of trans people across all spectrums of life. These issue-spaces are deeply connected, and the digital threats they face are uniquely dangerous. Come to learn about these threat models, as well as the cross-movement strategies being built for collective liberation against an authoritarian surveillance state. Saturday 1500 Little Theatre Things You Wish You Knew About Software Testing Dan Nagle Everybody agrees that software testing is important, but how does one actually go about accomplishing this efficiently? Here is a presentation about testing that has actual examples, immediate tools that can be used, and some really interesting and unexpected ways that code can break. This is a fast moving presentation discussing techniques in a way that both coders and non-coders can learn. Saturday 1000 Tobin 201/202 Tips on Living Life in Interesting Times Mitch Altman What motivates us to do what we do? How do we find meaning in doing it? What makes us choose what we choose? Can we do better? What is important? Can we thrive and feel excellent, regardless of particular outcomes? These questions may now be more pressing than ever in our most interesting of times. Throughout our lives we tend to go with the flow of what is happening, making choices by default. Where do those choices come from? In the face of the rapidly changing and challenging times that we live in, personal and political, social and economic, can we find motivation to do what we do? Can we actually improve anything? Can we find and maintain enthusiasm to move forward into the unknown and feel good about our choices, regardless of outcome? Mitch will draw from lessons learned (and re-learned), doing his best to face the challenges while often haphazardly wandering through his 68 years on the planet. This talk will attempt to address these existential, important questions that we all face (whether consciously or not). Friday 2100 Marillac Auditorium Top Ten: Democratic Open Source Software Defined Radio and Amateur Radio Applications That Matter Today Steve Bossert A major benefit of the widely used open source Git platform is every project is voted on by its followers, making selection easy for what is the most popular and worth paying attention to. This presentation focuses on the top voted applications focused around software defined radio, as well as amateur "ham" radio. Time only permits the top ten to be covered. This is a great way to showcase how diverse these two crossover topic areas have become in recent years. Some projects are purely software-based while others are a mix of open source hardware plus software. High level coverage of these amazing projects will be included, but will be explored in more depth as part of a separate hands-on workshop during HOPE_16, making this presentation a must attend for anyone interested in radio-related topics! Saturday 1200 Tobin 201/202 The Trials and Tribulations of Building Your Own Phone Wesley Appler (aka lamemakes) Over the last two decades digital surveillance has become baked into our daily lives. Your current and past location, who you're in contact with, habits/interests, sensor data, and a trove of other personal information is constantly being sent to third parties by the smartphone that is nearly always carried on us. What would it look like if we reconsidered the mobile phone entirely, putting extra emphasis on privacy and intentional disconnection via open source hardware and software? This talk will follow Wesley's journey to do just that, starting at the conception of the idea, getting acquainted with mobile networks/operators, obtaining proprietary datasheets, designing hardware, failed/successful prototypes, the current state of the project (along with demos), and how any interested parties can get involved. Sunday 1100 Tobin 201/202 Turning Leaks Into Leads With OCCRP Aleph Ezana Ceman, Klil Eden You've got a leak, a name, or a suspicious company. What's your next move? In a world where corruption thrives in the shadows, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) provides the infrastructure to bring truth to light. At the core is Aleph, a powerful data platform built to help investigators follow the money and uncover complex networks across diverse sources. Bring your own data or explore the presenters' - the OCCRP data team collects and curates four billion records from nearly 200 countries, ranging from corporate registries and sanctions lists to court filings and leaked documents. This session will walk through how Aleph powers live investigations, transforming raw, chaotic data into structured insights that expose the actors and assets behind fraud and abuse of power. Designed by journalists, researchers, and developers on the frontlines, Aleph is more than a tool - it's a global community working together to uncover the truth. What will you find? Friday 1800 Little Theatre Unearthing Air Todd Whitney Breathing polluted air is an unfortunately common human experience. Yet even as particulate matter settles in our lungs and occupies our minds more than ever, most of us lack the words and abilities to create better breathing environments. This talk will invite the HOPE community to develop personal and proactive approaches to the air we breathe by bringing it down to earth. Air is invisible, but very material and personal. This talk demonstrates hacking opportunities in the tools we traditionally use to sense, measure, and make air make sense. The presenter will dive into communication tools like the air quality index, open source sensors, and the emerging ethics of community air quality monitoring. Importantly, everyone will come away with fresh frameworks and tools they can use to begin designing their personal pollution priorities. Saturday 1300 Tobin 201/202 When the Lawman Comes Calling - Government Data Demands and Online Platforms Fred Jennings Drawing on over a decade of experience, this talk will first introduce the statutes, rules, and concepts governing law enforcement requests for user data, ranging from basic subpoenas to secret FISA search warrants. From that foundation, the discussion will cover practical steps that web services and individual users can take to reduce their legal attack surface, minimize their risks, and maximize their protection from invasive data disclosures. Saturday 2000 Marillac Auditorium Zodiac Killer Marketing: How I Used Codes, Cyphers and Nefarious Means to Launch a Covert Food Business Chef Adam Sobel During the pandemic, Adam launched Galactic MegaStallion, a new vegan food business, but decided traditional marketing was boring and morally icky. Instead, he created an elaborate system of codes, cyphers, a mysterious hotline, and strategically (and illegally) placed billboards that led curious people to find his food through coordinates. This presentation will cover how and why he developed this unconventional marketing approach, and how breaking traditional marketing rules and business conventions actually built a delighted customer base. Saturday 1700 Little Theatre HOPE_16 Closing Ceremonies Nothing lasts forever and that even applies to HOPE (the conference, not the concept). We will reminisce about what happened this weekend as if it was a decade ago. And we can guarantee there will be many fun stories to share. If you're really lucky, you'll get to help us clean up! Sunday 1800 Marillac Auditorium

Title: Wells Fargo Warns Fed Rate Cut and Additional Catalysts Could Trigger Pullback for Group of Assets – Here’s the Bank’s Outlook

Time Published: 2025-07-27T14:30:12Z
Full Content:
Banking titan Wells Fargo is unveiling a scenario that could trigger a correction for artificial intelligence (AI)-focused stocks. In a new CNBC interview, Chris Harvey, the head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, says investors are skeptical about the sustainability of stock market rallies after equities rebounded in a massive way from the April lows. Rather than a pullback, Harvey expects the stock market to consolidate as he sees the Fed cutting rates in the coming months. “A lot of people are looking for a pullback. They are talking about things being overextended. They’re talking about uncertainty with the Fed, and earnings and lions, tigers and bears, oh no. I don’t know what the short term holds. I think we could see a consolidation. It’s really unclear for me, but the underlying fundamentals: still strong. We do think the Fed will certainly have to be dovish in the next couple of months, and what we also think is that rates are going to rally because the deficit, in all likelihood, while not going to be good, will probably be better than expected based on some of the tariff news that we’re getting.” Looking at the tech sector, Harvey warns that a string of good news could hurt the AI trade. He notes that a more favorable macroeconomic landscape could stimulate risk-taking behavior and encourage investors in AI stocks to seek higher gains in other sectors. “One thing I think that could potentially hurt the AI trade is if you do get the Fed cutting, if growth is better than expected, if rates do come down, suddenly the contrarian trade starts to look better, and you could see rotation. And I think that’s the biggest fear for AI right now.” Popular AI names include Nvidia, AMD, Palantir, Microsoft, Meta and Google.

Microsoft (MSFT) is scheduled to report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell today, with Wall Street resoundingly bullish on the software giant heading into the results. All 20 analysts covering Microsoft tracked by Visible Alpha have a "buy" or equivalent rating for the stock. Their consensus price target around $580 implies 13% upside over Tuesday's close just above $512, after setting a record high Friday at $513.71. The shares have added about a fifth of their value in 2025 so far, hovering around $512 in recent trading. Wedbush, which has Microsoft on its "Best Ideas List," recently raised its price target to $600. The company "is just hitting its next phase of monetization on the AI front," Wedbush said, thanks to the adoption of Copilot, its chatbot, and the cloud-computing platform Azure. Revenue from Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure, is expected to grow 22% to $28.96 billion, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Citi analysts have called Microsoft their "top pick," giving it a price target of $613. The bank said Microsoft has pricing and margin power that is "nearly unmatched in enterprise software." Jefferies analysts issued a price target of $600 earlier this month. Analysts on average expect Microsoft to report quarterly revenue of $73.86 billion, up 14% year-over-year, and net income of $25.27 billion, or $3.38 per share, compared to $22.04 billion, or $2.95 per share, a year earlier. Wall Street will be watching for updates on Microsoft's AI spending ambitions in fiscal year 2026, which began this month. In April, CFO Amy Hood said capital expenditures are expected to grow this fiscal year, but at a slower rate than in fiscal 2025. Microsoft at the time said it expected $80 billion of capex in fiscal 2025. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) last week raised its projected 2025 capital expenditures to $85 billion from $75 billion. Rival hyperscaler Meta (META), like Microsoft, is set to report earnings after the bell today. Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) are slated to follow tomorrow. UPDATE—July 30, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent analyst estimates and share price values.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has sold 6.6 million shares worth around $1.5 billion, according to a filing with the US SEC. The sale, executed just days before Amazon's Q2 earnings release, follows a steady pattern of disposals under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Since late June, Bezos has offloaded nearly $5.7 billion in shares. He plans to sell up to 25 million more by mid-2026, while also donating millions to charity. His total share sales since 2002 now top $50 billion. (Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)
