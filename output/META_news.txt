Features The Editors | December 23, 2025 We both know the history of superlatives creates a flattened, reductive interpretation of our world. But they're also the quickest way to label a praise for those recommendations we give in order to connect with one another, and isn't that why we're here? To find something in common, to stave off the loneliness for another hour? Should you have any additions, questions, or qualms: treat yourself by commenting below. We'll be seeing you in 2026. — The Editors (Click on a name to jump to their selections) Jean Marc Ah-Sen Robert Aman Tiffany Babb Jason Bergman Colin Blanchette Kevin Brown Clark Burscough RJ Casey Henry Chamberlain Helen Chazan Michael Dooley Alex Dueben Malcy Duff Austin English Jim Falcone Andrew Farago Shaenon K. Garrity Nicole Georges Corinne Halbert Charles Hatfield Tim Hayes Bart Hulley Christopher Irving John Kelly Hank Kennedy Christina Lee Chris Mautner Sean McCarthy Tate McFadden Daniel Meyerowitz Claire Napier Brian Nicholson Isaac Odai Hagai Palevsky Leonard Pierce Richard Pound Zach Rabiroff Oliver Ristau Cynthia Rose Tom Shapira J. Webster Sharp Valerio Stivè Marc Tessier *** (articles) (top) My favorite comic releases and reissues of the year, in no particular order: *** (articles) (top) Although I firmly believe that the best comics are being produced right now — works that will only be surpassed by those yet to come— I can’t help feeling, when asked to sum up the year, that noticeably fewer comics have seen the light of day compared with last year. This impression is entirely subjective; I have no empirical data to support it. Still, it may not be wholly unreasonable given the dark clouds gathering over the comics landscape: rising tariffs, increasing production costs, Diamond’s bankruptcy, to name just a few possible factors. And if that weren’t enough, several publishers have reported serious financial losses, among them France’s L’Association, which has publicly appealed to its readers for support in order to survive. That said, the year has also delivered a number of truly outstanding works, which I have done my best to rank in the list below. An undisputed number one is Swiss cartoonist Nando von Arb’s Bouquet de peurs. This brick of an autobiographical work, dealing with von Arb’s mental illness, manages to fuse influences from Frida Kahlo, Brecht Evens, and illustrations reminiscent of Czech children’s books from the 1970s in a wholly unique way. Although mental illness is far from a new subject in comics, Bouquet de peurs is the most compelling work on the topic since David B.’s portrayal of his brother’s epilepsy from the 1990s. Anders Nilsen’s Tongues may contain one plot element too many, but few cartoonists can juggle Greek mythology, a talking chicken, soldiers, an American hitchhiker, and more with the same finesse as Nilsen. The result is a stunning reading experience, driven by powerful and often haunting imagery. Moa Romanova’s second book in English, Buff Soul, can be read as a graphic travel diary, drawing on a long tradition of documenting life on tour. Romanova follows her friend ShitKid to a music festival in Texas, and while the book includes genre-typical elements — such as the rebellious and often self-destructive tendencies of the rock music scene — its greatest strength lies in its sensitive portrayal of genuine friendship. When Jean-Christophe Menu, together with Étienne Robial, decided to revive the legendary 30/40 series, Menu was the first to contribute a volume of his own. Expectations were high, and he had no trouble living up to them. The comics dealing with his parents’ deaths rank among the finest work he has ever produced — and, by extension, among the strongest examples of autobiographical comics as a genre. World Within the World, Julie Gfrörer’s collection of short stories revisits her familiar uncanny version of our world, one filled with desire, despair, and the universal need for connection. For all their macabre qualities, the dark corners Gfrörer explores are also very funny. In sixth place, I’ve put Ville Ranta, who seems incapable of making a bad book. For over twenty years, Ranta has chronicled his life in comics. His latest work revisits the period when he was active at a Finnish cultural magazine, where he, among other things, published a comic that satirically commented on the Finnish political leadership’s response to the Muhammad cartoons controversy in Denmark—a topic he discussed in an interview with The Comics Journal. In Les buveurs de vin, the reader follows both the events themselves and their aftermath, interspersed with prodigious amounts of drinking. That Ranta remains untranslated into English becomes more baffling with every new book. New York Review Comics deserves special praise for finally translating into English another book by Yvan Alagbé, co-founder of Amok and one of the most influential publishers of the French alternative comics scene of the 1990s. The book continues Alagbé’s sustained exploration of race and colonialism in contemporary France. A younger — but equally prodigious — storyteller is Cameron Arthur, whose fanzine Swag has been a joy to follow. Stories from its early issues have now been collected into a single volume. With cartoonists like Arthur, the future of comics looks bright. *** (articles) (top) *** (articles) (top) The vast majority of my comics reading in 2025 was research for interviews on this site. Of those, I have to mention Anders Nilsen's Tongues, and the truly surprising return of Jeff Nicholson's Colonia as particularly noteworthy new books. Otherwise most of the new comics I read this year were ... fine, I guess? Not a whole lot came to mind when I sat down to look back on the year. We did get a new Love & Rockets collection from Jaime Hernandez (Life Drawing), which was excellent as always, and I also very much enjoyed Santos Sisters vol. 1 by Greg & Fake. But a lot of other books were just forgettable, if not downright disappointing. With one surprising exception, The Solitary Gourmet. There's a local Japanese restaurant my family eats at regularly, and they always play the television series based on this manga on their screens. Without subtitles, of course, forcing us to try to guess what's going on. I had dubbed the series "Inspector Food" because it looked like a show about a detective, only one where all he does is eat. I wasn't too far off, I suppose — he's not a cop, just a salesman. But anyway, the manga by Jirō Taniguchi and Masayuki Kusumi is wonderful. As noted by Joe McCulloch in his review, the book is best enjoyed in small bites, something I appreciate. It's small, it's quiet, there's no major drama to be found, it's beautifully illustrated, and it's all about food. Maybe I'm having flashbacks to all the time I spent wandering Tokyo by myself, or maybe it says something about my state of mind, but this weird book about a man eating food by himself is my favorite graphic novel of 2025. *** (articles) (top) 1) Hidden Islands by Cameron Arthur (Bubbles Zine Publications) I passed up the opportunity to buy this book a few times before I pulled the trigger, and even then, I only bought it because of the high quality of Bubble’s other publications (Stories from Zoo by Anand was a revelation), not because the book looked that interesting at first glance. I was wrong. It’s a fantastic book of short stories, and it’s the book that I’ve thought about the most since I first read it. I hope that we see a lot more work from Cameron Arthur. 2) Tales of Paranoia by R. Crumb (Fantagraphics) I was shocked when I heard that Crumb had a new comic book coming, hot on the heels of Dan Nadel’s wonderful biography. It was a pleasant shock, even though I was prepared for it to be forgettable work by a once great artist. Luckily for me (and everyone else, except his haters), he’s still a great artist, and he can still draw like a motherfucker. Even though he’s wrong about almost everything, Crumb communicates his beliefs clearly and effectively. This comic is by far the best value of the year as well. It’s a dense, satisfying read, and it’s re-readable as well. It delivers more than most graphic novels with ten times the page count. 3) Tongues Volume 1 by Anders Nilsen (Pantheon) If you’ve been reading Tongues in its serialized form, then you’re probably aware that it’s a very good comic, but reading the existing story in one go is a different matter entirely. There’s still another big book coming to finish this story off, but I think it’s safe to say at this point that it’s Nilsen’s best book so far. Considering the fact that his previous work has ranged from good to excellent, that’s no mean feat. This book is the summation of his work as a cartoonist, and it’s thrilling to witness a great cartoonist at the peak of his powers dive headlong into his own preoccupations in such a considered and mature way. 4) Cornelius: The Merry Life of a Wretched Dog by Marc Torices (Drawn & Quarterly) I knew nothing about this book or its creator before I read it. I flipped through it and looked good. When you take the time to actually look at it, though, you realize just how good it looks. The sheer craft on display is mesmerizing. Torices utilizes every kind of form and mode that he can think of to tell the story of a hapless loser meandering through his pathetic life who fails to aid one of the few people that’s ever been kind to him. The story is simple and it’s not as funny as it thinks it is, but I’ll admit I was impressed by the audacity of the storytelling, and the book overall. 5) King-Cat Comics and Stories #84 by John Porcellino (self-published) At this point, King-Cat is like the tides. It’s a natural force that seems inevitable, and you know the form will be familiar. The content is never the same, even if the preoccupations are. Love, death, music, groundhog sightings … they’re all here, as usual. At this point, Porcellino is an institution, of a kind; and like a lot of institutions, he’s taken for granted. He shouldn’t be. I’m grateful for each new issue of King-Cat and I hope he makes them for years to come. 6) The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco (Metropolitan Books) Measured against Joe Sacco’s other books, this is a fairly minor work. Of course, a minor work by Sacco is better than most cartoonists could ever hope for. India is vast, both in terms of its geography and its history, and this relatively thin book only scraped the surface of the corruption, sectarianism, and bloodletting that has plagued the country’s modern history. The book is beautifully drawn and Sacco packs a lot into these pages, but for the first time when reading one of his books I felt like maybe he had bitten off more than he could chew. As always, I’m glad he took the bite, especially since no one else seems likely to follow in his footsteps and make harrowing books like he has, over and over again. 7) Love Languages by James Albon (Top Shelf Productions) Each of Albon’s books is different from the last. I’ve liked all of them. This book walked a tightrope, though instead of falling into the abyss, the danger was that it would fall into cloying sentimentality. That’s not a fate worse than death, mind you, but when the story is a romance that risk is high to begin with. The romance in this story is well-earned, even if it isn’t revelatory. Albon’s storytelling is, however. I’ve never seen a comic handle multiple spoken languages as skillfully as he does here, blending English, French, and Mandarin together, artfully. It’s a beautiful comic by an underrated cartoonist. 8) The Ephemerata: Shaping the Exquisite Nature of Grief by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics) I don’t know what I expected this book to be, but it was different than whatever I expected. I knew that the drawing would be great, and it is. There are times when you come across a page that’s so unbelievably gorgeous it just stops you in your tracks. Tyler’s exploration of her grief, and grief in general, gets exhausting after a while, but I think that’s the point. Over the course of 200+ dense, lushly illustrated pages she digs into one of the hardest experiences life has to offer, and from that pain she creates beauty. It’s a book that will sit with you. 9) Night Drive by Richard Sala (Fantagraphics) Richard Sala has been one of my favorite cartoonists for a very, very long time. This book, originally printed in a magazine format forty years ago, has eluded me, so imagine my surprise, and pleasure, when I heard that it was being printed in a luxurious hardcover edition. This early work is a lot of fun. All of Sala’s work was fun, though the way it was fun varied greatly over the years. For anyone who fondly remembers his Invisible Hands segments from MTV’s Liquid Television, I would imagine they would enjoy this work. For me, it was the missing piece of a puzzle I’ve been putting together for a few decades and, happily, a wonderful comic from beloved cartoonist. 10) Ginseng Roots: A Memoir by Craig Thompson (Pantheon) What this book is, is impressive. Making a book this long is impressive (440+ pages) but it’s not uncommon nowadays. What is uncommon is how much cartooning went into every single page. Thompson lavishes those pages with a lot of ink, and a lot of stories, too. It’s subtitled “A Memoir” and it is one, but it also delves into the history of his family, his community, ginseng farming (in China and North America), and where they all are at today. The ambition of this book impressed me, and it delivered on that ambition. *** (articles) (top) Absolute Batman Vol. 1: The Zoo by Scott Snyder, Nick Dragotta, and Frank Martin DC’s Absolute series reimagines well-known heroes without their well-known back stories. This Bruce Wayne grows up lower- to middle-class, so he lacks the financial resources of the traditional story, leaving him to rely even more on his mental abilities. Gotham is the same place, though, overrun by crime bosses and a group called the Party Animals who seek to sow chaos. The strongest part of this work is that the focus remains solely on Batman’s desire to do good in the world, to seek justice for everybody, which has always been at his core. You Must Take Part in Revolution by Badiucao and Melissa Chan Badiucao and Chan don’t provide a neat ending to their work, as there aren’t easy answers for how and when one should act against a tyrannical government. However, they’re clear that inaction isn’t a viable option. Spent by Alison Bechdel It seems obvious to mention Alison Bechdel when talking about great work from the year, but she’s taken a bit of a risk here by returning to fiction after her past three memoirs. While she certainly focuses on friends and community, as she did in Dykes to Watch Out For, her exploration of how we spend our time or money or energy seems particularly relevant today. She even ends with a brief glimmer of hope in community, something we could certainly use right now. Muybridge by Guy Delisle Delisle goes well beyond Muybridge’s famous photograph of a horse to create the world of invention that he was a part of. Most interestingly, Delisle shows Muybridge’s influence on animation, motion pictures, and graphic works like Delisle’s, an influence that continues well beyond what Muybridge could imagine. Absolute Wonder Woman, vol. 1: The Last Amazon by Kelly Thompson, Hayden Sherman, Mattia de Iulis, and Dustin Nguyen Here, Diana doesn’t grow up on Themyscira. Instead, she’s raised in the underworld. Rather than preventing her from caring about and fighting for humanity, that banishment simply gave her more weapons to fight for justice. Nightwing: On with the Show by Dan Watters, Dexter Soy, Veronica Gandini, and Wes Abbott Dan Watters and team take on the challenge of picking up Nightwing’s story after the amazing run led by Tom Taylor. They draw on Nightwing’s past experiences with the circus and his early days with Batman, while throwing him in the middle of a gang war that has begun after Blockbuster’s death in the earlier series. *** (articles) (top) Well, I don’t know about you, but 2025 sure had a lot of “Lemon, it’s Wednesday” vibes to it for me, so, much like last year, a list compiled in a bedraggled state, running to the lecture hall with a slice of toast in my mouth, but a list nonetheless, from your friendly neighbourhood linkblogger. While the lion’s share of the pop culture outlet coverage seemed to go to the title with the steroidally embiggened versions of Gotham’s denizens, for this regular-sized reader the most interesting of DC Comics’ Absolute line have absolutely been Absolute Wonder Woman by Kelly Thompson, Hayden Sherman, et al. and Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp, Javier Rodriguez, et al., the first volumes for both of which mess with their respective mythoi in interestingly spiky ways, and don’t mind assuming that the reader will be able to keep pace and catch up when dropped in media res, and both of which also have some of the most pleasingly arresting visuals I’ve seen in a superhero comic for a while. Now, as long as they don’t tank the ongoing supracontinuity fun with plodding crossover events that kill an entire line’s momentum, we’ll be laughing. Taking the coveted top spot for comic that made me say “oh, mate, brutal” out loud the most times while reading it this year, we have The Sickness, Volume 1 by Lonnie Nadler, Jenna Cha, et al., the timeline hopping nastiness of which put me in mind of the creeping descent into madness and unmooring from reality as depicted in Providence by Alan Moore and Jacen Burrows. The slow burn reveals and peeling back of the consistently unnerving story playing out in the first collected volume for the series has left me strongly anticipating that volume two will also be a future best-of contender. Cleansing the palate after the nastiness [complimentary] of the last pick, comes the warmhearted delights of Miss Ruki by Fumiko Takano, translated by Alexa Frank, which was yet another annual pick cribbed from Sally Madden and Katie Skelly’s aces Thick Lines podcast, and which was a much needed dose of a slice-of-life strip that’s just consistently Really Nice and Properly Funny. The closing narrative coda, returning to best friend protagonists Miss Ruki and Ecchan ten years down the line, is genuinely lovely. As a classic dyed-in-the-wool trade-waiter, I was very glad to see The Santos Sisters by Greg & Fake receive a winningly handsome collected edition (peep that see-thru acetate dust jacket and thick paper stock) this year, which serves well the nod and a wink punchlines to dirty jokes with clean lines to be found within. This book sings as this year’s shining example that, sometimes, like Dandadan in last year's list, all you really need, to pep you up during a grim period in history, is a comic that’s horny and weird and fun and good to look at in equal measure. *** (articles) (top) Alive Outside, ed. by Cullen Beckhorn and Marc Bell (Neoglyphic Media).

Thank you to all the artists listed below. (If I have written about any of these books in my “Arrivals and Departures” column this year, I will include a link.) Honorable Mentions (in no order): Milk White Steed by Michael D. Kennedy Tedward by Josh Pettinger Prop Comic by Veronica Graham Animal Denial by Emilie Gleason K is in Trouble Again by Gary Clement Them Shaped Clouds by Max Huffman The Shifting Ground Vol. 1 by Joe Walsh Laser Eye Surgery by Walker Tate The Past is a Grotesque Animal by Tommi Parrish Slick Susan and the Mysterious Soup by Rebecca Kirby The Weight by Melissa Mendes “Kristof” by Alex Schubert Igor the Assistant by Haus of Decline Top 10 of 2025 (in order!): 10.) Allee Errico’s pages in Bernadette #2 9.) Pleasure Beach #1 by Josh Pettinger 8.) Terminal Exposure by Michael McMillan 7.) Flea by Mara Ramirez 6.) Christine by Cyril Vilks 5.) Valley Valley/Idella Dell by Audra Stang 4.) Precious Rubbish by Kayla E. 3.) Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers 2.) Dogtangle by Max Huffman 1.) River Rangers #8 by Henry McCausland *** (articles) (top) We began 2025 with a big event title, the first volume of Tongues, by Anders Nilsen, and we end the year with another career milestone, Ephemerata by Carol Tyler. Both books are equally captivating in their own ways and speak to the care and dedication of their respective creators. Both books are multi-layered, push the limits of the medium and maintain the traditional structures in beautiful ways. Other titles in 2025 doing the same at an exemplary level are Insectopolis by Peter Kuper, the collected Gingseng Roots by Craig Thompson, The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco, Milk White Steed by Michael D. Kennedy, Photographic Memory by Bill Griffith and The New York Trilogy, featuring Paul Karasik as editor and contributor. There’s always more to add to a list and it depends upon the focus, among other things. Perhaps it can be dependent upon a cool factor—but we can’t all be cool kids, right? A list of what gets excluded is as intriguing as what gets included. Anyway, I suppose you can honestly get tripped up in terms of what best represents any given year. One thing to keep in mind is that any art form, particularly comics, is years in the making and various versions of it might come out at various years until you get the definitive version. You also have the heavy hitters, the giants in the industry, right alongside newcomers. If you think it’s easy for me and my friend and colleague Paul Buhle to sift through the onslaught on titles each year and review them at Comics Grinder, then you’ve got a screw loose. At the end of the day, it’s those big-name comics artists, out there leading the way, who are hopefully keeping us all honest. They’re there to set an example and are supposed to tell us we’re all in this together. With that in mind, I add to this list, in no particular order, notable cartoonists making notable work: Introverts Illustrated by Scott Finch, available thru Partners & Sons. This Slavery by Scarlett & Sophie Rickard, published by SelfMadeHero The Poet Volumes 1 & 2 by Todd Webb (self-published). Molly and the Bear by Bob and Vicki Scott, published by Simon & Schuster. Wally Mammoth: The Sled Race by Corey R. Tabor & Dalton Webb, published by HarperCollins. Tedward by Josh Pettinger, published by Fantagraphics. You and Me on Repeat by Mary Shyne, published by Henry Holt. The Horrors of Being a Human by Desmond Reed, published by Microcosm Publishing. Tuck Everlasting: The Graphic Novel by K. Woodman-Maynard, published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux. This Beautiful Ridiculous City by Kay Sohini, published by Ten Speed Press. Raised by Ghosts by Briana Loewinsohn, published by Fantagraphics. Tales of Paranoia by R. Crumb, published by Fantagraphics. Raymond Chandler’s Trouble is My Business by Arvind Ethan David & Ilias Kyriazis, published by Pantheon. The King’s Warrior by Huahua Zhu, published by Bulgilhan Press. *** (articles)(top) I hate writing best-of lists. Even with the caveat of “favorite” over “best,” I feel these lists are often a testament to what I have not read and what I have overlooked far more than what I love. Nonetheless, I persist with these damn things, because telling people what comics I love is something I was put on this earth to do. Perhaps this is weakness, but nothing has made me gladder as a critic than the kind words from readers and artists alike that I've gotten over the years. I'll go on. (lol) 2025 was a bad year for human rights but arguably a good year for comics. A great argument in favor of it being a good year for comics is that I published a few. An even better argument is that we got the collected Dogtangle this year. My favorite comics are formally ambitious, ranging from literary work to literal pornography, all tied together by a persistent excitement for the medium they live in. I've listed out a few: Dogtangle by Max Huffman, Fantagraphics 2025 is the year of Dogtangle. Social satire that collapses in on itself. Cartoon humor that verges on formlessness. A love story, perhaps. A very big dog. I should have more words about Dogtangle, but how can I sum up this mass of mutts? It speaks for itself, or, perhaps, barks. A Garden of Spheres Vol. 1 by Linnea Sterte, Peow2 A vast, beautiful, curious book that demands revisitation. Wide open vistas for the eyes to drink. What Happened After My Place Got So Humid It Grew Magic Mushrooms and I Ate Them and Got Super Horny by Karasu Chan, J18 I am dead serious, one of my favorite comics this year was this ero-manga with that title. Visually inventive and deeply funny pornography about a woman's delusional quest to make a real friend, bolstered by energetic mark-making and impeccable comedic timing. Likely the comic I have recommended to people in conversation the most this year, tied with the majesterial Dogtangle (usually brought up in different company, mind you ... Usually.). Unsinkable Ship of Fools by Jonas Goonface, Iron Circus Remaining on the subject of pornography (and we must!), nobody draws people fucking right now quite like Jonas Goonface. Ship of Fools is a brilliant work of folklore-by-way-of-sex-farce full of color and weight that should embarrass all other action cartoonists of any variety. Deep erotica that you will return to. Aneido's Anthology 1: The Soul-Selling Corporate Drone & Other Fanciful Tales by Aneido, Red String Translations Recency bias may be speaking here (I just read this one), but after trudging through a fair bit of yuri this year, green or otherwise, Aneido is the artist whose work has captivated me the most overall and this collection is my favorite yet. Their line is soft and pleasant, their stories hang dreamlike in a space between wish fulfillment and something more otherworldly. A reminder that queer comics and alternative comics share the same urge at their root, to do something better than the mainstream. Idella Dell and Valley Valley by Audra Stang, Self published There are a lot of comics I read on social media this year and some of them were even very good. Audra Stang is doing something else, the freshest comics-on-comics thing to come along in a long time. Stang loves her characters, and beats them over and over with deeply familiar grief and rage. Both of these women suck and I am rooting for them. Szarlotka by Jas Hice, Frog Farm A small, fucked up story, one of the most beautiful two-tone riso print jobs I've seen in a long time, a novella of a zine that cements Hice as an artist to watch. I can't get enough of the Hichcockian vice of voyeur and victim in this one. Troubling! SF “Shorts Folio” Serialized Fragments of Supplementary Files #1 by Ryan Cecil Smith, self-published Speaking of amazing riso printing, this comic is probably my favorite book as an aesthetic object this year. These colors, wow! It's been a while since Smith's cast of adventurers last graced spinner racks, and they are truly a sight for sore eyes. You simply have to love a comic about a mailman in space. Round World Thinking by Ana Woulfe, Reptile House Another beautiful riso artifact, that stands beside Dogtangle as a gag comic that is a universe unto itself, a liberatory trans-femme project in the Gendertrash tradition that gets into the weeds with plants and isn't afriad to let out a cackle. More comics like this forever! In brief, I will also mention a few of my favorite reprints and localizations of “classics” from this year: More ink will be spilled on these by yours truly in due time. To take a brief dip in the conflict of interest reservoir, most of my favorite zines this year were by the Hamilton-based cartoonist Zoot, who I have published in my anthology comic Afternoon Affair and who tabled next to my press at Expozine in Montreal. Bias disclosed, nobody is doing it like them. Highlights this year included the informative How To Get Bit By A Werewolf, the furry dyke drama Butch Bait (published by the gods at Diskette Press), and the truly miraculous BL boner pill crack ship The Hardest Day Of My Life. Read those if you get a chance, and you'll understand why I couldn't not mention them. And on that questionable note, I bid you adieu. Hopefully 2026 is a better year for everyone, and a lot of comics are good as well. *** (articles) (top) It's my second annual “Not-E*sn*r Awards by a Former Will Eisner Awards Judge (2020)," where I'll again bypass the nomination process and declare category winners based on my own "Best of the Year" opinions. Any relation between other, official Awards and mine is purely comical.1 Ice Cream Man #43: One-Page Horror Stories by W. Maxwell Prince, Martin Morazzo, Zoe Thorogood, Grant Morrison, Matt Fraction, Kelly Sue DeConnick, Geoff Johns, Matt Fraction, Patton Oswalt, Jeff Lemire, etc. (Image) ~ Best Single Issue/One-Shot You needn’t be familiar with Ice Cream Man and co-creators Prince and Morazzo’s bold, ongoing structural experiments with the medium to enjoy the rich variety of flavors offered, here served in tasty, single-page scoops. Prince adroitly authors multiple stories and writers like Johns, Morrison, DeConnick, and Fraction bring their own unique, terrifying sensibilities, each rendered in styles to enhance the stories, wonderfully told through a variety of narratives and formats. Among the most imaginative are a Candy Land-ish board game, a Gustav Doré-styled descent into Hell, and, most frighteningly: a New York Times front page. Creepy. And yummy. Monkey Meat: The Summer Batch by Juni Ba (Image) ~ Best Limited Series With stylized art reminiscent of Michael T. Gilbert, Monkey Meat immerses you in its hilarious, energetic asphalt-and-jungle world. Inside the Monkey Meat Company, feces are flung at capitalism, gods, tourism, the military, colonization, and even piloted robots. To emphasize his themes, Ba makes full use of his medium with such devices as selective coloring and frequent, intense, in-your-hairy-face splash pages. These absurd, endearing, despicable anthropomorphs have you hoping for further installments. The Seasons, Volume 1 by Rick Remender and Paul Azaceta — Best New Series and Paul Azaceta, The Seasons #1-4 (Image) ~ Best Cover Artist Seasons is a delightfully sinister adventure/horror/mystery, rendered in joyous, vibrant hues. Remender introduces us to the enchanting Season sisters, each bursting with their distinct personalities: Autumn, serious archaeologist; Summer, globe-trotting, temperamental superstar; Winter, passionate artist and mentor to the effervescent Spring, who kicks off a carnival adventure in a thrilling chase of… an envelope? Artist/co-creator Azaceta treats us to bold visuals on every page, and each of his four covers has its distinctive appeal, such as a threatening skull-clown faux-collage and a bold graphic recalling Esteban Maroto and Bob Peak’s Camelot. When you’re in the mood for fun, scary adventure, Azaceta’s creative virtuosity bids you to welcome any time of the year. Little Batman, Month One by Morgan Evans and Jon Mikel (Penguin/Random House) — Best Publication for Kids In Little Batman, writer Evans offers smart and well-delineated answers to nagging questions such as “Why does Batman need to pose as Bruce Wayne?” from the point of view of Bruce’s son, Damian. The young Wayne wants Little Batman’s exciting life all the time — “Homework is a crime!” — but he also learns the importance of being himself. Mikel’s art, a delightful mix of Sergio Aragones and Kyle Baker, keeps things lively, with pastiches of Batman: Year One and Golden Age Batman. And his splendidly fun silent sections — drawn by “Damian” and dabbed with outside-the-lines “crayon”, courtesy of colorist Ian Herring — should inspire even the youngest future Bat-artist. This little Batman story is most enjoyable for big people as well. Daisy Goes to the Moon by Mathew Klickstein and Rick Geary (Fantagraphics) ~ Best Publication for Teens The history behind Daisy is a trip in itself. Briefly, the real Daisy Ashford (1881-1972) began amusing her family with stories beginning at age four. Eventually, J.M. Barrie (of Peter Pan renown) printed them complete with the misspellings and rambling logic of genuine childhood innocence. Here, Geary departs from his established panel format while still displaying his unmistakably endearing storytelling mastery to perfectly tell Daisy’s rocketing adventures. Young readers will delight in her lovable self-admiration, bravery, cleverness, and playful wordplay, as well as her lighthearted, endearing companions. Adults will appreciate the antiquarian science, as well as giggle at Daisy’s spirit and cheekiness. Read it together with the kids. You’ll love it to the moon and back. Emma & Capucine, Volume 1 by Jérôme Hamon and Lena Sayaphoum (TokyoPop) ~ Best International Publication for Teens In this elegant bande dessinée, the teenage Emma and her younger sister are aspiring prima ballerinas with their sights set on the prestigious Paris Opéra. Like a splendidly choreographed dance performance, Lena Sayaphoum’s art is rendered with grace, eloquence, and spirit. His soft, fluid illustration style and muted color palette hit all the right notes to intone this tender tale of discovery, growth, and familial relationships. The Art of Milt Gross Vol. 1: The Judge Magazine Comics 1923–1924 by Paul C. Tumey (independently published) ~ Best Humor Publication Humor knows no decade. Or century, for that matter. The screwball cartoons of cartoon virtuoso Gross show that the best humor is still fresh and hilarious after 100 years. This, the first in a series, presents hundreds of rare, revolutionary cartoons from Judge during the early 1920s, which formed the foundation for Nize Baby, Count Screwloose, He Done Her Wrong, and numerous other successes (for the definitive compendium, see Tumey’s Gross Exaggerations: The Meshuga Comic Strips of Milt Gross, 1926-1934, from Sunday Press). Everyone will identify with the schadenfreudenly-funny frustrations of Gross’s everyman characters who deal with life’s simplest incidents that hilariously snowball from bad to worse to worser to worsest. Plus, the enlightening commentary by historian Tumey adds insight and depth, noting how Gross often reworked his gags, basically stealing from and improving upon himself. With the master of cartoon pantomime, words can’t fully express our enjoyment. And that’s no Banana Oil. Cornelius: The Merry Life of a Wretched Dog by Marc Torices (Drawn & Quarterly) — Best European Humor Publication Never mind the Marvel and DC Universes. The best way to enjoy – and challenge – yourself this year is to tumble into the anarchic, delightfully absurd Cornelius Universe. At nearly 400 pages, Spanish artist Torices gleefully explores the entirety of the comics medium through deliriously shifting eras and spaces, which he renders in a madcap array of styles and textures. Cornelius gleefully homages and vastly expands upon everything from Frank King’s Gasoline Alley to European bandes dessinée. And humor knows no boundaries: as proven here, it can be both merry and wretched, hilarious and unsettling. It’s also a celebration of the art of comics, skillfully pushing the very boundaries of the medium. Rich with multiple interpretations, Cornelius generously rewards repeated re-readings. Drawn to MoMA: Comics Inspired by Modern Art by Jon Allen, Gabrielle Bell, Barbara Brandon-Croft, Roz Chast, Liana Finck, Ben Passmore, Walter Scott, Chris Ware, others. (MoMA) — Best Anthology Beginning in 2019, the Museum of Modern Art commissioned an array of comics creators with diverse styles and sensibilities to create new strips, using visits to MoMA as their inspiration. And this book rewards us with fresh, thoughtful short stories offering a variety of approaches – literal and internal – and perspectives – sometimes playful, often poignant – from talents such as Roz Chast, Gabrielle Bell, Ben Passmore, and Liana Finck. Each, in their way, offer insights on the many diverse modes of art appreciation: aesthetic, social, personal, etc. Truly praiseworthy is the book’s ability to inspire and incentivize readers to experience and engage with gallery works as well, and bring back their own stories. Oh, and did I mention that the book also comes with a tall, spectacular Chris Ware fold-out poster, suitable for homes and galleries alike? The Novel Life of Jane Austen: A Graphic Biography by Janine Barchas & Isabel Greenberg (Black Dog & Leventhal/Greenfinch) ~ Best Reality-Based Work Whether or not you’re an Austenite, you’ll find this book as an elegant, captivating study. Barchas’s astute and affectionate devotion to Austen plays out on every page. And Greenberg’s delicate art and soft color palette affords the reader a captivating tour of 18th century London society and a fascinating glimpse into the Pride & Prejudice author’s life from young lady with nascent writing skills to struggling scribe to acclaimed novelist. Projections of Austen’s inspirations for her fictional scenes and character are well defined via her family’s heartbreaking economic and literary struggles. As she comes to realize that she’s “never alone”, we can all be rewarded by so positive a view of life. (Incidentally, Austen’s 250th birthday was just celebrated on Dec. 16) Precious Rubbish by Kayla E. (Fantagraphics) ~ Best Graphic Album–New Visually striking and contextually disturbing, this book is ultimately cathartic. Daringly designed with vignettes, ads, and games – Kayla E.’s remarkable tribute to the versatility of the medium – it bluntly explores the author/artist’s life as she endures abuse, emotional and physical, and mostly from her sadistic mother. Her simple, almost cutout-like art is unquestionably moving, capturing her heartbreak and growth. And its bright, vivid colors – especially the shocking red – are intensely penetrating in every unsettling scenario. There’s a creepy familiarity to the surroundings, which a check of the end notes reveals to be true: many pages are inspired by the more wholesome, sanitized 1950s comics like Archie and Little Dot. If you can handle the emotional excursion, you may find some precious hope amidst the rubbish. Paul Auster's The New York Trilogy by Paul Karasik, David Mazzucchelli, Lorenzo Mattotti (Pantheon Graphic Library) — Best Adaptation from Another Medium City of Glass was revolutionary when it was first published back in 1995 – as an exceptionally well-done collaboration between Karasik and extraordinary artist Mazzucchelli – and the term “graphic novel” was relatively unknown. And on its own it’s justifiably considered a masterpiece, due in no small part to Karasik’s influence from Harvey Kurtzman, who he had as an SVA teacher, and Art Spiegelman, who he apprenticed for on Raw. And now we have all three of Auster’s brilliantly interwoven postmodern existential pulp detective stories in graphic novel form, with Mattotti’s art acting as center-story transition in illustrated novel and Karasik himself skillfully providing full-circle closure. These stories are essentially about writing – words – which Karasik and his two sterling collaborators have transformed into stories about words and images, so skillfully structured as to become most valuable as tutorials on communicating complex, intricate narratives – of loss, obsession, even meaninglessness – through creative, evocative visual storytelling. The Red Badge of Courage by Steven Crane, adapted by Steve Cuzor (Abrams) ~ Best International Adaptation from Another Medium Sorry, kids: Cuzor won’t help you write your book report. Instead, he’s given us one of the most powerfully illustrated adaptations of a book you may ever read or see, capturing Crane’s emotional shock of combat as if Civil War photographer Matthew Brady was reporting on that very battlefield. This is an excellent, primal condemnation of soldiers’ terror of dying, of cowardice, and of the damned depersonalization of men reduced to nothing more than fodder. Stark yet subtle chiaroscuro drives home the story’s violent misery, enhanced by Meephe Versaevel’s nuanced coloring, rendering days with muted browns and moonlit nights with soft blues. Crane makes this story real, terrifying, and profoundly human. Muybridge by Guy Delisle and Helge Dascher (Drawn & Quarterly) — Best U.S. Edition of International Material For 25 years, Canadian cartoonist Delisle has been producing first-person graphic travelogues through Asia and the Middle East. Muybridge is something completely different, a classic American story of a ambitious immigrant coming to America, embracing innovation, then fame, rising and eventually falling. It’s a huge-scale biography of one of the greatest influences on early filmmaking, art, and comics, while reading like a Dickens novel. Delisle follows a Canadian tradition of conveying more information, more detail, with far fewer lines, and he uses this to great effect in illustrating Eadweard Muybridge's film and motion experiments while revealing them as prototypical comics. In fact, it’s not just a brilliant biographical novel: it's also a visual treatise on sequential movement that belongs in the hands of any student of comics as well as cinema. Kylooe by Little Thunder (Dark Horse) ‚ Best U.S. Edition of International Material—Asia This trilogy of intimate, intensely emotion-driven stories, unified through a cute, white monster named Kylooe is a heartfelt gem. First is a psychedelic fantasy of an outcast high schooler, a Princess Camille seeking her Little Nemo. Next is a melancholy romance for anyone who’s ever broken up with someone they wish they hadn’t. And finally there’s a father/son tale about government-mandated emotions that hints of Harlan Ellison. This deeply moving, eminently shareable book is smartly rendered by Little Thunder, a pseudonymous Hong Kong author/illustrator, with deeply moving stories that’ll make you wish for a Kylooe in your own life. The Smythes by Rea Irvin, edited by R. Kikuo Johnson and Dash Shaw (New York Review Books) — Best Archival Collection/Project — Comic Strips Irvin’s artistic legacy goes far beyond Eustace Tilley, his iconic monocled dandy and butterfly enthusiast who graced The New Yorker’s very first cover, with his Smythes among his more obscure works, most unfortunately, as it’s been an unheralded masterpiece. But this has been rectified by Johnson and Shaw with this gorgeous, deluxe, oversize highlighting from the strip, which originally ran Sundays in the Herald Tribune in – of course – New York in the 1930s, post-Market Crash. Every page is a chuckle and a half of clever and endearing banter between milquetoast John and Margie of the outrageous fashion sense. This collection reprints the best of five years of Irvin’s sweeping art and highlighting his eye for playful, innovative design as well as his graceful line. Of the millions of jokes about henpecked husbands and pretentious, social-climbing wives – hello, Maggie and Jiggs! – this is an undeniable classic. And among the back-page miscellany is Irvin’s witty 1943 Sunday funnies parody, Superwoman, which ran once before receiving a cease and desist notice from National, now DC Comics. Lore Remastered by Ashley Wood and T.P. Louise (Simon & Schuster/Image) — Best Archival Collection/Project—Comic Books Louise and Wood’s acclaimed, groundbreaking Lore is now reassembled for your reading pleasure. Part mesmerizing comic narrative, part text with intensifying illustrations, all serve as an engrossing and terrifying story of a woman searching for her father’s killer who discovers that mythic creatures, once banished from the world, are demanding to return. Newcomers to Wood’s art should find themselves enraptured by every image. This collection has added art pieces that astonish on their own. This is one for all lovers of fantasy. Jordan Crane, Goes Like This (Fantagraphics) — Best Writer/Artist You’ll find this in the twisted-mind section of your local bookstore. Within its trip-inducing cover is a daring compendium of narratives that span genres from warped Western to distorted Hitchcock to familiar, bitter relationships to oddly adroit wordplay and more. Crane’s wide variety of experimental, offbeat tales, splash pages, and interstitials evoke Frank King, Geoff Darrow, Seth, Warhol, William Morris, Shag, and, well, his own memorably sensation-inducing genius. Elsa Charretier, The City Beneath Her Feet (Dstlry) — Best Penciller/Inker and Jordie Bellaire, The City Beneath Her Feet — Best Coloring In this bloody action/thriller/romance, Charretier’s layouts explode and just keep exploding, right from the “La Femme Nikita”-style opening. Even in seemingly simple straight-on camera monologues, her slightest of strokes give us telling expressions with bits of business that reveal the character’s pain – tiny tears welling – or bitter joys in suffering smiles. The foregrounds and backgrounds meld into moods you can feel. This is nonstop breathtaking exhilarating, storytelling. And Jordie Bellaire’s in top form. Her colors are brilliant, as in both vivid and radiant. She breathes intensity into the drama and the action by choosing colors you don’t often see, in line holds and panels in specific tones that yell at you to pay attention! Throughout the whole book there’s never a dull page. Never. Jakub Rebelka, The Last Day of H.P. Lovecraft #1-2 (Boom Studios) — Best Painter/Multimedia Artist Red can be a raw, intensely disturbing color, and French artist Rebelka uses it to express the slow demise of horror master Lovecraft. Disconnected, bloodshot eyes are awash in crimson goo. A red-striped lighthouse morphs into a torrential scarlet sea. Blood courses down a hospital wall. A ruddy Cthulhu haunts the background. Lovecraft himself is perpetually presented – in the hospital, with his wife, with Houdini – in unsettling vermillion. Then there are the grays: the gloom that consistently surrounds Lovecraft’s psychological distress. In paint and ink, Rebelka unnerves us to our very heart on each and every page. After having read The Last Day … you may never view red the same way. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond (Drawn and Quarterly) — Best Graphic Memoir and Mimi Pond, Do Admit — Best Lettering Best Memoir Awards aren't typically given to a true tale of six sisters in England, starting at the turn of the 20th century, but there you go. A study in contrasts, Pond has smoothly and skillfully woven her 1960s working-class San Diego childhood into the lives born to British aristocracy. Also, Best Lettering Awards aren't typically given to works that aren't Todd Klein variations, but every single letter of every word in Do Admit is exquisitely hand-lettered on every page, from cover to end. And I defy any other graphic novel this year to claim anywhere near the skill, imagination, and wit Pond's put into the variety of expressive texts and talking, serif, sans, script, blackletter. And she further enlivens her narrative with illustrations of newspaper and magazine covers, movie posters, maps, and hand-written... memoirs, all bursting from panels and pages, designed, sized, and styled with the greatest dexterity as well as spirit and verve. Best Graphic Novel of the Year? Yes, and not just admittedly but absolutely! ImageTexT, v. 15 #3, edited by Anastasia Ulanowicz — Best Comics-Related Periodical/Journalism ImageTexT’s most recent online journal has four exceptionally solid, smart, illustrated features with a diverse array of relevant political themes: an exploration of Chris Ware’s New Yorker covers about school shootings; a critical study of anthropomorphism in Soviet political cartoons during WWII; a tough examination of Australian cartoonists’ brutal attacks on Chinese men in the late 19th Century; and an in-depth analysis of the blurred lines between mainstream and underground in the 1970s, citing Denis Kitchen’s Arcade, Bill Griffith/Art Spiegelman’s Comix Book, and Steve Gerber’s Howard the Duck. And hey, it’s absolutely free for you to read right now. How Comics Are Made: A Visual History from the Drawing Board to the Printed Page by Grant Fleishman (Andrews McMeel) — Best Comics-Related Book When reading a newspaper comic strip, how often have you wondered about the physical process of how they’re created? This question is hardly recognized, much less explored in-depth, in most comics histories. Well, throughout this informative, entertaining book Fleishman provides everything you need to know about the technical mechanics of the medium, which does a great deal enlighten us and enrich our enjoyment. His intelligent, humorous commentaries, with anecdotal asides, are simply a delight. All the information is presented in straightforward style, and expertly enhanced by hundreds of photos of massive machines and other tangible materials of mass reproduction of strips from classic – lookin’ at you, Yellow Kid – to contemporary to web. And as our Sunday funnies fade into the digital aether, why not spend a few post-paper weekends curled up with a comfortable copy of How Comics Are Made? Back to Black: Jules Feiffer’s Noir Trilogy by Fabrice Leroy (Rutgers University Press) — Best Academic Work The more the opportunity to introduce Feiffer to the world, the better the world becomes. And Leroy deserves the highest praise, not only for astutely situating this three-volume loving homage to noir within the broader context of his extraordinarily prolific and diverse art careers but also for his detective work on these detective stories, with insightful analysis of the ways in which Feiffer's loving homage to noir astutely uses American history from the Great Depression through the McCarthy era to incisively satirize and subvert our present culture. Also noteworthy is Leroy's appreciation of Feiffer's visuals: hiscreative reconfigurations of hard-boiled cinema devices into his subtle, sophisticated layouts and unique graceful, limber linework. Comic Book Apocalypse!: The Death of Pre-Code Comics and Why It Happened, 1940–1955 by David J. Hogan (Schiffer) — Best Scholarly Work This informative, engaging history takes an unblinking, insightful analysis of midcentury America's evolving culture, from the start of WWII to the institution of the CCA, which explores beyond the usual sex, crime, and horror comics suspects. Visually rich, with its clean page layouts and hundreds and hundreds of large, sharp color reproductions, this is the most attractive study of that censorious era to date. More scholarly books should be gifted with such luxurious design. Arthur Ferrier’s Pin-Up Parade! by Rian Hughes (Korero Press) — Best Publication Design America can count Russell Patterson, Dan DeCarlo, Bill Ward, and George Petty as its top echelon among classic cheesecake pin-up artists, and in the UK, Scotsman Arthur Ferrier is most highly – and rightfully – held in the highest esteem for his elegant, sophisticated renderings of the female figure during pin-up’s golden age. His prolific output ran from the 1930s to the ’60s, often in humor magazines such as Punch and Blighty over several decades. And now, Korero Press has released a magnificent, oversize, comprehensive, three-volume compendium with nearly 1,000 pages, including hundreds and hundreds of his brilliant illustrations, primarily single-panel gags but also comic strips and a variety of publication covers, adverts, and other ephemera. Ferrier's fluid linework – capturing his women's joyous spirit, expressive gestures, and even their evolving fashion styles - is simply a delight to behold. Plus, a couple dozen pages of each book are devoted to his own essays and correspondence course lessons on his craft. Most impressive for me is the superlative skill with which this dazzling, deluxe collection has been luxuriously packaged to a fare-thee-well with the highest production values by Britain’s master graphic designer/comics artist Rian Hughes. In 2020 Hughes merited two Eisner nominations, “Best Publication Design” and “Best Comics-Related Book” for his superb Logo-a-Gogo, also published by Korero. And here, he’s outdone himself. He’s combined Ferrier’s art with marvelous midcentury colors and typography onto the solid, sturdy cloth-textured slipcase box as well as each of the hardback covers. And then there’s the ribboned bookmarks, patterned endpapers, and luxurious cotton matte paper stock and crisp inks to enhance the vintage aesthetic. Pin-Up Parade! is easily the most spectacular publication of the year, bar none. It’s available in its entirety in England but at this time the first, Showgirl Sirens (1940-1949) – which includes an insightful intro into Ferrier’s career by Hughes – can be purchased in the U.S., with the other two, Burlesque Bombshells (1949-1954), and Cabaret Cuties (1954-1968), in the offing. Best Digital Comic — C’mon: it’s the 21st century and this category is totally irrelevant.

Hothead Paisan by Diane DiMassa Terminal Exposure by Michael McMillan Mafalda: Book 1 by Quino, translated by Frank Wynne *** (articles) (top) As another year comes to an end, inside my home there are no seasons, and my bookshelves look like they contain the beautiful, ripened fruit of a perpetual stagnated tree. Returning though, I fear that the fruit will finally fall before being picked. Captain Carrot and the Amazing Zoo Crew still swing from the branches of these bushes, as if their powers of flight were just shenanigans on a bungee cord, awaiting the lost weekend in their company I crave. And too many other tomes are still, so very still, and silent, just their bright spines remaining joyful and noisy unfaded from elsewhere sunlight. As I look again in my bookshelf’s direction however, I am safe in the knowledge that some pages have been turned. I realise this year’s reading has been mostly focused on reading about cartoonists. They have inspired me in different ways: Recently I have been following the line of David Berman on lucky lyric sheets and his Portable February collection. And I have been returning to The Angriest Dog in the World, celebrating that special man. Sometimes we don’t get around to eating all the apples on my Dad’s apple tree, and they land on the ground and start to rot. And that’s ok. Still ... I’m glad comics never go rotten. *** (articles) (top) Below, I've picked 3 books that were all important to me for the same reason: when you have been involved with comics for a long time, as an artist or reader , there will be inevitable moments where you question if the medium is capable of all that you want from it, you begin to doubt your deep involvement in the artform---then, if you're lucky, at just the right moment, works like the ones listed below emerge and affirm all your most utopian hopes for the artform. If your faith is wavering in comics (and if you really love them, you must have this crisis from time to time), read any of these books: Misery of Love by Yvan Alagbé I will be writing about this book at length in the upcoming print edition of The Comics Journal, here is small excerpt of what I wrote there: In a New York Times review of this book by Sam Thielman, a character named Michel's worse transgressions are listed, including that he "was in love with a woman who wasn’t his wife." Thielman read Misery of Love sensitively, but I found far more potent moments of Michel’s violence (both sexual and otherwise) in my readings of the book. Here we see how this work can be made anew upon each reading. Thielman stresses that he read the work multiple times (and recommends other readers do the same), but finds different fault lines than I did. Alagbé, in my reading, suggests that Michel has engaged in far worse transgressions, which Thielman ignores or does not see. In one sequence, his daughter Clare’s childhood self is confronted by cries from her mother "it was you who wanted him to be in love with you," "it was you who led him on," "little fool! how did you come up with all this?" One might expect an insinuation like this to occupy the climax of a narrative, but for Alagbé it is one note in the whole blink-and-you-will-miss-it focus and you’ll feel the tragedy, only for it to vanish by the next image — with the mist of it lingering back and forth across the book. One (to me, horrible) image shows Michel cradling Clare, during her childhood, in his arms. Alagbé uses the soft ink wash he employs throughout the book to a shocking effect here: the weight Michel applies to Clare is forceful, his face a distorted mess of wash, his hands cruel. This image communicates brutality, even in isolation. If we looked at it apart from the rest of the narrative, it would still provoke and we would draw conclusions from it, though more visceral than certain. Placed alongside 463 other images, all of them with their own unique weight, it pulsates. As we approach our fourth or fifth reading, the image lodges in our mind, infecting how we look at previous and subsequent sequences. The miracle of Misery of Love is that all 464 images carry the same force of reverberation. Alagbé presents us a "graphic novel" that defies the way in which we have grown comfortable reading graphic novels, which is as prose. This work is actually graphic, in that the images contain meaning independent of textual assistance. In a non-poetic work of art, there are times when information is presented artlessly: "he got in the car," "he ate dinner," etc. An elegant prosaic entertainer can make dead moments like these part of his rhythm, with meaning beyond what is necessary left aside. The plot, after all, must move forward at times. Misery of Love denies itself such license. One image gives us Alain (Clare's boyfriend, who is of African descent) in a car, next to Clare. Alagbé, without telling us, without prodding us, without begging for our understanding, depicts Alain’s at a remove from Clare. His stance, the tension of those seated in front of him, the contrast between Clare’s face and his, an ever so subtlety exaggerated ratio of proportions between Alain and his fellows — it’s as if Alagbé collages Alain into the picture, the expression he wears believable but at the tip of total remove from the scene he occupies. This is how the picture confronted me on my fifth reading. In my earlier attempts, I ignored it entirely. The anger within this drawing is all the more remarkable for how it can be shoved aside until the reader breathes life into it. The book concludes with a smile, one that, once more, throttles us back through the earlier graphics, casting new perspectives on all that we have just witnessed. The greatest works, in thought and in art, are not systematic but living organisms inviting participation of the heart and mind. With Misery of Love, what this final smile means can never be solved, but can be felt with increasing depth the more that is given to the book. The Devil's Grin Vol. 1 by Alex Graham I truly think this is one of the best comics of the past decade, maybe one of my favorite comics ever. With graphic novels as the dominant delivery system for comics going strong for over a decade, most GN's remain single-issue comic ideas stretched out to an undercooked 200 pages (or more). Devil's Grin is worth the pages it's printed on, there's no padding. And while it is long, ambitious and dense, this is a comic much more than it is a novel, its writing is in the drawing (a cliche we hear all the time in comics, but this book can explain the truth at the heart of the cliche) and I love how it's drawn. While certain panels don't match the hyper-perfection of alt comics at their most ascendant, there's no way anyone else besides Alex Graham could draw this: she gets the expressions exactly right in a way that a more "perfect" drawer could never do, all of Noel Sickles printed work (which I adore) combined can't equal the writing (and by that I mean comic drawings) that Graham's cartooning is built on. It's as if Graham figured out how to make the "great American alt comic" by synthesizing the approaches of alt comics literary ambitions with the "draw in your own way" mini-comic movement, which are more opposed than people think. If I was to show a panel from this work to a comics person who swears by the craft of, say, an Archer Prewitt, it may leave them cold. But Graham has, I believe, outdone so many cartoonists who wrestled with a dual loyalty to airtight craft and ambitions of "writerly" comics. Devil's Grin is wrestling with neither of those things, it lays down a gauntlet of its own excellence. Unlike your normal book-of-the-moment faux sensitivity, this work contains a level of emotional intelligence that so many cartoonists struggle to even approach let alone ever come to achieve. While there are intense/"transgressive" moments happening in Devil's Grin, this should not obscure that the book has, as its main focus, an investment in how people treat each other and a sense of moral clarity that most muddled graphic novels never even bother to broach. The Complete C Comics by Joe Brainard (and many more). Essay by Bill Kartalopoulos, Foreword by Ron Padgett. Looking at this new C Comics collection brought up some thoughts. Since the early '00s, poetry comics DID happen, but they did NOT happen in publications like Ink Brick. There is the famous Jean Cocteau quote about a child prodigy poet, Minou Drouet. When asked what he thought of her, Cocteau said "all children are poets, except Minou Drouet." That's how I feel about Ink Brick. All comics [have the potential to be] poetic, except those published in Ink Brick, comics that just graft cartooning onto outdated and conservative poetic forms. What's happening now, at the heart of comics fringes, is something different than simply breaking up a sentence over many panels and calling it "comics poetry." Instead, many young artists focus on publishing work that is a short exploration of a thought or a feeling, and this exploration unifies text and imagery in the pursuit of eliciting feeling from the reader. Instead of naturalistic fiction (which dominated alternative comic spaces in the '80s and '90s) we begin to see less and less focus on characters. Even autobio seems to be disintegrating. Self-publishing art cartoonists now often begin with an unnamed person speaking directly to the reader, with great focus on how such a person poses on the page, how they carry their weight. We see, in these kinds of comics, an avoidance of epiphany and an avoidance of resolution, though (crucially) without an avoidance of feeling. If we attempt to trace the origins of this, I'd say Doucet looms large, though I'd narrow her influence to before her concessions to alt comic conventions got the better of her (New York Diary and everything that came after, until her return to form with Time Zone J). In an early Doucet strip, called "Month of December," Doucet stands on a bridge and says "Christmas is coming." She sniffs her nose, "it's cold." In the final panel, she hurls herself off the bridge: "... and I'm gonna die?" That is the entire strip. Is it about suicide? Depression? Maybe, but no simple prosaic judgement can contain the strips power. So many emerging cartoonists work in this way today. This makes sense, as pure comics get at the core of poetry better than poetry itself could. Poetry strives to make expression new while working with an inherited set of symbols, the letters of the alphabet you write your poetry in. A comic like Doucet's goes farther, she does not write "I stood on the bridge and began to speak to you." She draws the bridge, her description of this specific bridge is already charged with a poetry that the letters themselves could never contain, no matter how you place them or rearrange them (all the tortured word placement of modernist poetry could have been solved, it seems, with drawing). Traditional cartoonists worked hard to make the bridge disappear. If Milton Caniff's story required him to draw a bridge, he'd do it perfectly, but so perfectly that you would not notice it or linger on it, the bridge merely a prosaic detail to connect point A to point B, no matter how proudly he drew it. Doucet allows the charge of her expression to be seen in every line, you ignore nothing, it's all part of the whole, just as nothing can be discarded or ignored in poetry. Doucet, and the generation that embraces her approach, is not like the group of avant-garde poets who made C Comics. Joe Brainard and his ilk lived and breathed what poetry was and is, they devoted their life to it. When they sought to make comics, the tools of poetic expression were already on call within them, and the tools were finely honed. The work in C Comics feels mature and exact, work made by people conscious of what they were doing. Poetry comics circa 2025 are most often made by those with no (or little) interest in orthodox poetry, but instead in how comics can be used for self expression. This search for how to use comics in a mature way has been subverted and derailed for a century. When someone taps into the poetic potential of comics, you see it happen on the page, you feel the charge, "finally, this is how it can be done!" Lately, I see this moment of conception everywhere, all the parts coming into place organically and the thrill of artistic gestalt happening in a way that it has really never happened before, the absolute triumph of raw artistic discovery. You'd think C Comics would connect to this, but it feels oddly distant, not so much a relative to today's explosion as it is an acquaintance who, if you come to think of it, you never actually met. And yet, despite this disconnect: as contemporary underground and fringe comics lean deeper into their poetic destiny, it is very important that this book is out now. C Comics is a tome that can now be corresponded with, there is enough strength in contemporary and organic poetic comics that the community making them won't be bulldozed by what is within this book ("it's already been done"). Instead it can act as a prophecy that you missed, and reading it now is exhilarating in its affirmation but not so influential as to change the flow of where we are already headed. Post Script: I haven't finished Melissa Mendes' The Weight yet, but I read the early chapters years ago and found them incredible. This list wouldn't be complete without mentioning this book that I look forward to reading in full in the new year. *** (articles) (top) I’ve been on a monthly comic embargo since I left high school, but 2025 was the year to reel me back in. Kieron Gillen and Caspar Wijngaard started knocking down the dominos they’ve been setting up for the past 10 issues of Power Fantasy. Christopher Priest's essays at the end of Marvel Knights: The World to Come have been just as engaging as Joe Quesada’s art. But without a doubt Absolute Martian Manhunter was the mainstream comic of the year. Deniz Camp and Javier Rodriguez are working in the Vertigo-tradition: reimagine a dusty DC IP, let the writer cram in as many purple prose captions as they need to describe the human condition, and pair them with an artist who can work outside the current house style. Probably their greatest achievement is making a comic with art that communicates instead of just illustrates. The fourth issue of the series starts with the cosmic-bringer of bad vibes known as “The White Martian” drawn like the silhouette on a men’s bathroom sign, with a black body and white circle head. In the next panel he lifts his head from his neck, then in the third he places it into the sky on the fourth panel, creating a heat wave that drives an entire city into a homicidal frenzy. Later in that same issue, the metaphorical enlightenment-golem known only as “The Martian” grabs a ray of white sunlight reflected in the protagonist’s eye, stretches it in his blocky hands, and separates it into three circular colors: red, green, and blue, the three colors that make up visible light. He overlaps the red and green–coincidentally the same colors used to signify the presence of The Martian throughout the comic–to create the color yellow, which he then places onto the city’s horizon as a setting sun, calming the madness and making everything right. It doesn’t make much sense explaining it, but you’ll love it when you see it. In the indie scene, I read some great stuff this year. Harper B’s Bring Me the Head of Susan Lomond was an extremely enjoyable one-shot that proves that funny comics usually have funny art. Corinne Halbert’s still finding fresh and funky ways to express her psychological journey to happiness in her newest installments of Scorpio Venus Rising. Audra Stang’s Another Year comics on Instagram are expanding the lore of Valley Valley and Idella Delle in tiny snippets that leave me wanting something longer. I also had the pleasure of picking up the first issue of Monograph Magazine at this year’s MICE Expo: a fanzine edited by Ivy Lynn Allie, E.B. Sciales, and Warren Bernard focusing on single panel cartoonists. This inaugural issue goes over the life of single panel cartoonist and first woman member of the National Cartoonists Society Hilda Terry. These were all small press triumphs, but if I had to choose a favorite indie of this year, I’m going with the obvious choice. I might be one of the four people currently reading Love and Rockets who’s closer in age to Tonta than Maggie. Life Drawing is the second trade starring Jaime’s new protagonist and her circle of friends/family. It’s nice to see Tonta get some breathing room after her last story, which felt like she was competing for attention with her pulpy family drama. Here we get an intergenerational crossover with Maggie and Ray while also getting to meet some of Tonta’s peers — I’m personally attached to the bug-eyed comic-lover Gomez, whose life feels closer to where I was at as a teenager than the more free-range Tonta. It’s a little disappointing that we only have 130 pages after ten years. Even two back-to-back weddings felt understated, but this collection gives the feeling that Jaime’s working up to something big. Until then, I’ll be reading and rereading what I have, just like with all of Jaime’s other comics. *** (articles) (top) 2025 was a terrible year in many, many ways, but it was a great year for comics. Here's a dozen or so of my favorites from the past year: Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me: Mimi Pond's books are always great, and she just keeps getting better. Spent: Enter the Bechdelverse? Alternate reality Alison Bechdel hangs out in Vermont with the Dykes to Watch Out For cast and it's an amazing read. Raised by Ghosts: Briana Loewinsohn's been one of my favorite minicomics creators for years, and her graphic novels are even better. Life Drawing: Jaime Hernandez has been so consistently great for so long that people don't even comment on it when he drops another classic. The Love and Rockets curse. Absolute Batman: Extreme in all the best ways. Just a blast. Transformers: Another nostalgia trip, but a fun one. The '80s Transformers comic book we see in our heads when we think of what we were reading 40 years ago. The G.I. Joe and Void Rivals tie-ins from Skybound have been a lot of fun, too, and I'm glad that Larry Hama's still writing a monthly G.I. Joe comic and hope he gets to keep on doing that as long as he wants. You and Me on Repeat: Mary Shyne's debut graphic novel. Groundhog Day with teen angst and quantum mechanics in the mix. Looking forward to seeing what she does next. And to Think We Started as a Book Club ...: A best-of collection of New Yorker cartoons from Tom Toro, one of my favorite cartoonists from that magazine's 100-year run. Actual laugh-out-loud cartoons. Instagram cartoons from Joey Alison Sayers, Jeffrey Brown, Mike Dawson, Jen Sorensen, and Luke McGarry: I'm not on Instagram all that often, but the political, diary, and just-plain-weird comics from these artists help get me through the day. Ooops...I Just Catharted! 50 Years of Cathartic Comics: Terrific hardcover collection of unsung visionary Rupert Kinnard's Cathartic Comics from Stacked Deck Press. I hope this book leads to a reappraisal and renewed appreciation for his groundbreaking comics. The Essential Peanuts: Did we really need another Peanuts book? Of course we did! Mark Evanier on Charles Schulz with some all-star cartoonists sharing stories about the world's greatest comic strip. What's not to love? Almost Sunset: Wahab Algarmi's debut graphic novel has a lot of heart, and I think kids and parents will be reading this one and sharing it with friends and family for years to come. Top Two "conflict of interest" books of 2025: The Nefarious Nights of Willowweep Manor: The follow-up to Shaenon K. Garrity and Christopher Baldwin's hilarious The Dire Days of Willowweep Manor. Madcap hijinks for anyone who loves Agatha Christie and Jane Austen, or who's seen the Clue movie fifty times. I'd love for them to do a third book to make this a trilogy. Snoopy, The Story of My Life: The Myth, The Legend, The Beagle! Did we really need another Peanuts book? I must think so, or I wouldn't have written this one, Snoopy's autobiography, illustrated with classic Peanuts comic strips. I love the design, too, which looks and feels like a book I'd have checked out from my local library a hundred times as a kid. *** (articles) (top) I can’t remember how I got hung up on the Mitford sisters and their what-do-you-mean-one-of-them-was-a-duchess-and-one-was-a-Communist-and-two-were-literal-Nazis drama, though it probably started with reading Nancy’s gossipy biography of Enlightenment scientist Émilie de Châtelet, Voltaire in Love. And I’ve been a fan of Mimi Pond since … well, if it’s too glib to say “The Simpsons,” her two graphic memoirs about working at a diner in Oakland are fabulous, not to mention essential reading if you want to live in the Bay Area. So for me the event of the year, no contest, was Pond’s Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me. Pond’s cartooning is smart and witty and just weird enough to do the Milfords justice. Read with your jaw dropped from beginning to end. In other, non-Pond news, this was a great year for new artist debuts. Kayla E. came out of nowhere for me, which probably means I was looking in the wrong places, but Precious Rubbish blew me away. So did Yudori’s historical drama Raging Clouds, in different but equally powerful ways. Ben Wickey’s More Weight: A Salem Story is a towering achievement, but then there’s the quieter beauty of Lee Dean’s The Girl Who Flew Away. Finally, this is an amazing time for manga. We’re finally getting a lot of great older manga in translation, including The Legend of Kamui, Ashita no Joe, and, from secret essential comics publisher New York Review Books, Fumiko Takano's Miss Ruki. Takano is primarily an alternative manga artist, and if more of her work gets translated it will blow your brains out your ears. Gene Bride by Hitomi Takano is an amazing feminist sci-fi manga that I hope is getting the attention it deserves. Oh, and everything out of Smudge is a must-read for me because I cannot resist gross old manga, but this year’s Smudge standout is Shinichi Koga's Mansect. MANSECT! MANSECT! MANSECT! MANSECT! MANSECT! Happy holidays! *** (articles) (top) My list of 3 favorites this year are all smart, tender stories that attend to the topic of growing up, but in very different ways. Precious Rubbish by Kayla E. (Fantagraphics) Clever, distinct and devastating, the trauma and resilience of Li’l Kayla are delivered in a clean and spooky mid-twentieth-century comics frame. Through a dense intertextual web, Precious Rubbish expands and illuminates the potential of the form. Jelly Cake #2 by Stef Choi (self published, stefchoi.com) Animator-turned-cartoonist Stef Choi’s autobiographical coming-of-age comics are a delight. While other girls are donning thongs, tween Stef wears a homemade diaper-sized menstrual pad to school where she dodges racial epithets and pines only for nacho day and a boy named Michael Camaro. Cannon by Lee Lai (Drawn & Quarterly) When I finished reading Lee Lai’s book the first time, the words I chose to describe it were: “a rich story, elegantly told." The characters in this gorgeously rendered black and gray graphic novel are written with intricate, intersecting plot lines that explore family (both blood relations and queer-chosen), grief, growing up, repression, and rage. Watch for magpies, meditation, and plantar fasciitis. *** (articles) (top) We're all here on this end of year round up because we LOVE comics. I’m a comic book artist who also happens to work at a comic book shop. You can find me slinging books, Blu-rays, toys and more at legendary Sci-fi megastore & emporium, Forbidden Planet in NYC. These were the books that made the biggest impact on me this past year. Whether they made me think, grow a big smile on my face, laugh out loud or cry watery tears, these books had the GOODS. In no particular order, here's a selection of 20 outstanding works from 2025, in a medium I truly adore ... COMICS. Okay, okay, you got me. It's actually 21 comics. I tried and tried to make this list an even 20, alas some great stuff came out right at the end of the year and I couldn't leave any of these gems out. Without further adieu ... Tales of Paranoia by R. Crumb (Fantagraphics) FAN-FUCKING-TASTIC! Still intensely thinking about it and I read this puppy WEEKS ago. Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp and Javier Rodríguez (DC Comics) I adore this series, Javier Rodríguez is a true visionary artist and his sense of color transcends realms. This team of creators is POWERFUL. Absolute Batman 2025 Annual #1 by Daniel Warren Johnson (DC Comics) HELL YES, get 'em! This was SO satisfying, DWJ gives the people what we want, this one-shot is truly OUTSTANDING. E Is for Edward: A Centennial Celebration of the Mischievous Mind of Edward Gorey by Gregory Hischak (Black Dog & Leventhal) This book is EXQUISITE. Getting to see smaller panels on huge page spreads brings me immeasurable joy, simply GORGEOUS. My Gorilla Family and Other Stories by Ichiro Iijima, translated by Ryan Holmberg (Living the Line) OBSESSED. This freshly translated 1970s horror manga anthology is absolutely bananas. It'll make you laugh, make you puzzled, and fill your heart with wonder and joy. Exquisite Corpses by James Tynion IV and more ... (Image Comics) So damn FUN and extremely DARK with incredible characters, genuine suspense and impeccable pacing and storytelling. The Ephemerata: Shaping the Exquisite Nature of Grief by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics) A beautiful and raw expression of extremely difficult experiences and emotions. Tyler provides the reader with a TRANSCENDENT experience. Black Arms to Hold You Up: A History of Black Resistance by Ben Passmore (Pantheon) An extremely important, well researched and compiled historical account of the History of Black Resistance that is lovingly told with beautiful artwork, moments of humor, ire, genuine feeling, and a whole lot of DEPTH. Beneath the Trees Where Nobody Sees: Rite of Spring by Patrick Horvath (IDW) Disturbing and masterful, this story has got me HOOKED. There Will Be Tears by Charles Burns (Partners and Son) Drawings so insanely beautiful they will both BREAK and MEND your heart simultaneously. The Devil's Grin: Book One by Alex Graham (Fantagraphics) Exceptional writing and character development, Graham builds a STRANGE world we can identify with deeply. Viscere #2: Folk Horror edited by Katie Skelly (Stregasporca) Soothe your inner hedgewitch with this outstanding horror anthology filled with MACABRE tales by fabulous femmes. Orphan and the Five Beasts: Bath of Blood by James Stokoe (Dark Horse Comics) James Stokoe's artwork is PHENOMENAL, this outstanding limited series has great writing and a well developed universe. His take on epic battle scenes and creepy, gooey guts and gore is a pure delight. Saga de Xam by Jean Rollin and Nicholas Devil (Anthology Editions) STUNNING. This blew me away, I had no idea one of my favorite directors wrote this lushly illustrated, magnificent graphic novel all the way back in 1967. THANK YOU, Anthology Editions for bringing this astonishing tome back into the world. Toxic Avenger by Matt Bors and Fred Harper (Ahoy Comics) Matt and Fred EXCEL at continuing the adventures of Lloyd Kaufman’s titular character, THE TOXIC AVENGER. Adventure Time (2025): The Bubbline College Special #1 by Caroline Cash This is so damn CUTE. Gorgeous artwork and coloring, a beautiful coming of age sapphic tale filled with classic Adventure Time capers and lots of chuckles. Skinbreaker by Robert Kirkman and David Finch (Image Comics) JAW-DROPPING artwork and exceptional world building make this a must read series. Moan by Junji Ito (Viz Media) HORRIFYING and delightful, I have yet to ever be disappointed by a Junji Ito book. The Confessional by Paige Hender (Silver Sprocket) GORGEOUS artwork compliments this delightfully wicked period piece about vampires, sinners and wannabe saints. Rats Eyes: a Games and Puzzles activity book (expanded 2025 edition) by Hyena Hell and Josh Bayer (self-published) Two completely unstoppable FORCES OF COMICS NATURE combine their powers to bring you a love letter to BLACK FLAG in the form of a puzzles and games book that is so damn fun, it'll completely melt ur eyeballs. The Complete C Comics by Joe Brainard, foreword by Ron Padgett, essay by Bill Kartalopoulos (New York Review Books) Curious, adventurous, kooky and GROUNDBREAKING collaborative comics made by Joe Brainard and his New York School poet friends in the 1960s. *** (articles) (top) The usual caveat: I can’t keep up! The sheer variety of “comics,” its profusion of genres, formats, presses, and publishing sectors, frustrates any bid for comprehensiveness. Each year, I end up reading more of the year’s recommended comics after I file my list with TCJ than before, and even at Eisner-voting time (months later) I feel behind. My list this year, a score of titles, privileges book-length comics and publishers of same — no surprise, as it was a great year for such. Come springtime, I hope to compile a drastically revised best-of list. (Thanks to Nami for the manga tips!) Spent, by Alison Bechdel (Mariner Books). Colors by Holly Rae Taylor. If you can’t get out from under your reputation, why not spoof it? That logic seems to underlie Spent, a winking autofiction in which “Alison,” the character, gets rewritten, Fun Home gets parodied, and the prospect of its TV adaptation sparks a nervous comedy. Spent boasts, besides Alison and her partner Holly, a community of characters from Dykes to Watch Out For. As Alison suffers from creative block, struggling with a memoir-in-progress about consumer capitalism, the larger cast steers the story into funny, humane territory. Self-indulgent? I’d say loving and ingenious: a playful, inevitably political time capsule of this moment. Kaya #24-31, by Wes Craig (Image Comics). Colors by Jason Wordie. As I said two years ago, Kaya is a familiar sort of story: a postapocalyptic quest starring two super-powered kids, mismatched siblings, one of whom is a prophesied Chosen One. Together they rove, and together they fight robots and monsters. I know, I know. But Craig has been running flat-out from the starting gun, topping himself again and again with pages of thrilling inventiveness and moments of surprising emotional oomph. The sister/brother conflict is credible, the psychic stakes complicated, and the world-building crazed. Even the robots have problems. Craig’s drawing and Wordie’s coloring go hand in glove. Pure, craftilicious pleasure. Goes Like This, by Jordan Crane (Fantagraphics). Crane’s best work tends to be elegant yet anxious: classic cartooning with desperate emotional undercurrents. Muted but astringent, his comics mix graphic classicism with existential terror; at the same time, the work is gorgeously swoon-worthy. This curiously designed volume (with varied paper stocks, an exposed spine, and visible stitching) gathers in more than a quarter century of comics and prints, walking a tightrope between narrative understatement and visual splendor. Compulsive worry and quiet dread are delivered with severe narrative control and deadpan pacing, but also ravishing color. The book is both a printer’s orgy and a masterclass in holistic design. Mike Dawson's Monthly Minicomic Club, by, yep, Mike Dawson (self-published subscription service via Patreon). Dawson lives up to his motto, “self-publishing is a power,” every month. Though he has many graphic novels to his name, and another forthcoming, his zine/minicomic service is the heart of his work. Each month he sends out a mini (usually digest- or CD jewel case-size), typically an observational slice of life riffing on pop culture (Hamilton, Stranger Things, Queen), sometimes from a bemused dad’s perspective, often politically charged. Dawson happily mocks himself, and embarrassed recollections of his younger self are constant. The work is somehow both high-spirited and contemplative, in a rounded, fat-lined, insanely readable cartoony style. I’m hooked. FML #3-6, by Kelly Sue DeConnick, David López, Cris Peter, and Clayton Cowles (Dark Horse). This apocalyptic, vaguely semiautobio sitcom set in Portland may be the best comic book DeConnick has written (and that’s saying something). A breathless farce about schoolmates and bandmates, and then again the agitated adults around them, most especially a tensely wired yet lovable punk-rock mom, FML nails the nightmarish, post-COVID, Trumpian world we now inhabit. Each issue hijacks different genres and piles on new absurdities, some all too painfully real. Artist López is assured and delightful, managing the chaos with loving inventiveness. This series fairly screams “passion project,” and, like a costume party at an ICE stakeout, gives me hope. Muybridge, by Guy Delisle (Drawn & Quarterly). Translated by Helge Dascher and Rob Aspinall. Delisle’s latest, tonally deadpan yet graphically sharp as usual, recounts not only the career of Eadweard Muybridge and the invention of chronophotography but also the dawning of photography in general and even of cinema. Basically, Delisle treats Muybridge as the missing link between photography and moving pictures. At the same time, his Muybridge is no hero; Delisle stays detached and ironical, treating the man’s trials and wrongdoings (even the committing of murder) matter-of-factly. There’s no pathos in Muybridge’s decline and death, but you can tell that Delisle is fascinated. Ingenious and insinuating — a rare feat of explanation and oblique commentary. Precious Rubbish, by Kayla E. (Fantagraphics). This is one of the most harrowing memoirs I’ve read. Kayla E. adapts layouts and drawings from roughly mid-century children’s comics, turning them into templates for a terrifying story of familial dysfunction and incestuous abuse. Taking up the aseptic formalism of Chris Ware, she goes even further, into drawing that is frankly stilted and repetitive, full of exactly repeated poses that give her pages a sort of Colorforms aesthetic. Filtering awful details through this insulating formalism, the book elicits feelings of helplessness, rage, and horror. This feels like triumph of self-understanding and release, as well as, perhaps, righteous vindication. Astonishing. Checked Out, by Katie Fricas (Drawn & Quarterly). Checked Out follows a young queer cartoonist and librarian in NYC as she researches an impossible project, navigates a funky workplace, and endures breakups and loneliness. Its 350 pages blow by like a bullet train, funny and fearless, in a sloppy-looking, ostensibly deskilled style that’s actually quite skillful and evocative (comparisons: early Groening? Allie Brosh?). The book’s offhand manner belies its pinpoint observations and droll self-awareness. I read most of it standing up, in one long, flow-state session. It’s that kind of trip. Smart as hell, and touching, with an ending that makes failure (by standard measures) look like victory. Life Drawing, by Jaime Hernandez (Fantagraphics). This latest collection from Xaime compiles comics that were already great as a serial (in Love & Rockets). I enjoy re-reading them in one go. Here, two of Xaime’s signature characters, middle-aged Maggie and younger Tonta, are on a collision course, in humorous vignettes that bring out their foibles, vulnerabilities, and assumptions (while also eavesdropping on many other believable characters: the usual miraculous repertory cast). Xaime has a talent for reintroducing characters you think you know from unexpected angles, and he does that here, oh so slyly. The results are droll, charming, and moving – and, of course, cartooned to perfection. Mansect, by Shinichi Koga (Smudge/Living the Line). Translated by Ryan Holmberg. Social outliers literally turn into bugs in this round-robin story of contagion, metamorphosis, and, naturally, body horror: an antetype of Junji Ito’s work, or, if you like, Charles Burns’ Black Hole. Childish bodies age and shrivel suddenly; people are swallowed; an infant feeds on its mother. One victim leads to another in a chain, and pseudoscientific rationalizations cannot quell the nauseating unease. Holmberg and Smudge do heroic service here, translating Koga’s creepy mid-Seventies manga into one handsome, icky volume. The grotesque imagery will eat you up from the inside. Oddly, I enjoyed this, and thought about it a lot afterward! Raised by Ghosts, by Briana Loewinsohn (Fantagraphics). This delicate, flickering book, a semiautobio reverie, evokes a 1990s girlhood via discreet, emotionally subtle comics, punctuated by revealing passages of diaristic prose (journal entries, notes-to-self) that appear as artifacts or scraps interleaved throughout. Bri’s handwritten notes grant her relief from a broken family and frightfully quiet house (her parents are heard but never seen). Loewinsohn, however, avoids overstatement, preferring muted pathos and poetic bemusement. Just over halfway through, Bri falls into a long dream, a visual tour de force, and the book shifts, ending on a surprising note of affirmation. The story is entirely Bri’s, inward, subdued, and immersive. Surrounded: America’s First School for Black Girls, 1832, by Wilfrid Lupano and Stéphane Fert (NBM). Translated by Montana Kane. Surrounded (originally Blanc autour, Dargaud, 2020) recounts the founding, growth, and eventual destruction, but also lingering influence, of Prudence Crandall’s academy for young women of color in Canterbury, Connecticut. Lupano’s scenario mixes scrupulous research with speculative elements, including symbolic characters whose voices amplify radical and feminist perspectives. Fert’s Mary Blair-influenced art is delicate but vigorous, cartoony yet historically anchored. The tale continually underscores the ambient threat of racist violence (sadly fulfilled in the end), yet the telling is discreet and the lead characters irrepressible. Ably translated, with an informative afterword by the Prudence Crandall Museum, this deserves a brighter spotlight. Land of Mirrors, by María Medem (Drawn & Quarterly). Translated by Aleshia Jensen and Daniela Ortiz. A lone woman tends a lone flower in a lonely, unpeopled landscape. The flower gives her purpose and pleasure, but anxiety too. Unexpectedly, a stranger befriends her and leads her to a land of sociable if vague people who surround themselves with mirrors. Among them, she feels joy, release, but also distrust. This Spanish fable about aloneness and community is narratively elusive and abstract, yet formally exquisite, built out of delicate linework, intensive patterning, braided symbols, and otherworldly, psychedelic color. The formalism recalls John Hankiewicz, the palette Peter Max, but Medem is unique. I restarted this the moment I finished. Tongues, Vol. 1, by Anders Nilsen (Pantheon). Tongues modernizes the Prometheus myth on a grand scale, yet in cool, crystalline, and disorienting style. An unnamed prisoner (our Prometheus) has his guts eaten out by raptors, over and over; gradually, the prisoner and his torturers learn to converse. Meanwhile, a young woman on the run may just kill the king of the gods. Anomic human functionaries (mercenaries, drifters) scurry around in the gods’ orbit; the very cancellation of humanity may be imminent, and the wastes of war are everywhere. Hypnotically designed and colored, Tongues boasts pages the likes of which I’ve never seen. It’s also bracing and prophetic. A Song for You & I, by K. O’Neill (RH Graphic). This middle-grade GN is quintessential O’Neill: a pastoral, pseudo-medieval coming-of-age fantasy with anticapitalist, communitarian vibes. Here, a headstrong ranger-in-training (with a flying horse!) makes a bad decision, then must atone by aiding a young shepherd/musician. Each helps the other overcome their shyness and regrets. I didn’t recognize the assigned gender of one of the characters until quite late, but that’s fitting; gendered self-recognition is key. The novel’s quiet treatment of trauma and self-doubt echoes O’Neill’s Tea Dragon series, but with more breathing room for spare, decompressed storytelling (and fetching, Miyazaki-esque art). A lovely dispatch from a great body of work. Black Arms to Hold You Up, by Ben Passmore (Pantheon). Satirical and didactic, this graphic novel depicts generations of Black resistance to white racism. Passmore writes with his usual offhand wit but also an aggrieved heart and new tenderness. Protagonist “Ben,” cynical and despairing, gets unstuck in time as his father takes him on a tour of Black history, starting with the betrayal of Reconstruction and coming right up to now. Passmore never ducks complexity; his portrayals of militants and communities are often mocking and sharp. But he’s never cheap. Ben ultimately embraces what he has been dodging, in a finale blending rage, love, and even hope. Epochal, beautiful, brilliant. King-Cat Comics and Stories No. 84, by John Porcellino (self-published). John P.’s King-Cat is a pillar of my reading life: a periodic gift that blends love, loss, anecdote, and reflection. His cartooning is beautifully spare and perfectly attuned to what he has to say. Every issue moves me. This latest one is particularly sad, saying goodbye to old friends (human and critter) and to his mom. I felt sad for John while reading it. Then again, it also made me smile and, once, even laugh out loud. Childhood memories, everyday busyness, Zen parables, an isometric diagram of his own bed (mournful and funny) – once again, it’s a complex, full-hearted treasure. The Legend of Kamui, Vols. 1 and 2, by Sanpei Shirato (Drawn & Quarterly). Translated by Richard Rubinger, Noriko Rubinger, and Alexa Frank. I first read Shirato in the Viz/Eclipse Kamui floppies of the late 1980s. These impressed me with their historical texture, Marxist critique of class, and stoic brutality. They were bracing. Turns out they were translations of Kamui Gaiden from the 1980s, not the legendary Kamui Den serialized in Garo in the 1960s. This sumptuous new D&Q series adapts (at last!) the Sixties work, with much drawing by Shirato’s assistant, Goseki Kojima. The plot is long and tangled, and the tone, unsurprisingly, downbeat and fierce. Kamui himself is just one player in the sprawling cast. Astringent comics: tough-minded, tragic, but grand. Ashita No Joe: Fighting for Tomorrow, Vols. 2 and 3, by Asao Takamori and Tetsuya Chiba (Vertical). Translated by Annelise Ogaard. This classic manga is a troubled story of aspiration and hunger with a melodramatic, utterly committed style. It follows Joe, an indigent young boxer, proud, belligerent, and rash; his mentor Danpei, a washed-up, alcoholic ex-prizefighter reliving past glories through Joe; and Rikiishi, a more clinical boxer on whom Joe fixates as rival and nemesis. Their rivalry starts in a reformatory (this is also a prison story) but ramps up when Riikishi and Joe get out of stir. Joe is often genuinely unlikable, an asshole really, yet I’m compelled to root for his rise. An addictive cocktail of violence and pathos. Ginseng Roots, by Craig Thompson (Pantheon). Craig Thompson’s best book-length comic, inspired by his childhood experience working in the ginseng fields of rural Wisconsin. Wildly ambitious and self-contradictory, it’s at once a revisiting (and partial repudiation) of his breakout book Blankets, a study in how agribusiness (in this case ginseng farming) shapes everyday life, and an excuse for globetrotting journalism. Thompson’s unguarded earnestness (practically a badge he wears) belies the rigor and intelligence of this sprawling, uncategorizable book, in which luscious brushwork collides with diagrammatic infographics and Thompson delivers some of the most gorgeous comics pages I’ve seen. I reviewed this for TCJ back in July. Absolute Wonder Woman #4-14, by Kelly Thompson, Hayden Sherman, Jordie Bellaire, and Becca Carey, et al. (DC). Tegan O’Neil digs this comic, and so do I. I don’t care about DC’s “Absolute” line, but this series remains their brightest jewel, a badass remix of Wonder Woman that feels more alive and radical than almost any other WW comics since Marston. At first, I thought the pitch (WW as a sorceress raised in Hell) was stupid, but boy I was wrong — as I said last year! The issues with fill-in artists (subbing for Sherman) are less awesome, reminding me of the genre’s strict clockwork and aesthetic patchiness, but they’re still good. My favorite superhero comic of recent years. The Ephemerata, by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics). This study in grief makes for a stunning exhibition of organic, inky drawing — cartooning dug and chiseled from the hard stuff of life. Its beauty underscores its weirdness: starting out as a Bunyanesque allegory about dwelling in “Griefville,” it builds a quirky mythos out of private, hermetic symbols, but then settles into literal autobiography of a sort familiar from Tyler’s past work. As usual, Tyler pours everything she has into the work, every shock, ache, and loss. The results are wayward and bemusing (like three books knotted into one, really) but also staggering in their flinty honesty and wise reflection. Mushishi Collector’s Edition, Vol. 1, by Yuki Urushibara (Kodansha USA). Translated by Andres Oliver. There’s a whiff of Kitaro and Black Jack about this weird early-2000s manga that follows the wanderings of a cool, laconic man of mystery. Yet the mood is different: sad, curious, quietly restive. Ginko is an itinerant mushishi: an expert in mushi, strange, protean beings mostly unseen by humans that nonetheless impinge on human hosts, imparting both strange powers and tragic burdens. Are mushi like germs? Are they like ghosts? Ginko, knowledgeable and aloof, serves as a go-between, Kitaro-style, solving (or sometimes failing to solve) problems caused by mushi infestations. Beautiful, eerie, and full of confounding dilemmas and haunted characters. Clementine Book 3, by Tillie Walden Walden has invested so much in this Walking Dead trilogy that, for me, its franchise origins fall away. The whole series is good, but the last book stuns. Here Clementine, her partner, and friends settle into a semi-utopian refuge, which Walden then complicates in a most disconcerting, anti-utopian way. Two conflicting leaders, both powerful women, clash over how the community should be protected. Meanwhile, Clementine is blindsided by grief. The role of violence in securing utopia is one of the reigning themes; what might happen to you when you trade human vulnerability for armored strength is another. Soulful and haunting. Comic Arts Los Angeles, Dec. 13-14, 2025. Not a comic, a festival. CALA has become the pivot in my comics year (which, I now see, runs from roughly May to May). When CALA was on hiatus (2020-2023), I missed it. This year was as wonderful as last: I got to see friends and favorite artists, host a panel, and learn about art and artists new to me. Many of my comics friends feel as if there’s a gushing firehose of mediocrity these days, and little of interest, but I disagree; seeking out new comics continues to be a joy. CALA amplifies that joy. Thanks, organizers and volunteers! *** (articles) (top) LAAB #3 by Ronald Wimberly, et. al. (Beehive Books) Apparently the final issue of Ronald Wimberly's political-cultural broadsheet-broadside, this time putting comics visuals from Tradd Moore and Celine Loup and others next to long essays in tiny print you read by wrestling the publication upside down. Comics as street literature, in a delivery vehicle you might fold into a paper airplane and throw at your local reactionary. American Reaper Book One by Pat Mills, Clint Langley, Fay Dalton (Millsverse Comics) An old Judge Dredd Megazine series collected and self-published by co-creator Pat Mills. There's some art by the unjustly ignored Fay Dalton, but the strip is dominated — indeed detonated — by the work of Clint Langley, whose pages of digitally activated fumetti images feel like putting your head inside a fan oven and enjoying it. On top of revisiting how Langley was augmenting comics with software in 2011, the book now forces you to reckon with what someone possessing one inch of Langley's gifts might type into ChatGPT hoping to reverse up the same road and get to this destination the easy way. Essential Judge Anderson: Childhood's End by Alan Grant, Kev Walker et al (Rebellion) Rebellion's eternal reprinting program presents (again) Psi-Judge Cassandra Anderson in 1993's Childhood's End, Alan Grant and Kev Walker's Chariots of the Gods on Mars number. For my money this is a bigger artistic deal than the near-contemporary stories drawn by Arthur Ranson which have become the anointed classics. Writer Grant's solo custody of Cassandra Anderson for 25 years was 2000 AD's greatest achievement that no one talks about, plotting a coherent course for her as a telepathic seeker who could still execute people in terrible ways without hesitation. This Essential volume adds Grant's final Anderson stories from much, much later, which are short and unhappy and repetitive and depressingly shallow, because by then the editor had clearly told him to knock all that off. Kirby at Marvel 1956-1963 by Michael Hill (self-published) Doctor Strange: A Decade of Dark Magic by Stuart Moore (Marvel/Bloomsbury) One of these is a self-published painstaking appraisal of Jack Kirby's grand achievements in the run-up to and aftermath of Fantastic Four #1, collated from primary and secondary sources plus modern community discussion and much peering at the actual art with a microscope, an extension of Michael Hill's According to Kirby blog. The absolute flaying of Stan Lee along the way reads Lee's creative shortcomings as personality flaws, springboards from there to his sexism and racism, and parallels the dogged persistence of Stan Lee exceptionalism with the number of people prepared to vote for Donald Trump. The other book reviews the first ten years of Doctor Strange comics from a fan-turned-pro's perspective, and indeed from Marvel's perspective since it published this via Bloomsbury. Being Ditko-adjacent compels Stuart Moore to mention the artist's "eccentric sociopolitical views," but that's blistering criticism compared with the glad hand offered to Stan Lee. A concluding anecdote from SDCC circa 2015 reports no shadow of The Man's late-life hassles as he twinkles in full magic grandpa mode, "a thoughtful man taking decades of criticism to heart." As with that bonkers official Stan Lee documentary, whether this is true or not is secondary to its role in brand management. The Jigsaw Review #1 edited by Mal Earl (Gweni Press) The start of an intended archival anthology series reprinting material from the UK's 1980s and 1990s small-press and indie circuits, which is almost terra incognita compared to the well-mapped things happening in North America at the same time. The Complete Crepax Volume #9 by Guido Crepax (Fantagraphics) If things had run to the original plan, which was ten annual volumes from February 2016, then 2025 would have brought the final one and the conclusion of the whole vast Crepax reprint project. Some bumps in the road have led to this year actually bringing book #9 of 12 instead. It would be fair to say the series has had its longueurs. But Volume #9 storms out of the gate, every strip crackling with sensual static. The four stories about Crepax's Anita character work as erotica and 1970s social commentary and horror fiction and the indulgences of a man drawing naked ladies, all caught in the turbulence of Crepax's artwork, trying to suggest what the sexy feels like not just looks like. How exactly does Crepax wring such demonic erotic mood from a little portable TV before a horny Anita starts copulating with it? How does he conjure Anita's self-destructing climax blasting the machine to bits, a smoking ruin between her thighs? You could stare at the pages for an hour and still not be on top of things. Mandala by Andy Barron (The Mansion Press) Love and death and resurrection in silent black-comedy melodrama and blazing Risograph-effect colors. On first read I thought the three main characters were Adam, Eve and Satan; but they might be id, ego and superego. Barron knows comics: the punch ups are all Kirby poses and power, and having ascended to orbit prior to a ballistic descent like Superman, the male-coded Um surveys a bulbous Kirby kosmos, asteroid belts and all. *** (articles) (top) I've been a die hard fan of the work of scénariste Alain Ayroles ever since I moved to France. This year, amongst other things, he released the final volume of the 'first cycle' of the intriguing L'Ombre des Lumières series, a transatlantic homage to Choderlos de Laclos' famous novel Les Liaisons dangereuses (and who could forget the film staring John Malkovich, Glenn Close and Michelle Pfeiffer!) The writing, albeit in French, is magnifique and the artwork solidly supplied by Richard Guérineau who gives as much life to bleak colonial North America as he does the manicured lawns of 18th Century France. Ayroles uses extracts from letters written by the protagonists as a narrative device throughout, keeping you guessing as to who wrote what, to whom, and why at each instance. I shall not reveal the denouement — because I haven't actually finished reading it yet! *** (articles) (top) One book that really stood out for me this year was Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp and Javier Rodriguez, which blends mind-bending trippiness with a totally bonkers and heartfelt alternate version of DC's green Superman cipher. The best of the Absolute line from last year (Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman) subverted expectations of the characters while still maintaining their defining core elements, while Camp's cerebral script and Rodriguez's experimental layouts and visual storytelling take it further to flip the script on the genre itself. If DC expands this for another six issues I'm there for them. *** (articles) (top) Like every year, I read a lot of things in 2025. Almost all of them were quite old. In no particular order, here are a few things that came out this past year that provided some relief from the chaos of the real world … Crickets #9, Sammy Harkham. An absolutely stunning cover and, as always, gorgeous art and compelling storytelling. My copy came with the incredibly cool bonus Hayseed zine, which is filled with sketches, notes, etc. Sammy is consistently one of the very best. Precious Rubbish, Kayla E. (Fantagraphics). All of the praise and attention that has been directed toward this gut-wrenching masterpiece is well deserved. I was lucky enough to read this brutal memoir during the process of its creation and knew it would be something special. Here’s an interview Mark Newgarden and I did with Kayla about the book for The Comics Journal. Crumb: A Cartoonist’s Life, Dan Nadel (Scribner). An utterly fascinating read that sets the bar high for biographies about living cartoonists, and controversial figures, generally. If you know very little about Crumb, it’s a great book. If you think you know everything — or at least all you need to know — about him, it’s an ever better book because you will learn much more. Crumb is certainly not for everyone, but for those seeking to learn just how he came to be the person he is, it’s all here. Here is an interview I did with the author about the process of making the book. Mineshaft #46. Another great issue of my favorite magazine. This one has amazing front and back covers by Drew Friedman, an interview (about death) with Robert Crumb, and many pages of great work by Noah Van Sciver, Simone Baumann, Christoph Mueller, Sammy Harkham, Aaron Horkey, David Collier, Robert Armstrong, Glenn Head, James Collier, Tony O'Neill, Jose Arroyo, William Crook Jr., Max Clotfelter, Billy Childish, and Joost Halbertsma. The Art of Lale Westvind. I have many of these Banzai Collection monthly anthologies and love them all. This one presents many pages of Lale’s wonderful art and has a very cool poster included as well. Banzai is really doing a great job curating important work by amazing artists that serve as great introductions to historical bodies of work. Smoke Signal 44 - Gary Panter Solo Issue. A 32-page tabloid full of Gary Panter’s art. If you were lucky enough to get your hands on one of these, hold onto it. It’s a thing of beauty. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me, Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly). A complex story involving historic sisters (who I had never heard of before the book arrived), this is a wonder–Every page is something to stare at for quite a while. As Tammi Morton-Kelly wrote in The Comics Journal, Mimi “delivers a luminous portrait of the Mitford sisters, a family whose charm and contradictions have garnered a rabid cult following.” Read the full interview here. Lattaland #4, Josh Latta. I really Josh's series of nasty gag panel comics, but this one contains something different. A personal story about his dying father set in a nursing home during the holidays. Leo Derek – In the Heart of Danger, James Stewart & Joshua Stewart. This actually came out … a while ago. It’s a 40-year-old treasure that has been unearthed. Definitely worth gawking at. It’s one of the many fantastic offerings from the new indy comics distributor Power Pulp. The Smythes, Rea Irvin, edited and with an introduction by R. Kikuo Johnson and Dash Shaw, afterword by Caitlin McGurk (New York Review Books). Like many, I would imagine, the only thing I knew about Irvin’s The Smythes were the couple of pages in Bill Blackbeard’s Smithsonian Collection of Newspaper Comics (1977). Johnson and Shaw collect more than 160 of Irvin’s gorgeous pages that show off his wit and subtle humor. ou can read Tammi's analysis of the book for The Comics Journal here. Scorpio Venus Rising #4, Corinne Halbert. Every page is great. Read a TCJ interview with the very talented Corinne here. The Complete C Comics, Joe Brainard, with a foreword by Ron Padgett and essay by Bill Kartalopoulos (New York Review Books). People can finally see for themselves the two volumes of obscure art comics that Brainard — and a host of collaborators — cooked up and self-published in the 1960s. HYPE*PUPjr, Frank Santoro. Frank's latest issue of his zine, which served as a recap of his inaugural Destination Dealers Con held here in Pittsburgh in November, took almost two years to come out. And this may be it for Frank's monthly color broadsheet. I'll miss getting these in the mail if that's true. They remind me of hardcore punk singles from the early '80s somehow. Hopefully all 48 issues will be collected some day. The Ephemerata, Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics). A beautiful book about a troubling subject, but one that we all must face. Carol spent many years — and hours at the drawing board — charting out her thought about grief to create her most ambitious book yet. Also, I had the great fortune to get a sneak peek at a few things by some of my favorite artists. I’ve read a bunch of the penciled pages for Kim Deitch’s work-in-progress tentatively titled, Living the Dream, and cannot wait for this one to come out. What I’ve read are autobiographical pages about his breaking into underground comix and they are wonderful. I’ve also read a chunk of Jim Woodring’s mind-blowing take on the style and format of a 1930s Big Little Book, Quacky. It’s nuts in all the best ways and unlike any Frank story you’ve ever read. Jim perfectly captures the awkward narration of those books and gives them his own strange twist. That’s it for now. Stay safe everyone, and try to stay sane. *** (articles) (top) Absolute Batman and Absolute Martian Manhunter proved the cape-and-tights crowd might still have some life left in them. Peter Kuper’s Insectopolis explained the importance of nature’s creepy-crawlies. Mattie Lubchansky avoided the sophomore slump with Simplicity. Don’t let the colors and layouts fool you, Kayla E’s Precious Rubbish made for bracing reading. Patchwork by Kate Evans sewed together the threads of Jane Austen’s life. Ben Passmore’s Black Arms to Hold You Up: A History of Black Resistance dramatized undertold episodes from American history. Yazan Al-Saadi’s Lebanon is Burning and Other Dispatches had relevance in this year of ceasefires where the firing never ceased. Finally, Taha Siddiqui and Hubert Maury’s The Dissident Club combined combing of age story and political thriller. *** (articles) (top) 2025 was strange: I witnessed a cultural reset that felt like a complete assault on my senses. Rhian Teasdale, the lead singer of Wet Leg, wearing a shirt that says, “Men are so back” is a good visual summary of this past year, and I’ve been coping by simultaneously gorging on junk food (rom-coms, reality TV) and healthy meals (books, good comics). As the gender divide gets deeper and discourse becomes rife with binary thinking, I found comfort in work that wasn’t afraid of ambiguity; that encouraged conversation and discourse, especially from a unique point-of-view. Here were some of the bright spots during an otherwise confusing and weird year: Do Admit! The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly): A 440-page historical graphic biography and memoir about the Mitfords, a noble British family of six eccentric sisters who were highly active in politics during the 20th century. Pond worked on this book for six years and it shows: Do Admit! is a marvel of research, writing, and drawing. Pond’s expert hand produces a light and breezy line, while dimensions and details are rendered in a Prussian Blue ink wash: her drawings are just as charming as they are immersive. While reading the book, I realized it somewhat disturbingly functions as a mirror to the present day as it recounts the history of fascism through the female perspective. As it becomes weirder and weirder to be a woman each and every day, I take solace in Decca (Jessica) Mitford’s story, who became a prominent muckraker and civil rights activist despite her gender and family’s conservative politics, making me believe that if she could do it, maybe we all aren’t so doomed after all. The Ephemerata by Carol Tyler (Fantagraphics): The first Carol Tyler comic I read was “Uncovered Property” (1987) from Crumb’s Weirdo #20, in which she weaves in a subtle statement about gender dynamics through a funny childhood anecdote. Tyler has continued to explore her family in her decades-long cartooning career, culminating in The Ephemerata, the first installment of a two-part graphic memoir detailing a decade in which she experienced many deaths in quick succession. The book is breathtakingly rendered with deliberate crosshatching that reminds me of Tove Jansson; I have never seen anyone draw trees like Tyler can. Though the journey through Griefville can be painful (I did cry while reading this book), The Ephemerata has a relatable candor that will make readers who have also experienced significant loss feel seen. Miss Ruki by Fumiko Takano, translated by Alexa Frank (New York Review of Comics): This is a complete collection of Fumiko Takano’s “Miss Ruki” comics, which appeared monthly in Japanese woman’s magazine, Hanako, from 1988-1992. These full-color, 2-page comics are about Ruki and Ecchan, two women exploring their newfound freedom as working professionals in Japan’s 1980s economic bubble. The book serves as a happy antidote to my overstimulated eyes, and it is no surprise that Otomo and Matsumoto were huge fans. Miss Ruki boasts clear lines, simple pastel colored palettes, and minimal yet well-balanced backgrounds. Most radically, Takano uses her comic as a vehicle for critique of this rapidly changing time in Japan: I think of the comic from April 9, 1992, where Ecchan calls Ruki for help with her brand new rice cooker. Ecchan uses her cordless phone to contact Ruki with ease, but Ruki, still using a corded phone, humorously runs back and forth from her rice cooker to her phone to give Ecchan the instructions; making me think about how when technology makes our lives easier, faster, and more efficient, we begin to revere the minor inconveniences of yesterday. Kus #54 ‘It’s All Good!!!’, anthology edited by Caroline Cash (Kus): Cash’s editorial voice in this full-color 160-page pocket-sized anthology is best captured through her contribution to the book, “Drunk Girls”, an autobiographical comic about an off-kilter encounter in the dive bar bathroom. Featuring 20 international cartoonists, Kus #54’s comics observe the quotidian through an absurd Larry David-esque, yet emotionally intelligent, lens. I loved the comics by Tara Booth, Anand, Jurijs Tatarkins, and Leo Fox. My favorites include: “Magic Novice” by Emma Hunsinger, a story that uses magical realism to explore the nature of love; “Double Trouble” by Vivianna Maria Stanislavska, a comedic yet existential exploration of work, life, and death; and “Jessica” by Margot Sounack, who defines the “Jessica poster effect” during a drunken party that is beautifully rendered in pencil and marker. Akin to her own visual voice, Cash has curated a simultaneously thought-provoking and gut-busting reading experience in Kus #54. Hairspray Magazine #1, anthology edited by Karla Paloma (Self-published): Printed in black and white and featuring 10 international contributors, Hairspray Magazine features comics centered on the female experience, especially sex— Paloma’s editorial vision is simultaneously grotesque and accessible, making the anthology feel like a worthy companion to Chevli and Farmer’s Tits & Clits. My personal favorites from this anthology include “Me and my Bouffant” by Martina Sarritzu, “The Terrible Story of my Hair” by Noemie Barsolle, and perhaps the funniest one of the book, “The New Carreer” by Simone F. Baumann, whose visual style reminds me of the late Aline Kominsky-Crumb’s — a 9-pager about a woman leaving her publishing career to become a sex worker. Bold, defiant, and capturing the spirit of underground comix, Hairspray Magazine won “Best Alternative Comic” at the 2025 Angouleme Comics Festival, and I’m looking forward to the next issue debuting January 2026. Prop Comic by Veronica Graham (Most Ancient): A feminist reimagining of Popeye in the form of a broadsheet 20-page minicomic: Instead of Popeye, what if Olive Oyl was the main character? Through dizzyingly creative page layouts that brings to mind the idiosyncratic compositions of Chris Ware, Graham presents Olive as an avatar to explore our modern day anxieties about digital communication, the economy, and relationships. Artfully poetic, I always discover something new when I re-read this comic. Szarolatka by Jas Hice (Frog Farm): An 80-page risograph minicomic about a young mother whose life becomes upended by a strange neighbor.Beautifully printed in Federal Blue and Red, Hice’s visual language is simultaneously playful and somber; making their depiction of femme-specific experiences, such as objectification and motherhood, refreshingly accessible and a pleasure to read. I haven’t seen anyone depict femme interiority with such subtle mastery as Hice does. Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers (Cram Books): A risograph minicomic depicting a surreal, psychedelics-fueled horror story about friendship and creative passion. Myers’s storytelling is poetic yet sincere, and her art exhibits a virtuosic talent for inking. There is an amazingly jaw-dropping spread near the end that I think about every now and then. I hope Myers makes comics forever. Wedding Juice, Issue 3 by Sanika Phawde (Self-published): I was lucky to get a sneak peek of the third installment of this Ignatz award-winning series at Gutter, a Brooklyn-based comic reading show hosted by Clar Angkasa and Mikey Maiden, back in June 2025. Wedding Juice is an autobiographical series that depicts the days before an Indian-American wedding. In this issue, Phawde uses bold colors and unique camera angles to show the hijinks that ensue when figuring out “wedding underwear” and “wedding priest” (you will have to read it to find out more!). Wedding Juice is distinct in its charming, empathetic, and humorous approach in depicting the cross-cultural experience– I’m excited for Issue 4. Tarwar by Ilan Manouach (Nero Editions): I stumbled upon this book at Printed Matter and was immediately drawn to its formal qualities: a black cover with its title in rainbow holographic letters, fuschia endpapers, and interior pages full of black panels that transform speech bubbles, onomatopoeias, and motion lines into main characters. Tarwar is a collection of black panels collected from millions of digitized comics across various countries and genres. Captivated by its aesthetic appeal, I purchased it immediately. Upon further research, I learned about Manouach’s conceptual approach to comics, which makes him no stranger to scrutiny, including of course, here at TCJ. Controversy aside (I’d rather eat glass than talk about AI Art), Tarwar is a beautiful book that fits perfectly in Manouach’s catalog as it asks more questions than it answers. Is it poetry? Is it theft? Is it art? Is it even … a comic?? For me, the only thing I can answer is that Manouach’s work scratches that navel-gazing itch that art school unfortunately trained into me. *** (articles) (top) No time for explanations or exclamatory descriptions! Too many holiday things to do! Here, in no particular order, are 10 of my favorite comics this year:2 Honorable mention: Absolute Martian Manhunter, Miss Ruki, The Smythes, The Once and Future Riot, Roy #1, Holy Lacrimony *** (articles) (top) I’ll start with Valley Valley/Idella Dell by Audra Stang, since it deals directly with the spiritual rot of resentment and self-loathing predictably bred by popularity contests, artistic or otherwise. Evocative, discontinuous one-page vignettes cluster around a rivalry between the two title characters; Valley (at one point shown ice skating) is the Tonya Harding to Idella’s Nancy Kerrigan. Stang’s cartooning is pared down and punchy, served well here by each page having its own rich two-color Riso palette, courtesy a knockout print job by Frog Farm head honcho Alexander Laird. The story is littered with screens, mirror images, and projections of both the electronic and psychological variety, while the zine itself is a material argument in favor of printing and binding. I first became aware of Suerynn Lee at a panel of New Yorker cartoonists at the Art Students League early last year. The organizers ran a slideshow of the participants’ cartoons on a screen overhead while the panelists talked, and Lee’s had a depth and bite the others seemed to lack. Later Lee revealed that she alone among the panelists started making each cartoon by drawing rather than writing. Now, I think Chris Ware was onto something when he said that “allowing one’s drawings to suggest the direction of a story is comics’ single greatest formal advantage,” and by all appearances Lee makes full use of that advantage. The drawings in her zine Two Snakes (published by Christina Lee’s Alright Editions) are gorgeous — sinuous brush lines and atmospheric washes, translated beautifully into stochastic screens of melancholy ultramarine blue. A haunting fable about intimacy, art, and the ways we periodically outgrow ourselves and each other, it makes me hope that Lee keeps making comics like this in addition to single-panel cartoons. I’m sure Kayla E.’s Precious Rubbish will — and certainly deserves to — appear on many of these lists, but I’m going to make a case for I’ve Always Known You!, a Riso zine printed by Travis Head at Virginia Tech. Where Kayla E.’s other comics get a lot of mileage out of the tension between the horrors of the story and the airtight slickness of the drawing and design, I enjoy the way the printing here brings a soft, slightly grubby touch to the presentation. Given her many allusions to classic kids comics, it’s a thrill to see some authentic misregistration, and at a certain level I think a story like this — characteristically concerned with abject abuse and neglect, as well as almost unfathomable pain and the miraculous possibility of its ultimate transcendence — should leave the reader’s hands a little dirty. I’ve already written about how much I love Gary Panter’s issue of Smoke Signal from this year, but I’d also like to shine a light on the very next issue by Tara Booth. While many cartoonists have broken out a paint box now and again, I can’t think of any whose work engages the language of painting — not only color but touch, viscosity, transparency, etc. — in the service of cartooning more successfully than Booth’s does. In this way her forms fully embody her primary theme of the tragicomic indignities of hungry, sweaty corporeality. Like Kayla E., Booth has an ambitious hardcover book out that should find its way onto many best-of lists, but for me the broadsheet format of Smoke Signal provides a more generous canvas for her discomfiting, hilarious, and often strikingly beautiful work. Nick Bunch’s How to Quit Smoking Cigarettes (Cram Books) is a sublimely cynical and enjoyable addiction/recovery memoir. Bunch, like a lot of younger cartoonists, seems to have learned to draw from watching The Point! on YouTube while eating fistfuls of brown acid and caffeine gum — and yes, I’m saying that like it’s a good thing. How to Quit Smoking Cigarettes is manic, breathless, claustrophobic, and compulsively readable. There's a grotesquely funny scene where Bunch’s lymphatic system is wrenched free of his body and subsequently holds a publishing meeting that’s worthy of Burroughs. I had a blast reviewing Mansect for TCJ.com, and two subsequent Smudge titles — Face Meat and especially My Gorilla Family— are also favorites from this year: glorious slabs of vintage Japanese grand-guignol weirdness brought Stateside with tender loving care by translator Ryan Holmberg and publisher/designer Sean Michael Robinson. And finally, the belated appearance of a U.S. collection of Quino’s Mafalda (Elsewhere Editions) — arguably the most important Latin American comic strip in history — is a major event, despite the nearly unforgivable lack of a contextualizing essay or even the years in which the strips were originally published. Speaking of context: if you want to be chilled to the bone, read it while keeping in mind Quino’s answer to a reporter’s question of what Maflada would have been like as a grownup: “Mafalda never would have reached adulthood. She would be among Argentina’s thirty thousand disappeared.” *** (articles) (top) Runaways by Rainbow Rowell, Elena Casagrande, and Roberta Igrata I have a strange and secret soft spot for Marvel’s Runaways, a book which definitely belongs under the "capes" label, but just barely. When the team was first created by Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona in 2003, the series was hailed as one of the most fascinating titles from Marvel at the time. The team had a wonderful mix of X-Men melodrama, Fantastic Four sci-fi concepts, and a Buffy-esque sense of the teenager. Second only to Vaughan, Runaways is defined by the writing of Rainbow Rowell, who has written runs on the series several times at this point, and likely has more Runaways issues under her belt than Vaughan himself. Rowell brings the same vibrancy essential to this run, which started in June 2025. It spawned from the rather uninteresting "One World Under Doom" event which recently ended to a collective yawn and eye roll, but Runaways exists largely apart from the greater Marvel universe. At its heart the run is a fun, jaunty character piece full of angsty teen witches, psychic velociraptors from the future, and existentialist Doombots. The series, which is coming out in trade in February 2026, is well worth picking up from your local comic shop. New Gods by Ram V and Evan Cagle DC’s New Gods is one of those rare superhero comics that were so incredibly ambitious, strange, and masterful when they were first created by Jack Kirby, that it’s hard to imagine topping its original run ever again. Ram V and Evan Cagle might just have done it. New Gods is one of the best monthly comics to be hitting the shelves of your comic shop. Full. Freaking. Stop. V nails the grand, sweeping tone that makes DC comics so compelling. Paired with Cagle’s intricate, jaw-droppingly beautiful art along with hall-of-famer guest artists such as Travis Moore and Filipe Andrade, the tales of Kirby’s Fourth World come to life once more. If you’re looking for a carbon copy of Kirby’s Fourth World saga, you’re not necessarily going to find it, but many of the really important parts of Kirby’s story are all there. V’s story is all about the grand forces of war and peace, beauty and ugliness sweeping powerful beings up in their path. I’ve always felt that Kirby’s work on the Fourth World contained in it a lot of the sadness of a man who had seen the awful realities of war and lived to tell its gutted tale. That melancholia, that sense of grief for a reality mired in conflict is all there in V’s New Gods, but also there is hope for peace and love that underscores all of Kirby’s New Gods comics. Ram V’s work is often compared to that of the British invasion, and until new gods his notable capes titles, such as his Detective Comics, have been in conversation with that movement. New Gods however, feels like the exact kind of elaboration on Kirby’s work that the King of Comics would have wanted. Absolute Martian Manhunter by Deniz Camp, Javier Rodridguez, and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou If New Gods is one of the best monthly comics hitting shelves this year, Absolute Martian Manhunter is the best monthly comic of 2025. Combining Deniz Camp’s astounding writing with the auteurship of Javier Rodriguez, Absolute Martian Manhunter recreates its titular character in a way no one but these two wildly talented creators could. Camp, who will appear again later on this list, is one of the best contemporary comic writers working. Absolute Martian Manhunter reimagines one of DC’s strangest and least appreciated Justice Leaguers as a counter-terrorism intelligence agent who begins to be able to visualize, touch, and taste other people’s thoughts and emotions as the world is overcome by a great and terrifying evil: Darkseid. New Gods and Absolute Martian both reimagine Darkseid in ways that put his other modern and contemporary depictions to shame, imagining him as a sublime, unintelligible force of irrational "anti-life." Rodriguez’s art, which blew me away in his Zatanna and Defenders: Beyond has evolved to unimaginable heights. Opening up Absolute Martian to Rodriguez’s colorful depictions of the human consciousness is one of the great joys of comics this year. I would be remiss not to also sing the praises of my favorite letterer of all time Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou, who is a frequent partner of Camp, and makes it impossible to ignore the wondrous alchemy of lettering. Ultimate X-Men by Peach Momoko Peach Momoko needs very little introduction to readers interested in the more fringe elements of the superhero comics world. Momoko had a rich background in underground manga before becoming a phenom for her watercolor cover art and her X-Men miniseries Demon Days. Momoko is a true auteur, writing, drawing, and water-coloring her books. When Demon Days first hit the stands I was blown away by both the sheer scale of the project and its striking quality. Like Javier Rodriguez in Absolute Martian, however, Momoko has outdone herself in her newest X-Men book, which reimagines the team as a group of Japanese middle-schoolers who gain powers and are swept up in the battle between good and evil. Like much of the great shonen manga coming out of Japan right now, Ultimate X-Men takes what could have been a pretty cut and dry story concept, and imbues it with an emotional weight and maturity you wouldn’t necessarily expect from a book starring middle-schoolers who get powers. The book revolves around the conflicting forces of grief and isolation, and friendship and connection. Batman Superman World’s Finest by Mark Waid, Dan Mora, and Tamra Bonvillain I’ve praised a lot of DC’s current editorial direction over the last year or two, but their current event, "DC K-O," is one of the most half-assed, lackluster, and generally uninspired attempts at a story I’ve read in a long time. That being said, some of its offshoots, like those of "One World Under Doom" have impressed me. Waid and Mora’s Worlds Finest is one such series. Waid is one of those true industry pros who tends to really get his characters right. He’s worked on excellent runs of Daredevil, Fantastic Four, and Flash to name a few. When I say World’ s Finest may be the Mark Waid comic I am most impressed by, it really means something to me. He’s doing God’s work in combatting the kind of punch-em-up driven idiocy that is at the foundation of K-O, choosing instead to write a rare character portrait of the two most legendary superheroes of all time. The book is driven, fundamentally, by the friendship between its two titular heroes, along with their love for their various Bat- and Superfamilies. Mora’s art has the dynamism of Jorge Jimenez mixed with Chris Samnee, and it’s hard not to find a smile plastered across your face looking at the candy-colored blurs of Superman and Batman flying across the page. Plus it’s got some really excellent banter between Supes and Bats, which I really can’t get enough of. Batman by Matt Fraction and Jorge Jimenez After a bit of a mixed bag run on the title by Chip Zdarsky, fellow comics powerhouse Matt Fraction took on the Batman mantle with Jorge Jimenez, who was also a standout artist on Zdarsky’s own run. Jimenez and Fraction’s first four issues on Batman may become a generationally excellent run akin to Grant Morrison’s time on the title. Jimenez’s layouts are filmic, conveying action with a cool dynamism that a character like Batman just needs for a good run. Fraction also brings all the best parts of Zdarsky’s run into his own, focusing on a Bat family unified by love and support, rather than the typical catty strife that lazier writers return to over and over again. Supergirl by Sophie Campbell and Tamra Bonvillain Sophie Campbell’s Supergirl is one of the most enjoyable DC comics coming out right now. It’s heartening to see a female superhero book written and colored by two trans women, and edited by an all-woman team, especially after the Red Hood debacle. Campbell brings a refreshing messy goofiness to Supergirl that I found immediately satisfying. Campbell clearly cares a lot about the characters she’s writing, bringing a great deal of respect to every page without taking herself or the series too seriously. Each issue is emotionally compelling but also downright hilarious, with this month’s issue being a touching and rather horrifying holiday special about abandonment and trauma. Ultimate Spider-Man by Jonathan Hickman, Marco Checcheto, and David Messina Jonathan Hickman. The name rings with a kind of super-hero sanctity. Hickman became famous for his work on operatic Marvel stories like House of X/Powers of X, Secret Wars, and his runs on Avengers and Fantastic Four. These stories are spoken of in reverent tones by comics nerds. They’ve become the standard by which all other superhero events are judged, and very few events measure up. That’s why it was so shocking to find that Hickman was writing a single-character book on Ultimate Spider-Man. The premise of this book is simple: what if Peter Parker became Spider-Man as a forty year old husband to Mary Jane and a father of two? The answer is a sweet, funny, and beautiful story far more about family and community than it is about loneliness. I think of Ultimate Spider-Man as a portrait of what our superhero comics would look like if we ever allowed them to break free of the horrifying chronal stasis they are trapped in. Hickman’s Peter Parker is a character who evolves and matures, is allowed to love and laugh and grieve. I hope the series is indicative of the direction Hickman wants to take his future work. The art in these issues really shines as well, with some of the best inking from Checcetto and Messina as well as the best non-Momoko coloring from Matt Wilson. Black Cohosh by Eagle Valiant Brosi Black Cohosh is one of the most fascinating books I’ve read this year. Brosi’s work is an experimental tour de force in this novel. Ignoring the confines of the panel and perspective, his art grows out of the page with the free wildness of an untamed wood or a child’s mind. Black Cohosh is a tough read, as most books about painful childhoods are. The autofictional memoir follows Eagle as he grows up in an alternative living commune in Appalachia. His speech impediment makes him a target for child and adult bullies alike, and his only nurturing relationship is with his mother, who takes him out into the woods to hunt for plants and herbs. I would liken this book to Jeannette Walls’s seminal memoir The Glass Castle, which details her nomadic childhood brought up by similarly eccentric and neglectful parents. Black Cohosh is narratively and aesthetically virtuosic and I would not hesitate to say that, if you are looking for something akin to an American avant-garde in comics and literature, Eagle Valiant Brosi is a card-carrying member. Cannon by Lee Lai Lee Lai is the cartoonist who came closest to making me cry this year. Lee is one of the most important contemporary queer artists of our time. The book is a whirlwind of queer love, rage, friendship, and loneliness. Cannon follows the harrowing friendship of Cannon and Trish as they navigate the trials and travails of an aging friendship between adults. Cannon is a book that could only exist as a comic, melding the interior worlds of its characters with the external one, creating a novel which hovers somewhere between magical realism and gut-wrenching novel. Assorted Crisis Events by Deniz Camp, Eric Zawadzki, Jordie Bellaire, and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou As foreshadowed, Deniz Camp appears twice on this list. Assorted Crisis Events is probably the most formally interesting work on this list, aside from, perhaps, Black Cohosh. The central question of this science fiction anthology masterpiece is "what if all the strange things that happen in a capes crisis even were happening to normal people all over the place?" In each issue, of which there are now seven, we follow a new protagonist as they are plunged into one of these crisis events; in one issue, a woman grapples with PTSD after she was forced to relive the same sixty seconds over and over again millions of times; in another, a woman must care for her husband who wakes up as a child with no memories of her one day, and as an old man the next. Camp’s work on Assorted Crisis Events feels very much in line with the formal experimentation of the great British Invasion writers and artists, who took it upon themselves to combine their narrative prowess with the untapped potential of comics as a medium. Like the great books of the Vertigo era, Assorted Crisis Events is the brilliant product of Camp, Zawadzki, Bellaire, and my beloved Otsmane-Elhaou, who come together in this book to make something greater than the sum of its parts. I should warn that this book is not for the faint of heart. Its vision of the future is apocalyptic, rarely, if ever cathartic, and all almost always heart-breaking. Adventure Time: The Bubbline College Special by Caroline Cash Caroline Cash’s Marceline and Princess Bubblegum lesbian love story one-shot for Oni Press’ newly revived Adventure Time comics is a real light in the darkness of this year. Written, drawn, colored, and lettered by Cash, the issue is in its third printing, and for good reason. Cash is doing what she does best: making hilarious and adorable lesbian rom-com comics. There’s a bit of her Peepeepoopoo comics in the one-shot, but really this is a book for young gay kids who are either discovering themselves or are in desperate need of self-representation. It’s a wonderful primer into the world of gay love stories in much the same way that the original Adventure Time was for a whole generation of kids. I’ve already bought two printings of the Bubbline College Special, and I’m contemplating getting a third, it’s that fun. Adventure Time by Nick Winn and Derek M. Ballard I’ve reviewed Winn and Ballard’s Adventure Time comics twice for Fanbase Press, at this point, and I could do it several more times without losing steam. I was an avid reader of the original comics from the 2010s, and these are very much in line with those weird little comics masterpieces. There’s a sense of freewheeling whimsy in these pages that reminds you of the importance of play and wonder not just in comics but life. If you’re a stickler about adaptations, and I certainly am about Adventure Time at least, you’ll be pleasantly surprised by what Winn is doing in his main stories, as well as Ballard’s back-up mini comics. They preserve the sense of the original cartoon and the old comics adaptation. *** (articles) (top) There's one in every comics library – that irresistible, untranslatable foreign masterpiece. You deploy DeepL and Google, but they surrender, unable to make sense of its distinctive dialogue. The gorgeous illustrations pull you back in anyway, inviting you to search each panel for clues. Yet even without understanding a word, this is a volume you pull out often, sharing it with friends, and dipping in at unexpected moments, like a favorite book of poems. Now, Fumiko Takano's slim, gorgeous Miss Ruki is finally available in English, deftly translated by Alexa Frank. This sweet, singular volume, praised by manga stars from Katsuhiro Otomo (Akira) to Keigo Shinzō (Tokyo Alien Bros.), is one of my books of the year. Miss Ruki is 58 kaleidoscopic views of friendship. Two small-town girls, meeting again as adults under the bright lights of Tokyo, try for a bond which eluded them in childhood. With each snapshot of their grown-up lives, Takano is manga's Cartier-Bresson, capturing life's decisive moments with laughter and surprise. Her pen lavishes attention on the least utensil, bicycle basket, and library book, while bringing each shop clerk as fully to life as her two main characters. This is how Takano sees, how Ruki sees and, by the end of this lovely book, how we do as well. Perhaps that's the biggest gift of this delightful collection, granting us a sixth sense – of humor. After reading this book, Takano's unique take on life's fads and foibles stays with you, revealing Miss Ruki moments everywhere you turn. *** (articles) (top) Crimehot, Alec Robbins, Silver Sprocket Rly good. Valley Valley/Idella Dell, Audra Stang, Frog Farm Audra Stang cartoons with such emotional audacity that the weak will doubt there’s any effort to it. Miss Ruki, Fumiko Takano, New York Review Books Charming and delightful strips, beautifully drawn, which, considered in sum and with the context of Alexa Frank’s excellent translator’s essay at the end, portray how economics impact the use that normative social systems have for difference. When money is good, a friendly weirdo can be someone whose choices simply don’t align with the mainstream but whose presence affirms that mainstream as a site of choice for those within it. “They” can flourish well enough in warm juxtaposition. When money is bad, the Other is no longer tolerable because their different value set has been vindicated — they become an unwanted example to normal, formerly-successful, people suffering a loss of security. My hope is that people reading Miss Ruki will see the folly, or at least the cruelty, in that kind of reactionary exclusion. A secondary recommendation — Miss Ruki as an asexual equivalent to Pusztai’s Jucika! Light-hearted, responsive capers, once again offering affirmation through difference in conviction. She and Jucika would be penpals, I think. Mal Maywood’s Cliff & Father Eugene, Instagram This is not a finished comic, or a three-block narrative. Cliff & Father Eugene exist on Maywood’s instagram and Patreon, and on Tapas; very short episodes, moments captured. It’s the warmth, though—there’s such a gentle, dogeared masculinity present, like a leather wingback rubbed to a shine — it’s the tenderness of rendering and narrative choice combined with fridge-like solidity in build that reminds me of men from storybooks I read as a child. Gabrielle Vincent’s Ernest, or Raymond Briggs’ comfortable, cheeky adults: the worn-in, tired loveliness cues you that this combination of young gay parishioner and old gay priest is supposition rather than argument — what if everything could be alright? Well. What if? World Within the World, Julia Gfrörer, Fantagraphics As mentioned, alchemically firming. The Perfect Mistake, Yev Yanko, Instagram Also not a finished work to any degree, also available mainly via Instagram, The Perfect Mistake perfectly represents the comics I want to be reading every day, casually, easily: psychologically-driven horny bad-person romance, drawn deliciously with verve and dashing conviction and texture. If you like Baldur’s Gate, Yanko has additional content you may enjoy. The Stone Cold General & the Maid Perplexed by his Burning Passion, Iruka Bando & Youka Koinada, MangaPlaza Beautiful, refined, operatic lifework with real commitment to character and costume design, over a framework of straight-faced yet devious world building and narrative design. It’s great and in my opinion socially healthy to see straight-laced, kind, thoughtful and serious characters give each other emergency handjobs without this being dismissed as either a gag or emotionally inconsequential. Plus-Sized Misadventures in Love, mamakari, MangaPlaza Cute and funny and DEMANDING. If you find yourself troubled by the returning onslaught of thinspo, take shelter here. What if I Feel Pretty was good? Like really good. Show It To Me Baby!, Keiko Hagiwara, MangaPlaza MangaPlaza hosts a plethora of “adult romance” comics, which means sex-forward visuals and very involved sound effects — amongst them are some of strong narrative quality. Show It To Me, Baby! is an example which pursues the tentative, creeping, insecure and self-sabotaging internal yearn of career-women’s-problems romance classics like You’re My Pet without assuming that the directly sexual must come later in the story. *** (articles) (top) Life Drawing, Jaime Hernandez (Fantagraphics) I read a few Gilbert Hernandez graphic novels I’d previously skipped this year — Marble Season, Bumperhead, Love From The Shadows -—and while they were all great, Life Drawing reaffirmed why Jaime is my guy. The culmination of plot threads begun in Tonta and Is This How You See Me, Life Drawing splits its focus intergenerationally, attending to both the aging members of the established cast and the fresh-faced youth introduced more recently. The tone feels wistful and melancholic in its sense of retrospect but also captures what it’s like to experience feelings for the first time, the combo stirring up depths of emotion constantly, even when it reads like Archie comics shenanigans, making for a reading experience that feels as profound as life itself. Misery Of Love, Yvan Alagbe (New York Review Comics) I bought a French edition of this a few years back, assuming it would never be translated, as the depictions of explicit sex that made such an immediate impression on a flip-through suggested a nonstarter for the book trade, and that each such image was a beautiful painting made it function as an art book even if the narrative were abstracted to me. Now that I can read Donald Nicholson-Smith’s translation, instead of my tentative fumblings with Google Translate, I can begin to suss out exactly how many feelings are contained within the bodies and expressions Alagbe renders so gorgeously. A reread of Alagbe’s Yellow Negroes helps to contextualize these passions within a more linear framework, but as much as I like that book’s stark black and white, the painterly washes of Misery Of Love are more appealing, while the story they suggest is shiftier, providing more to return to. (I should shout out NYRC’s collection of the works of Michael McMillan, Terminal Exposure, which is just really cool — his career begins with comics that serve as the historical connective tissue between the underground’s Kim Deitch and the later generation of Mark Beyer and Richard Sala, and then moves on from there to something that engages the undergrounds’ nostalgia for the visual culture of yesteryear to more personal-poetic ends than his peers.) Key Change, Miles MacDiarmid (self-published) There are cartoonists who do alright for themselves making comics about bad interactions with strangers at bars, or awkward interactions with roommates, but Miles MacDiarmid is unparalleled in his ability to write such scenes with a degree of specificity and comedic timing, so that readers understand what is charged about each scenario, while others coast on a reader’s sense of identification with a protagonist to say, “Ha ha, you get it,” before a joke is even attempted. You could call this “sitcom comics,” but MacDiarmid’s control of the page is closer to filmic than televisual: See the economy at which the first two pages of Key Change establish the premise and contextualize and explain the front cover, before we even get to the sequences of dialogue that escalate tension as the story goes on. MacDiarmid was a member of the Freak collective of comics-makers, and I must also mention issue 8 of Shaheen Beardsley’s Oboy, a series whose first six issues were collected alongside MacDiarmid’s The Hive: Coronation by Freak a few years ago. If most of the efforts of the younger generation of baffle and depress you, these are the sort of funny and well-drawn comics that will keep your enthusiasm for the medium going. Absolute Martian Manhunter, Deniz Camp and Javier Rodriguez (DC Comics) Credit editor-in-chief Marie Javins, because after years of mainstream comics being the worst they’ve ever been, DC has resumed putting out comics people actually want to read, with the Absolute line generating comic shop chatter. Even if you enjoyed issues of Al Ewing and Steve Lieber’s Metamorpho revival, it’s not hard to see why the Absolute line would connect with a larger, younger audience by abstaining from DC’s typical nostalgia for the 1960s. At least the sixties as manifested in silver age comics: Javier Rodriguez constructs a cartooning language in Absolute Martian Manhunter that employs the skill he’s honed as a colorist, designing his work for color to make for particularly bold, flowing page layouts that speak the argot of silkscreened psychedelic poster design in a way that can communicate to readers weaned on manga’s black and white pages. Deniz Camp provides the artist with a script to work with that’s not YA-brained garbage; characters move through these layouts with purpose and rhythm, telling a story with more on its mind than just IP rejuvenation. I’m taking one page’s description of a nuclear bomb screaming as a reference to Gravity’s Rainbow, while a plot point involving cookie poisoning seems to refer to both David Foster Wallace’s story “Mister Squishy” and how for decades the most famous bit of Martian Manhunter’s characterization was that Keith Giffen and JM DeMatteis made him like eating Oreos. It’s hard for me to resist this combination of formalist cartooning brio and a sense of having read actual books, and it’s rare that it even comes up. Tongues Volume One, Anders Nilsen (Pantheon) With congratulations comes a concomitant casting of blame: I suspect Absolute Wonder Woman, with its combination of strong drawing, elaborate layouts, and recasting of mythology, overshadowed Anders Nilsen’s Tongues, which did similar things, and I thought was certain to crossover to a mainstream fantasy-inclined audience. Tongues has a stately pace, years in the making, which Absolute Wonder Woman trades for the fast-moving continual escalation assembly-line-produced comics can afford, boosted in the attention economy by the presence of a beloved corporate trademark, coming off like the American remake compared to Nilsen’s European art film. Tongues is the greater accomplishment, simmering as the reader sinks into it, moving between plot threads it slowly braids together. Unfortunately, the 360-page Volume One feels like it just stops, rather than reaching an ending, with the climax and conclusion forthcoming in book two. While I’ll be there for the second collection of Absolute Wonder Woman when it’s out in February, (as well as checking out the collection of artist Hayden Sherman’s work on Batman: Dark Patterns), I’ll also be anticipating Tongues’ conclusion, likely to appear a decade from now, which indicates a staying power few artists can be bothered to be imbue their work with, in these days where the ambitions of art are flattened by the demand for content above all. *** (articles) (top) Girls Gone Wild #1 by Katie Lane (2d Cloud): Katie Lane’s comic has two sections; however, the Girls Gone Wild story has stayed with me more than any other comic I have read this year. Lane’s line feels drawn from life, as she collages moments into one. Lane’s dense, scratchy lettering is complemented by drawings that fill the page and capture perspectives in the quiet moments of conversations. Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers (Cram): Big Gamble Rainbow Highway is filled with paranoid compact pages; each panel builds anxiety and paranoia. Myer’s ink-only line is expressive and fluid. The moments that break open and Myers’ drawing chops break out of the page’s confines are what made this one of my favorite comics of 2025. Key Change by Miles MacDiarmid (Self-Published): Key Change scratched an itch for me this year. I was a fan of MacDiarmid’s Hive from a few years back and was very excited about another venture into his character's world. Characters that MacDiarmid can make endearing and engaging within a page of their appearance. MacDiarmid’s ear for the interpersonal is translated into one of the most entertaining and funny reads of the year. Leone in “Blood from the Stone” and Other Stories by Max Burlingame (Cram): This year, I became obsessed with Max Burlingame’s mark-making. It would be easy to get lost in the hatching and patterns of any given panel if the story didn’t also propel the reader through its blood-obsessed world. Shout out to Cram for the excellent presentation of Burlingame’s work. *** (articles) (top) "I don’t even know if I like comics anymore," narrates Tara Booth at the start of her contribution to issue #54 of kuš!’s š! anthology. This year has been, as ever, an interesting one — between unrelated personal malaises and various industrial impediments (the final downfall of Diamond, for one), my reading has slowed down somewhat substantially. But now here I am, reminding myself that there is, in fact, some beauty left in the world of comics. And what better way to start than with — you guessed it — š! #54. I’m always quite fond of the guest-edited issues, and in this instance guest co-editor Caroline Cash delivers a strong showing, balancing kuš! favorites with a nice bit of shock to the Baltic system; of the latter category, Emma Hunsinger’s lesbian fantasy-drama and Leo Fox’s almost-Nabokovian narratorial play certainly stand out. Elsewhere, though I typically don’t tend to sort by publishers in these write-ups, New York Review Comics continue to be perhaps the single most vital curatorial line we have in our little Anglosphere. Misery of Love by Yvan Alagbé is one of the most moving instances of form-following-function that I’ve encountered yet, while Miss Ruki is just about the platonic ideal of a crowd pleaser that still manages to please; Michael McMillan’s Terminal Exposure, meanwhile, subverts the common taboo-busting narrative of first-generation underground comix by looking outwards, both artistically and physically, for inspiration. (A special mention likewise goes to The Complete C Comics, which is a beautiful achievement of archiving in itself but which I have yet to read in its entirety; ditto Dash Shaw and R. Kikuo Johnson’s collection of Rea Irvin’s The Smythes, which I was hoping to read by the time of this write-up, but, alas, life gets in the way.) Outside of NYRC, too, we got two quite monumental reprint releases courtesy of Fantagraphics: World within the World is the long-overdue Julia Gfrörer shorts collection we’ve all been jonesing for (all of us with taste, anyway), while the archival Night Drive by Richard Sala serves as a beautiful road-map to the late great cartoonist’s restless career. The return of Anders Nilsen with the first collected volume of Tongues (Pantheon) and the first book of Linnea Sterte’s A Garden of Spheres (Peow2) proved a surprising complement, both of them focusing, through a genre-inflected lens, on that apocalyptic storm looming on the horizon and the beings charged, for better or worse, with bringing it forth. For Nilsen, this comes with some surprising divergences from his usual form (full coloring, for one; a much heavier narrative bent, for another); in Sterte’s book (which, in the interest of full disclosure, I had the pleasure of proofreading part of, for its self-published serialization), the cartoonist appears fully in her wheelhouse, with a charmingly-languorous approach to world-building in the vein of Angélica Gorodischer. Elsewhere, Michael DeForge (keep an eye out for my interview with him sometime in the new year) and Kayla E. both used life experience as a launchpad. For DeForge, the launchpad is a narrative one, as Holy Lacrimony (Drawn & Quarterly) draws — in part, and irreducibly—on DeForge’s own struggles to further that thematic fixture, the authenticity of human connection; Kayla E.’s Precious Rubbish (Fantagraphics), meanwhile, draws on comics history as a mechanism of aesthetic detachment (and emotional repression) in a frenzy to clean that which cannot be cleansed. The first issue of Joe Walsh’s The Shifting Ground (self-published) offered a similar aesthetically-driven take on autobio, marrying the textural directness of Frank Santoro with the cogitative digressions of Kevin Huizenga, while Nick Bunch’s How to Stop Smoking Cigarettes (Cram) saw Bunch venture ever deeper into textural frenetics while still maintaining a beautifully vivid and immediately-intuitive grasp on flow and legibility. In what must, for want of a better term, be termed “literary fiction,” two more of comics’ finest observers of human interaction returned this year: Lee Lai’s second long-form outing, Cannon (Drawn & Quarterly) is a mental spiral in the truest sense of the term, running in all directions with painful clarity; Carol Swain’s three-piece revue Another Way Out (Dark and Golden) takes a more sedate approach, forcing its readers to do their own mental and inferential calculus. And what of the future? This year saw the release of three striking books by cartoonists entirely new to me: Milk White Steed by Michael D. Kennedy (Drawn & Quarterly) merges a distinct strain of the D&Q lineage, from Seth to DeForge, with ruminations on the intersection of political and personal; Hidden Islands by Cameron Arthur (Bubbles) offers up some beautiful anti-adventure stories; and Big Gamble Rainbow Highway by Connie Myers (Cram) packs both an emotional rattle and a graphic one. Maybe I do like comics, narrates Tara Booth at the end of her š! #54 contribution. Ain’t that just the way. Until next year … *** (articles) (top) For someone whose one and only lasting dream job is writing a workplace sitcom starring members of the circa-1987 Defenders, I fell off superhero comics hard in 2024. I've drifted away from the genre for years, mostly on account of basic growing up, but this year, absolutely nothing clicked. Friends and colleagues insist that a lot of quality cape books came out in the last year, and I'm sure they're right; in fact, you can probably read all about them in this very article. But the few times I tried, I just couldn't stick with it. Maybe the whole idea of reading about imaginary heroism when we live in a time of such complete lack of courage leaves me flat. Maybe I'm just being old. Regardless, it wasn't hard to pick ten great ones from a year where culture so often failed us. I struggle to find a common theme: In many ways, it found me looking back at the great creators of the last few decades, but maybe that's simple nostalgia. But maybe it's also thinking of one's self as increasingly part of the past, as the future becomes something that feels all used up. A thread of something ending, even to just transform into something else with or without you, runs through it, of history as a nightmare from which we are forever haunted. These are ten I won't easily forget. Insectopolis: A Natural History, Peter Kuper (W.W. Norton & Company) The insect apocalypse has been much on my mind this year, and I'm not alone. In his latest, Peter Kuper asks: What if it already happened? What if the insects studied us the way we once studied them? And what if ... it really wasn't all that bad, after all? Kuper's wild, whimsical history of the relationship between man and bug is informative, entertaining, expertly constructed, funny, tragic, and addictive, everything a comic by a real pro should be. Life Drawing, Jaime Hernandez (Fantagraphics) It is often a conflict when praising the work of an established talent in the comics world: Are you praising them because of excellence or because of familiarity? Luckily for all of us, Jaime Hernandez leaves no space between them: these stories, with seemingly only the thread of the complicated dynamic between Tonta and Maggie between them, ultimately cohere with a shimmering unity that matches his tremendous draftsmanship, seemingly getting better every year, to a tee. The Mongoose, Joana Mosi (Pow Pow Press) One of the best meditations on grief that I've read in a decade, The Mongoose, with its deceptively simple black-and-white line art and its expanses of silence, reminded me of nothing on first encounter as much as the late Chantal Akerman's masterful Jeanne Dielman. Only the presence of a playful, ominous, and possibly imaginary mongoose keeps its head above the clouds, but the combination is transcendent: sad, funny, smart, meaningful, and with quiet, stunning emotional power. More Weight: A Salem Story, Ben Wickey (Top Shelf Productions) At times like this, when it's easy to believe this country was doomed from the start, it's almost trite to praise a book that so convincingly makes that very argument, hitting a large and prominent nail right on the head with the story of a group of puritanical fanatics that start looking for a special scapegoat. Wickey's canny art, the elegance of which skates right up to the edge of the grotesque, makes More Weight the complete package, the most successful combination of art and story of the year. Muybridge, Guy Delisle [Helga Dascher & Rob Aspinall, translators] (Drawn & Quarterly) Artists in every medium have been drawn to retell the story of Eadweard Muybridge. And why not? He practically invented the modern conception of a moving picture, and it's no surprise that someone as curious and capable as Guy Delisle would want to take another crack at him. Muybridge's life was almost too eventful to comprehend, but Delisle draws the heart of the man and his work out at just the right moments, his clean and expressive lines providing perfect framing for his subject's genius. Nocturnos, Laura Pérez, translated by Andrea Rosenberg (Fantagraphics) The most powerful and effective treatment of the menacing nature of nighttime since Roger Ekirch's At Day's Close, Pérez's new graphic novel establishes that the dark hours are just as full of mystery as they ever were. With nebulous art that throbs with the same eerie energy that infuse the stories, it's a series of vignettes that have the same incomprehensible logic of an inescapable dream. The use of color may be the most effective of any book I read in 2025. The Once and Future Riot, Joe Sacco (Metropolitan Books) Joe Sacco has been on an absolutely Olympian tear of late. More productive than he's ever been, he's also honed his visuals to a razor's edge, and the clarity and the insightfulness of his approach has proven itself crucial to the moment. This gorgeously limned account of the Uttar Pradesh riots in India over a decade ago, it reverberates into the present with undeniable demands about the nature of violence, how we know what we know, and the bloody ways in which those things connect. The Past is a Grotesque Animal, Tommi Parrish (Fantagraphics) The tumbling, ranging nature of Tommi Parrish's sumptuous work about identity, relationships, sexuality, and just about everything else under the sun wouldn't shine the way it does without its exquisite visuals, with their vibrant shifting painted surfaces, but it doesn't have to. The combination leaves us with a shockingly intimate creation, like walking through a stranger's house and learning more about them in every room. A vital piece of trans art at a time it is desperately needed. Salt Green Death, Katarina Thorsen (Conundrum Press) A historical reconstruction, an intricate mystery, and an investigation of the way we are harmed and helped by the people meant to have care of us, Thorsen's book — composed of masterful waves of shifting colored pencils that fit its historical period magnificently — tells the story of a disturbed man named Joseph O'Dwyer's life-altering encounters with the psychiatric system of Canada in the postwar years. It's a tremendous piece of work, making a small story resonate into much greater meaning. Tongues, Anders Nilsen (Pantheon Books) When I first encountered Anders Nilsen's riveting retelling of the myth of Prometheus, brought squalling into Afghanistan in the 21st century, I thought it was instantly one of the most memorable things I'd seen in a long while. Time and repeat reading has not disabused me of that belief. There is unexpected depth in the portrayal of its archetypical characters, and its honeycomb structures mirror each other and reflect its themes of language and history with precision and intricacy. HONORABLE MENTION Black Cohosh, Eagle Valiant Brosi (Drawn & Quarterly) Calavera, P.I., Marco Finnegan (Oni Press) Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me, Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly) Drome, Jesse Lonergan (23rd St.) Gaza in My Phone, Mazen Kerbaj (OR Books) The Giant: Orson Welles, the Artist and the Shadow, Youssef Daoudi (23rd St.) Holy Lacrimony, Michael DeForge (Drawn & Quarterly) In the End We All Die, Tobias Aeschbacher [Andrew Shields, translator] (Helvetiq) John Muir: To the Heart of Solitude, Lomig (NBM Publishing) Lovers and Haters, Gilbert Hernandez (Fantagraphics) The Magnificent Adventure, Milo Manara (Fantagraphics) The Murder Next Door: A Graphic Memoir, Hugh D'Andrade (Street Noise Books) The Pit, Erik Kriek (Living the Line) Simplicity: A Novel, Mattie Lubchansky (Pantheon Books) World within the World: The Collected Short Comix 2010-2022, Julia Gfrörer (Fantagraphics) *** (articles) (top) 2024 was a terrific year for the medium, with new releases by greats like Olivier Schrauwen, Rick Altergott, Maurice Vellekoop, Emil Ferris, Peter Bagge, Dash Shaw, and many others (not to mention a bumper crop of books by Charles Burns). Could this year possibly live up to it? Well, pretty much. Although some long-awaited projects (like Jay Stephens’ Figgy Furthermore and the fifth volume of D&Q’s Yoshiharu Tsuge series) got pushed back to 2026, there was more than enough to make up for it. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed everything listed below, and could have included many more if time (and space) allowed. So, in no particular order … Tongues, Volume 1 by Anders Nilsen (Pantheon) Surely this will be on many people’s lists. Superbly written, beautifully illustrated, and charged with a lightning crackle of dry humor, this bold reimagining of the story of Prometheus weaves three separate narratives into a complex (and timely) meditation on the present state of humanity. Nilsen’s most ambitious project yet, its visual inventiveness never lets up for a second, every page bursting with ideas that can sometimes barely be contained, but which never seem superfluous. To say it’s the work of a Promethean talent would just be too obvious. But I’ve done it now, so what the hell. World Within the World by Julia Gfrörer (Fantagraphics) From a distance, this beautifully presented volume looks like some long-forgotten collection of obscure fairy tales. The scary kind. And that seems appropriate, as some pretty horrible things happen within its pages. But no matter how grim they get, it’s impossible to look away from these utterly compelling tales of human misery, which are infused with a dark eroticism and flashes of pitch-black humor. Although recalling at times the work of Eddie Campbell, Tony Millionaire, or early Chester Brown, Gfrörer’s work remains utterly unique, the product of a fiercely intelligent cartoonist who isn’t afraid to stare into the abyss. Night Drive by Richard Sala (Fantagraphics) One of the best reissues of the year. Fantagraphics did an exemplary job resurrecting this early gem by the late Richard Sala (all but impossible to find in its original form), expanding the original self-published comic into a handsome hardcover designed by Daniel Clowes and rounding it out with a lengthy introduction and several previously unpublished pages. A delightfully eccentric mélange of gothic noir, Universal monster films, and the surreal serial epics of Louis Feuillade, it had everything you could want from this irreplaceable master of the macabre. The Weight by Melissa Mendes (Drawn & Quarterly) Ten years in the making, it was wonderful to see this sprawling coming-of-age tale finally published in a single volume. Loosely based on a memoir written by her grandfather, Mendes has crafted a brutal, but deeply moving and occasionally uplifting story that delves deep into the messy, confusing business of being alive. Epic in scope, but intimate in design, the whole book is a masterclass in cartooning. Deftly paced and using minimal dialogue, Mendes relies on subtle shifts in facial expression and body language to communicate a whole range of emotions, while layers of ink wash bring a richness of depth and texture to the everyday details of mid-century rural America that drip from every page. Another Way Out by Carol Swain (Dark & Golden Books) After more than a decade of silence, the prospect of any new material from Carol Swain had begun to seem very distant indeed, so the sudden appearance of this comic from UK-based Dark & Golden Books came as a welcome surprise. Featuring two previously unpublished stories and an extract from a forthcoming graphic novel (more good news!), it was a perfect showcase for her atmospheric pencil and charcoal drawings, and dreamlike, mysterious tales which seem both eerily familiar and one step removed from the world we know. It was like she’d never been away. Beat It, Rufus by Noah Van Sciver (Fantagraphics) One of the most prolific cartoonists working right now, it seems almost surprising that Noah Van Sciver has only released one new book this year. But that one was an absolute treat. Mining similar territory to his beloved Fante Bukowski series, this tale of a washed-up musician who heads out on a desperate, drug-fueled road trip was another perfectly observed study of the delusional but ever-optimistic losers in which he’s specialized for more than a decade. Very funny and oddly moving, it’s a paean to those people who, for better or worse, just can’t stop dreaming. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond (Drawn & Quarterly) You’d think enough had been written about the Mitford sisters over the years, but this captivating book somehow managed to make the story of Nancy, Diana, Unity, et al. seem fresh again. It helped that it wasn’t just a straight biography, but a beautifully designed and exquisitely drawn account of the spell these eccentric and quintessentially English characters cast over Pond when she was a young girl growing up in Southern California. Without letting up for a second, she combines their individual stories into a single dizzying narrative, told with a kind of dry humor that would have made its subjects proud. Tedward (Fantagraphics) and Pleasure Beach #1 (Self-Published) by Josh Pettinger It’s been a good year for Pettinger, with a complete collection of everybody’s favorite “Old Fashioned Guy” hitting the shelves alongside the first issue of what looks like being his most ambitious series yet. Both blend moments of laugh-out-loud humor with nightmarish undercurrents that give them a real emotional weight. The first issue of Pleasure Beach reads like an anxiety-ridden fever dream about returning to the place you grew up. But with several different plot strands already up in the air, we can only wait and see where the story might be going. War Epic #3 by Nathan Cowdry (Self-Published) Cowdry apparently had a hard time completing this third installment of his self-described "epic," which might not bode well for its future. But we can only hope that he finds a way of moving forward, as this tale of a Nazi camp commandant attempting to mount a production of Chekov’s The Cherry Orchard with his unfortunate prisoners is one of the funniest, weirdest books out there at the moment. Although wrong on so many levels, it never feels like Cowdry is just doing this for the shock value, and it’s been a real pleasure watching his already considerable talents improve from issue to issue. My Name is Shingo, Volumes 4&5 by Kazuo Umezz (Viz) Volumes 4 and 5 of this ongoing series take Umezz’s weirdly prescient tale of artificial intelligence gone wrong (through no real fault of its own) into increasingly bizarre and unhinged territory. What began as a seemingly innocent tale of young love has gradually shifted into a delirious meditation on humanity’s relationship with technology. By the end of volume 5, things are beginning to crack at the seams, the story operating at a frenzied pitch several notches above anything that could reasonably be described as rational (and no, that isn’t meant as a criticism). Volume 6 will be the last in the series, but how this will end is anybody’s guess. Being Alive by Simon Hanselmann (Instagram) After the disappointing news that Hanselmann’s zombie epic, You Will Own Nothing And You Will Be Happy, is on indefinite hiatus, Megg & Mogg fans were rewarded this summer with an unexpected treat. Serialized on Instagram à la 2020’s Crisis Zone, this was a rollercoaster ride of weird clown sex and unsanitary car-toilets, flowing with exemplary comic timing and packed with hilarious one-liners. It began by introducing unforgettable characters like Butts Farto and Potatoes O’Brien, and clmaxed with the most inappropriate birthday party you could ever hold for a 9-year-old, where one of the principal cast members was forced to give himself a long, hard look. The blend of outrageous humor and genuine pathos gave the ending an unexpected poignancy that made it feel like an instant classic. A print version should be on the way soon. The Smythes by Rea Irvin (NYRC) Perfectly timed to coincide with The New Yorker’s 100th anniversary, that venerable magazine’s first art editor is honored with a beautifully presented collection of his little-known 1930s newspaper strip. At first glance a sort of elegant cross between Frank King and Crockett Johnson (although a bit too early for the latter, I know), a closer look reveals something entirely his own. The Smythes was a light-hearted satire of social pretension with a refined, Art Deco aesthetic that stood apart from many of his more boisterous contemporaries, and this is a wonderful introduction, ably curated by Dash Shaw, R. Kikuo Johnson, and Caitlin McGurk. Crumb: A Cartoonist’s Life by Dan Nadel (Scribner) Of course, this isn’t a comic as such, but it has to be included anyway. An in-depth biography of the father of Underground Comix was long overdue, and Nadel unquestionably did the project justice, producing a well-researched and critically astute study that delved deep into Crumb’s work and background, exploring the personal, political, and social realities that shaped his monumental oeuvre. Packed with fascinating details (Leonard Cohen almost wrote the introduction to Head Comix!?), and not afraid to take its subject to task when necessary, it will surely stand as the definitive account for many years to come. And if time allowed… Goes Like This by Jordan Crane (Fantagraphics), Crickets #9 by Sammy Harkham (Self-Published), Photographic Memory by Bill Griffith (Abrams), Red Night and Light of the Moon & Other Stories by Hanawa Kazuichi (Breakdown Press/Mansion Press), Holy Lacrimony by Michael DeForge (D&Q), Paul Auster’s New York Trilogy by Paul Karasik, Lorenzo Mattotti & David Mazzucchelli (Pantheon), Cornelius: The Merry Life of a Wretched Dog by Marc Torices (D&Q), Barnaby, Volume 5 by Crockett Johnson (Fantagraphics), The Art of Milt Gross, Volume 1 by Paul C. Tumey (Erratic Press), The Cabbie, Vols. 1&2 by Marti (Fantagraphics), The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco (Metropolitan Books), Alienation: Final Cut by Inés Estrada (Floating World), Brain Damage by Shintaro Kago (Fantagraphics) *** (articles) (top) 2025 was a hell of a time. The year in which America descended into a fascist government also turned out to be the strongest year for comics in recent memory, and certainly in the time I’ve been writing about them. Who knows: maybe that old canard about bad times producing good art might have something to it after all. In any case, a brief listing of some of the year’s superlatives: Most Cascading Dominos Due to an Industry Bankruptcy: Diamond Comic Distributors Inc. Seediest Self-Immolation of a Longstanding Comics Institution: Angoulême Comics Festival Best Republication of a Near-Forgotten Manga Classic: Drawn and Quarterly’s new collection of Shirato Sanpei’s The Legend of Kamui Most Predictable Aborted Retirement From Superhero Comics: Grant Morrison Most Alarming Looming Possibility for Corporate Interference: David and Larry Ellison’s bid to purchase DC Comics owner Warner Bros. Discovery. Five Best Books of 2025 The Once and Future Riot by Joe Sacco. Sacco’s latest (and supposedly last, for a time) work of journalistic cartooning is also his best since 1996’s Palestine. It’s also an unexpectedly relevant, if not to say prophetic, commentary on the nature of violence and democracy in action. My pick for the best book of the year. Do Admit: The Mitford Sisters and Me by Mimi Pond. Speaking of unexpectedly relevant commentaries on fascist eras. Mimi Pond’s vibrant, funny biography of the celebrated British sisters is more joyous and enjoyable than it has any right to be. Pond has been working for decades, mostly under the radar, but if this is the book that finally makes hers a name to reckon with it will be well-earned. Black Arms to Hold You Up: A History of Black Resistance by Ben Passmore. Passmore’s passionate, unflinching look at a century of revolutionary defiance against racial oppression is often grim but never bleak: its underlying theme is one of hope, and a confidence that silence is the one thing no amount of tyranny or apartheid can ever fully achieve. Boy, I do seem to be going heavy on the historical nonfiction this year, don’t I? Maybe it’s the tenor of the times. Better liven things up with something fanciful. Batman and Robin: Year One by Mark Waid and Chris Samnee. Am I cheating by shoehorning a mainstream superhero comic onto this list? Absolutely. Is it legitimately better, on an objectively literary level, than, say, World Within the World by Julia Gfrörer or Tedward by Josh Pettinger, both of which my arbitrary cap of five entries prevented me from including? It is not. But it was as delightful and true a distillation of the mainstream superhero ethos as one could hope for; Mark Waid (having been unleashed at last on his proper home of DC Comics after a decade in exile) is at the top of his game; and Chris Samnee remains an artist incapable of making an unnecessary pencil stroke. I liked it. Existential Comics: Selected Stories 1979-2004 by R. Crumb. Like most sensible critics, I have ambivalent feelings about Robert Crumb. His new floppy of original material this year, Tales of Paranoia, was a reminder of the sort of unreconstructedly retrograde and paranoid worldview Crumb has always embodied (his continued adherence to anti-vax conspiracies was, alas, predictable). But this Dan Nadel-edited collection of some of Crumb’s most outstanding comics is a reminder of the other side of that personality — the originality, lack of apology, and phenomenal artistic versatility that has always made R. Crumb inimitable in his field. The book is wonderful and troubling, as an underground ought to be. *** (articles) (top) Paul Jon Milne / Suture At first sight I thought, “won't get arsed by Milne throwing out a comic with a flying v(agina) flanged upon”, but I confused it with an angelic shape, which avowedly happens a lot to me. The author's topping last year's triple efforts of Creep Heap 2025, Limit Formation Initial, and These Aren't My Brutes, with his telling of an epic of Frankensteinian proportions, wherein a creature might suffer alone by getting its parts together. Palpable the pain it went through when being subject to crazy bio engineers trying to conquer soil they're not rooted in, empathized on the total alienation felt, while following fascinated a setting staged in a way only Milne is capable of, thanks to his unique graphic skills powering his narration. Furthermore I was dead sure he created the impressive coloring with crayons, but he corrected me, when I asked him on Bluesky about it: “the 'big' pages were often coloured with felt pens or acrylic paint, or both, but the bulk of it's mostly just flat photoshop colours. I liked using felt pens, they were my favourite pages. They run out fast though, would like to colour a whole comic with them at some point but I need to buy more ... used too-bright lightbox for the felt pen layers, which often didn't give me a clear impression of the colours or the shapes at all, so I just winged it and had fun, and I liked the results.” Such is Paul, a modest and gentle man. Ingrīda Pičukāne / Feminae Explorarum (kuš!) A fascinating collection of former published musings on fashion, colors, and French (the language), where women do what they're supposed to do: not suffering, picking mushrooms while moving through the woods like they're catwalking a fashion editorial, sending drunkards to a voyage on a river like Frankenstein's creature was about to do before Whale had to cut it out, flooding the world with rivers of menstrual blood, and so on. James Corcoran / Stramash 63 (self-published, Kickstarter) Hard knocks, but are you ruff enuff, dog lovers? This is a kind of sequel to the first three Stramash issues, and the plotting does plant the evil that men do in different ages, but bloodshed knows no history, except for chronicler James Corcoran, with support on colo(u)rs by Colin Bell. If you're into PI stuff, the classic way, but with a sense of wonder, this is your joint. The broad-brush henchmen in this are overtly ghastly, just sayin. Deniz Camp, Javier Rodríguez / Absolute Martian Manhunter (National Periodical) Vertigo'd: Right now I have no knowledge of any series that's pulling the rug from under your feet in a more effective way, and I dunno why you have to resurrect a label like Vertigo – which should be left dead for good – especially, if your portfolio features series like AMM, the fantastic Kryptonite Spectrum mini by the Ice Cream Man weirdos, or what Zatannic Panic could've been, if it would've went more in the body horror direction the Plastic Man story featured solely chose. Gerry Duggan, Kelvin Mao, Robert Windom, Jae Lee, June Chung / This Ends Tonight (Image) Three's a charm, or three story lines being interwoven while colliding at different time stamps: And I say Bill Everett's the forefather or -mother to Jae Lee's Namor and ~ita plus everything that followed. Just check the faces of the submariner and especially the fighting girls portrayed by Everett every now and then and compare those to the protas in This Ends Tonight, the energy generated by the artwork is of a kinetic kind rarely seen elsewhere, maybe in L'Intervista by Manuele Fior, or La Guerre by Thomas Cadène and Loïc Sécheresse. From a majority of the team that brought you Seven Sons. Liam Sharp et al /The Savage Sword of Conan #8 (Titan) Sharp as a sword: Like in the days of Doré, Foster, or Raymond, magazine's like that are the main justification for print's existence, because digital does the stellar artwork of one Liam Sharp no justice at all. Its overwhelming effect is reminiscent of that time when you were opening your first Planet of The Apes mag to discover Mike Ploog's and Tom Sutton's filigree black and white contributions to Terror On The Planet Of The Apes, and of course, and because it's so obvious, we'll have to squeeze Barry Windsor-Smith in here, too. There's a full issue done by Sharp, the eleventh, but I didn't manage to read it by now, because I have a life. But I bet it's overwhelming. Various / Back Issue #157: Keith Giffen tribute (TwoMorrows Publications) Excerpt from an interview, that drove me to tears: CADIGAN: Was that the one time in your career when you put your heart and soul into your work more so than any other? GIFFEN: I always try to throw 100 percent of myself into the work, but I guess the Legion thing, there was a little bit more in there, a little bit more in terms of what I really wanted to do in terms of storytelling and tone in a book. Yeah, I guess that was. Out of all the work I'd done for DC up until that point, yeah, Legion was the book that I put that little bit of extra into-the "Five Years Later." Lina Müller, Luca Schenardi / Plant Based Monster Trucks (Nieves) The one wherein I asked the question “Now, what's your stance on comics”, and identified as a latitudinarian. Yvan Alagbé / The Midnight Traveler ; Le Voyageur (Èditions Adverse) An excerpt from an upcoming meditation on the colonial phantoms still ruling over white minds: “That for his 2025 release The Midnight Traveler Yvan Alagbé chose the most odd of all the otherwise loincloth-sporting gents, who, if not dressed in a costume, obviously goes by the name of Kit Walker, might be due to the myth behind the seemingly immortal man, because the Phantom job gets passed on from father to son when cracking with old age. Le Voyageur, an essayist pamphlet leporello initially created for the Italian edition of Yellow Negroes, or, as the legend goes, *hidden in it*, and republished just this autumn by one of the French publishing houses most dedicated to the art of bookbindery, Éditions Adverse, presents jungle plagiarism and fumetti neri italiani pastiche galore, a meta-textual retelling of the relationships between black and white, readable as an allegory on the depiction of people of color still held hostage in territories of white fantasy. 't was created by a certain Démoniak, who also published a four part mini series named Eros negro (jouer avec le feu), which translates as Black Desire (Playing with Fire).” sleepyhouse2 / hard core drugs (self-published, online) The online cmcs dept. update for 2025: Maxim Peter Griffin continues to run on full steam, while Tym Godek's motor seemingly started stuttering a bit, but nonetheless provided us with insights on the dynamics developing between love and charismARTic, as did Derek M. Ballard on the daily fight of a bringing-up father; the latter both having new print manifestations on their hands; Tym Godek at Domino, and Dr. Ballard at Adventure Time. MEANWHILE, sleepyhouse2 entered the scene. Her web comic hard core drugs, running on Bluesky and Tumblr – as every good comic should – visually evokes a German comic strip series from the 1950s, Manfred Schmidt's Nick Knatterton, a parody intentionally born out of its creator's wishes to drag the idiocy of comics into the limelight after reading an issue of Superman, but unfortunately spotlighted said idiocy in such brightness, that soon it began to outshine the stars, and finally became one itself. Add some Clamp-influenced manga shizzle, ca. Clover, to the concept, and you get a drug dramedy of its very own kind, by diving into the realms of addiction and self-exploitation. But what I love the most about it, is its recurring use of German and Yiddish, the latter in a kinship with the German language, which makes the association with Nick Knatterton a tad obvious, nicht wahr? *** (articles) (top) 1. Monsieur Chouette, David B, L'Association This is a tale about the nature of fear, the imagination and the afterlife. It's also the best thing David B has done since Epileptic. BUT: After 35 years, the trailblazing L'Association risks extinction due to production/transport costs, the squeeze on indie bookstores and the huge amount of well-publicized competition from big BD publishers. I urge you to join as a member (benefits include a discount their on their 800+ work catalogue, which gave you Epileptic, Persepolis and Emmanuel Guibert's Alan's War). Or just make a small contribution here. 2. Béla sans monde, Simon Roussin, Editions 2042 Roussin is one of today's most original artists. This is psychedelia beyond psychedelia, with poetic storytelling and specially-printed, fluorescent pages. Gorgeous and hallucinatory. 3. An Illustrated Treasury of Russian Curses, Ass Edition (жопа), Pollard & Kuznetsova Canadian cartoonist Jess Pollard and journalist Elmira Kuznetsova turn мат, Russia's age-old art of cursing into English counterparts with matching cartoons. Their work is now a globally popular, five-book series. (I'm a Russian student, but you don't have to be.) All volumes come as E-books; not recommended for kids, unless they're kids who want to shock immigrant parents. In 2026, also look for Pollard's upcoming It's Just Crabs, "a tragic tale of crab evolution". 4. Le repaire de la Meduse, Brecht Evens, Actes Sud BD/ Musée Thomas Henry The French/English catalogue of a museum show (the cover unfolds into a two-sided artwork) that featured Evens' work with Atelier Michael Woolworth. In it, the artist discusses visual language, his artistic partnership and different forms of printing, alongside special pages from his exceptional, ongoing Le Roi Meduse ("The Jellyfish King"). 5. Marseille tatouée ("Marseille tattooed"), group work, Éditions Fotokino A great idea, beautifully executed by some favorite folks: Annabelle Perrin, Nine Antico, Bonnefrite, Cagne Canine and Simon Roussin. Artists asked residents of Marseille about their tattoos, then drew the speakers. A special mention also for Nine Antico's 2025 album Une Obsession (Dargaud). 6. L'Enquete qui Pietinait ("The Stalled Investigation"), Benoit Jacques, Benoit Jacques Books A 32-page parody of a police procedural in the simple form of a newsprint paper. Matchless silliness and hilarity from of my all-time favorite artists. Helped make my year. 7. Smoke Signals, Gary Panter, Desert Island, Brooklyn Another newsprint gem; more people should be drawing and printing these! Newsprint has a great comic history; use it more! 8. Vu de L'Atlantique, Serge Clerc, Éditions Barbier L'Atlantic is one of several bars Clerc frequented during a couple of difficult years. This contains his sketchbook from the time, with everything he sketched and overheard. All the art is in his signature angular, retro style and page 180 has one of the best bar stories I've ever heard. 9. Signé Coco, Les Arènes, Corinne "Coco" Rey A nice fat collection of cartoons by Coco, a true pioneer (and not because of her sex). Organized by theme and containing the Charlie Hebdo cover Coco drew after the Nov. 13 massacres: the spirit of French cartooning in an image. 10. Les Oiseaux, Noam Courtois, Brigitte Boulent Editions 2025 Noam, who was seven-and-a-half during the Covid quarantine, kept himself occupied by drawing birds. This is a collection of them published by his grandmother. No one sees like kids. *** (articles) (top) Res ipsa loquitur “Cast” (Hagai Palevsky, Aaron Losty, Marissa Louise, Claire Napier, Self-Published). A wind-up gag, the type of joke in which the build-up to the punchline becomes the actual subject, is very hard to do right; it requires a dozen tiny variations on the same thing, a slow rising of the stakes, each one functioning as a joke by itself. “Cast” is a near-perfect example of such a gag, building its sixteen pages ever upwards until one almost reaches the heaven (that is both figurative and literal in this case) Last Summer at Camp Righteous (Ollie Hicks, Good Comics). A continuation of Hicks’ usual themes (Americana, religious hypocrisy, fucking) that never fail to entertain. There’s a knife-edge balance to these characters, who can both caricatures and people at the same time. Nap Comix (Rachel Smith, self-published). Kids say the darndest things. Crickets #9 (Sammy Harkham, Breakdown Press). The best part of Blood of the Virgin was the cowboy actor story (the one in color); so it’s nice to see Harkham surrendering to popular demand and doing another cowboy story in living color. This issue starts in a more traditional manner before going to Looney Tunes territory for its (extremely long, extremely satisfying) climax. No need to read any previous entries, or even follow the plot that heard, just sit back and enjoy world-class cartooning. Judge Dredd: And To the Sea Return (Rob Williams, Henry Flint, Annie Parkhouse, Rebellion). I wasn’t quite as keen on this story as some of the previous Judge Dredd "epics" (which are thankfully still rather short), never the most subtle of strips but he can certainly make the implicit into the explicit one time too many. Still … any excuse to see Henry Flint make another showcase of himself. You find yourself wondering why the American market didn’t try to poach him and thankful he isn’t misused on some terrible superhero story. A rare talent that started great and just keeps getting better. “Duke Ellington on Mars” (Michael D. Kennedy, Drawn &amp; Quarterly). The rest of Kennedy’s 2025 collection of comics, Milk White Steed, swings between ‘very good’ to ‘very very good’ but this short story is outright great. Pure comics poetry, as ridiculous as it is sublime. Red Night (Hanawa Kazuichi, translated by Ryan Holmberg, Breakdown Press). This book is gross, sick, violent, pornographic, morally reprehensible, visually nauseating, intellectually confused, physically painful (it gave me a paper cut) … god help me, I loved it. Legend of Kamui (Shirato Sanpei, translated by Richard Rubinger, Noriko Rubinger, Alexa Frank, Drawn and Quarterly). Shirato Sanpei’s massive historical saga seems like the stuff cliches are made of, but it is simply because you are looking at the pure source of these cliches. And, of course, everything that you think you know of historical manga, the kind that glorified battle and the bravery of the samurai, is best forgotten about. Sanpei casts his net wide as he chronicles the life of the rich and the poor, the noble and the worker, the great and the small … the only weakness one could point to is that the net is sometimes too wide — with the cast of characters becoming as complex as that of a Tolstoy novel. Would that all works would make such complaints necessary. “Zorn’s Lemma” (Chloe, self-published). A new work by Chloe that is like a Jazz standard run through the thematic obsession of an early grindcore album. Not sure if its aiming at John Zorn but it is the closest a comic book (or probably any other non-music medium) came close to aping the sensation of listening to Naked City for the first time. World Within the World: Collected Minicomix and Short Works 2010-2022 (Julia Gfrörer, Fantagraphics). The most striking things about this collection is: a) that Julia Gfrörer is only with us since 2010, since the impact of her work is so crushing you just assume she'd been there long before; B) even when doing stuff that reads like a typical webcomics gag (what is Fraser met Akira?) her pencils and attitude give the whole thing a sharp sensation that raises above the obviousness of the gag. That’s her work, a small knife so sharp you fail to notice you’ve been stabbed until you look down and see the pool of blood. *** (articles) (top) As I write this it is nearly Christmas 2025. This year, like every year, I look back and get bad feelings in the pit of my stomach about all the books I didn’t read and all the cons I didn’t table. Then I get an email, asking me for my list of favorite reads of the year and I feel like a phony. I imagine a cartoonist Christmas office party, I am standing behind the monstera as much, as it allows, with any luck I won’t get noticed. Then I think of what I draw and realise that won’t happen. The following books are titles I read this year, which really spoke to me with their expressions of visceral existence, humanity, whimsy and draughtsmanship. I enjoyed them all very much. Help!, Ethan Llewellyn and Francis Todd, Self-Published Filth, Underground Kingdom Comix Anthology, artists: Mat Greaves, Vincent Bell, Robertson, @__Threesix, steven Harper, Olly telling, Struan Sloan, Matt Simmons, Adam Falp, covers: Ethan Llewellyn, Kai Reynolds, Harry Deane Willmott, Francis Todd Tedward, Josh Pettinger, Fantagraphics 2x, Carol Swain, Dark and Golden Books The Devil’s Grin Book One, Alex Graham, Fantagraphics Astorial Compendium of Short Stories featuring Tamblyn the Secret Architect, Ed Pinsent, Self Published Worms, Book the Second, Erika Price, self published I will now release my koala death grip on the monstera, tell myself I can be a normal person who talks to folks; I did read some great work this year and table at some lovely places. I am VERY lucky to be in such great company and have their work in my life. *** (articles) (top) Punica Fides. A new book by one of the greatest Italian artists active today. It tells the story of a city in ruins, where the population is fighting in a never-ending conflict within itself and with the authorities. Bruno’s imagery is intense and dark, soaked in dense black inks. Bruno is a pure comic artist, one who never compromises his vision. The JoJolands. Many years after the last time I read anything from JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, this new installment brought me back to Hirohiko Araki’s work. He probably has already invented and done everything he had to, but after nine series the madness of this series and the super dynamic art is still so exhilarating. I’m collecting the Japanese edition, which looks beautiful. Penguin Gohan. In Your In Face Comix, a very courageous small Italian publisher has released a collection of short stories by Shigesato Itoi and Terry King, the master of heta-uma, and I couldn’t be happier. The craziest stuff you could ever come across, still looking so fresh and avant-garde after over 40 years. Still from the same publisher, I also had the chance to read a collection of shorts by Kazuichi Hanawa from the 70s, entitled Chiaro di Luna, who some may remember for his autobiographical Doing Time. His fiction is disturbing and deeply fascinating. Les moutons veulent du sel, a graphic novel by my friend Emanuele Cantoro, published in France by Ça et Là, tells the story of a child growing up on the outskirts of Rome who finds a form of salvation through nature and a flock of sheep. Cantoro’s art is spontaneous and strikingly fresh. Monsieur Chouette. The new graphic novel by Monsieur David B (in France by L’Association and in Italy by Sigaretten with the title Signor Civetta) is a wild, oneiric journey into the land of the dead, somewhere between the Divine Comedy and Alice in Wonderland. The book is a thick, visionary, funny, and unsettling experience. Takemitsu Zamurai and Nihon no Kyōdai. Two manga by Taiyo Matsumoto were published in Italy this year. Both are relatively old works and very different from each other. Takemitsu Zamurai (originally published in Japan between 2005 and 2009, in Italy by Edizioni BD/J-Pop Manga) is a slow, dreamlike samurai story with mesmerizing artwork, while Nihon no Kyōdai (in Italy by Coconino Press) is a collection of stories from the early 1990s that tell you what Matsumoto was going to become in the future and at the same time almost feel as if they could have appeared in Garo in the 1970s. My Friend Kim Jong Un, a thoroughly researched and very entertaining book on the history of the Korean Peninsula, confirms once again the talent of Keum Suk Gendry-Kim, one of the most brilliant cartoonists working today. I live how her comics can be so many things at the same time: funny, intelligent, grotesque, delicate, and so much alive, just like her smooth and fascinating art. I’ve read the Italian edition by Bao Publishing, while in France the book is available from Futuropolis and in English soon by Drawn & Quarterly. The short-story collection The Green Hand and Other Stories by Nicole Claveloux was finally published in Italian by Eris Edizioni (available in English by New York Review Comics, 2022), and a major exhibition dedicated to her work was held in my hometown, Bologna, during the A occhi aperti festival. Claveloux was part of the French comics new wave of the late 1970s and '80s, blending psychedelic atmospheres with highly technical, Topor-inspired drawing. Reading her work pushed me into a '70s trip, collecting old issues of classic French magazines like Charlie and, of course, Métal Hurlant. I also discovered the work of Lika Nüssli from Switzerland — amazing artist and wonderful person — and returned to old sentimental sports manga by Mitsuru Adachi, as well as early issues of Rumiko Takahashi’s Ranma ½. I’ve recently picked up the new Crickets by Sammy Harkham and Gary Panter’s Smoke Signal. I haven’t read the collection Tongues by Anders Nilsen (which I expect to see mentioned often on this page), just because I am already collecting the series (which I hope to see in Italy soon, hopefully translated by me, just like Big Questions). Toward the end of the year, Canicola delighted Italian readers with two books I had been eagerly waiting for: the dreamy and stylish Il sogno della cicala by Dario Sostegni and Raffaele Sorrentino, and Il bus incantato, a true story from Iran told by the very talented Majid Bita. And then, a big shout-out to all the good comics I forgot to mention. *** (articles) (top) Favorite books of 2025 … Frankly, I still have a huge pile of more than 30 unread books beside my bed! I also skipped talking about all the small press gems that I gathered this year in Montreal, Toronto and Rome. So here goes: a mixture of English and French, some familiar to the Comics Journal readership and some secret gems for the more curious and audacious readers out there. Books whose design and format transcend the norm; where the artist went further and farther to produce a cross between a graphic novel and an art book/object. These books are usually treasured for a long time and 2025 produced a lot. Goes Like This, Jordan Crane, Fantagraphics Books I have every comic book Jordan Crane ever did and I probably have already seen all the material in this compilation but WOW! When I got a hold of this book and flipped through it, the beauty of the design, from the texture of the paper to the the printing and the spine, knocked me out. It is just an incredibly beautiful book that showcases the advance in printing technics. Granted, it’s not cheap! It’s a must for anybody interested in that type of art book/graphic novel hybrid that rises above all the others. Thank you Fantagraphics for taking risks and producing such gems. Tongues Vol. 1, Anders Nilsen, Pantheon Books Over the years I did buy from Nilsen at TCAF a few of the individual chapters but when this volume came out, I was curious to see if it was going to include the cut out pages and all the little extras that cost a fortune to print and is usually reserved for shorter hand assembled print runs. Well, Pantheon did an amazingly fateful job on this one. L’infiniment moyen et plus si infinités dans les limites finies d’une édition minimaliste, Marc-Antoine Mathieu, Delcourt I don’t think any of his boundary pushing work has been translated in English, am I wrong? All of his books are narrative experiments, and Mathieu manages each time to produce a theatrical experience within the pages of his graphic novels. So far, he’s included cut out panels, a pop-up, conceptual stories where for example, you begin that story in the middle, a story that takes place within seconds. This artist challenges himself at every opportunity. His latest is very cheeky. Using a magnifying glass, he drew as small as he could an 82 pages story fitting in a one inch book that is packaged with a magnifying glass. Mathieu has managed to draw something even smaller than the smallest Chris Ware text! The packaging is beautiful, it’s an art object/graphic novel/high concept album. It’s also funny in a Kafka way, as the title is probably the longest ever for the tiniest graphic novel ever drawn and printed. Muséum, Eric Lambé, FRMK FRMK are know for difficult books and as ambitious as FRMK are, their books are not for the average reader of comics. They produce gorgeous books for adults interested in the combination of literature and art. Eric Lambé has had great success lately with Antipodes (Casterman), an album written by David B. that came out in 2024. In this solo outing, Lambé’s book is about what you experience and take away from a museum, images bound in sensations and feelings. Lambé manages to create a playful narrative, sometimes abstract, sometimes surreal with very little dialogue. The work of a master. Lézards rêves, Jean Giraud Moebius, Moebius production Moebius production’s new book explores and showcases excerpts from the artist sketchbooks. It’s like discovering a caché of gems that Giraud/Moebius left behind after passing away. This book is filled with gorgeous improvised illustrations and short stories that reminds us of his mastery in fishing out striking images from his subconscious mind. The book itself is small, a beauty to hold and behold. The Moon and the Serpent Bumper Book of Magic, Alan Moore and Steve Moore, Top Shelf This reminds me of The Museum of Lost Wonder by Jeff Hoke, published by Weiser in 2006. It tackled the same subject, magic and the occult sciences, in the same way, both sharing an illuminating vision of the world of magic, explaining and putting these things in perspective. They are fun books: playful, erudite but accessible. In the case of The Moon and the Serpent, probably the last ever comics from Alan Moore. Just for that reason (but there are many more), seek it out. And a few more, in a more classical format. Bowling with Corpses, Mike Mignola, Dark Horse When I heard Mignola was doing original stories after Hellboy, I bought this book but I put it away because, somehow, I expected to be disappointed. How could he top his work with Hellboy? Well I can report that it was quite the opposite. Unshackled by the heavy mythology created for the Hellboy universe, these new stories are a breath of fresh air. Funny, whimsical and amazing page layouts, this book shows that Mignola is a master storyteller/artist and I look forward with glee to what he will uncover in this new universe that he’s created. Soozy No 1 and no 1 1/2, Seosie, self-published Okay, here’s at least one independent book from TCAF that I got it this year. New pages from Seosie were also published in Charlotte mensuel in France. It’s really difficult to illustrate sexual situations and make it cute and and funny. A lot of people still associate pleasure with violence and punishment. Not so here with Seosie. She is such a talented artist, able to paint realistic canvas and then switch to cartoony figures for these books, while her drawings are still exquisite and expressive. The French in France have already discovered her! Your turn now… Absolute Martian Manhunter, Camp and Rodriguez, DC I am not that into multiverses and superhero comic books — corporate products spiked with new sauces every few years! A good friend gave me Absolute Martian Manhunter by Camp and Rodriguez knowing I would like that one … and I did. The LSD-tinged visuals within create a really interesting narrative mixing nearly abstracts visuals and symbols within a more classic comics grid, but with a modernistic twist. A really interesting experiment by both authors within the trappings of the genre. Wishing they’ll attempt something like that someday, but in a more adult vein with their own characters.\ Tales of Paranoia, Robert Crumb, Fantagraphics books I have missed Crumb, it’s been decades since I bought one of his 32-page comic book. Here, he reminds us that he is still a master at this! His stories are rich, compact, deep and layered. More please Robert! And here we enter the French zone ... L’association strikes back! This year, as l’Association still struggles with the financial comic book bubble that is bursting in France, three founders of l’Association came out with excellent graphic novels and story collection, reminding us that they are still at the top of their creative game. Monsieur Chouette, David B., L’Association After many years, a return to a longer black and white narrative that follows two main characters as they go into hell as imagined by David B. David’s stark black and white images result in some of the most interesting and gorgeous composition within a page that I have seen in 2025. No one is more adept at balancing black and white masses and turning them into light and darkness. A work by a master storyteller. La fin du monde, Stanislas, L’Association This is a collection of short stories in a ligne claire style. It's a melt-in-your-mouth goodness though the eyes experience! A complete delight. MENU, 30/40, Jean-Christophe Menu, L’Apocalypse Comic legend and designer Etienne Robial relaunched the 30/40 collection that he used to publish at Futuropolis with an issue written and drawn by Jean-Christophe Menu. Again, Menu shows off his complete mastery of the form and proposes multiple stories, longer works on the passing of his father and mother are moving and touching, elegys from the heart. Menu also revisits past series and characters and shows that he is still one of the mort important contemporary French comic creator. Québec highlights. Distributed mostly in Quebec book shops (with a few copies shipped out to France and Belgium), most of the States and English Canada have no idea that such a vibrant community publishes really distinctive and original works in French within Canada. Once in a while Drawn and Quarterly, Conundrum Press and POW POW will translate some, but it’s just the tip of the iceberg. ROTOTO, Richard Écrapou, Monsieur ED Richard Écrapou (best know as Richard Suicide), winner in 2015 of the best Québec graphic novel, has been illustrating books for kids for quite some time with great success. This is the first time Richard, who is know in Quebec comics for his writing stye for adults, tackles his first kids story by himself. What you wind up is kinda of an artists book for kids, in the vein of Françoise Mouly’s Toon Books but with a sharper and edgier vision. Libres d’Obéir, Casterman et Le Prince des Oiseaux de Haut Vol, La Pastèque, Philippe Girard Philippe Girard, who burst on the international scene with the Leonard Cohen biography, On A Wire (Drawn and Quarterly), had a stellar year in 2025. His book chronicling Antoine de St-Exupéry’s stay in Québec during world war two, and months prior to writing The Little Prince, explores where he was in his life and suggests what might have led him to writing the second most popular book of all time. This graphic novel by Philippe and the following that came out a few months after, Libre d’Obéir showcases his innovative layouts which often plays with graphics and symbols. adapted from Johann Chapoutot’s essay, it is essential to understanding our current events as it explores how the Nazi work ethics was co-opted by big corporations, from Germany to the United States. Really good adult subject matter rendered by an author reaching a peak in his career. Interludes de Courtoisie, Noémie Poulin, Moelle Graphik Three stories, weaved both symbolically and figuratively into a wordless narrative. Not quite abstract, this book somehow casts a spell: an hypnotic flow of images takes over you when you start reading. Mysterious and hard to define, an expending worldview told though images. Magical in the purest way possible, like real life can sometimes be. Filles du Roy (origines), Louis Rémillard and Dom Leblond, Septentrion Louis Rémillard is one of the first self-publishing Quebec artists who became active in the '70s. In the last few years, as he passages seventy years of age, he managed to hit his stride with richly detailed and historically accurate stories about the First Nations in Quebec and Canada. His latest, working with scriptwriter Dom Leblond, is a long term chronicle about the King’s daughters (les filles du Roy), mostly women living in poverty in France who in 1663, who were enticed to sail to the new world and settle in New France (Québec), marry and populate the French colonies. With his eye for fascinating details, Rémillard illustrates a engaging story about the trip these women undertook to get to North America. A rich, entertaining and fascinating read. Pierre Fournier: Le Capitaine Québec, Jean-Dominic Leduc, La Pastèque, Okay, at least one French book on Québec comics history. It might even be sold out by the time this list appears. Still, Jean-Dominic Leduc does an incredible job of retelling Pierre Fournier’s journey as he attempts, through the creation of comic book characters like Capitaine Kébec, to create a viable space for Quebec comics creator to thrive in the seventies and eighties. Much more than a biography, thought Fournier’s eyes, we witness how the pioneering efforts by Fournier and other like Jacques Hurtubise, played out and created the basis for what would become the modern Quebec comic book/bande dessinée Montreal scene. A fast paced fantastic read with a rich visual iconography. Spread Love Comix No. 30, edited by Uncle Gil, Spread Love Smaller than a regular comix, Spread Love has been coming out monthly for a few years now. A love letter to those underground seventies anthologies, it features a lot of new young underground comix voices like Robin Bougie and Dexter Cockburn. It usually has an interesting short interview conducted by Uncle Gil (with the likes of Dennis Kitchen and Dave Cooper) and a selection of comics that are trashy, a bit shocking to some, but in the end, it all amounts to good clean (and dirty) fun. This one is published in English.

Title: The €170bn 'resting' in Irish bank accounts

Try from €1.50 / week Try from €1.50 / week €1 in every €7 earned in Ireland is now being saved by households, underpinned by rising income and a fall in consumption. Irish households are saving money at a rate not seen since the pandemic-induced highs of the early 2020s with recent data showing the savings rate hitting the highest levels since the middle of 2022. However, much of that money languishes in deposit accounts which offer little in the way of returns for customers as inflation erodes its value. Recently released figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) shows that Irish households are continuing to add to their deposit accounts with the savings rate rising to almost 15% between July and September, up 2% from the previous quarter. The current savings rate is also notably above the average of 13.1% since the beginning of 2023. It said that €1 in €7 is now being saved by households, which is being underpinned by rising income and a fall in consumption. According to data from the Central Bank of Ireland, as of the end of October, the total value of household deposits stood at €170.3bn marking the first time in the history of the data series that this figure surpassed €170bn - an increase of €2bn compared to September and an increase of €11.3bn in the year to the end of October. Even though all categories had a positive contribution, overnight deposits - which is money largely kept in current accounts - was the main driver, reporting a positive flow of €1.9bn during the month. The CSO said that savings can add to a household's overall wealth in the form of buying new homes, growing bank deposits, pension savings, and paying off debt. Managing director of Cork-based financial planning firm Alpha Wealth Nick Charalambous said the reality is a lot of Irish depositors are “getting next to zero interest” on their savings with inflation eroding its value over time. "Don't leave your money sitting dormant in the banks, the post office, credit unions,” he said. Financial planner with Castle Capital Colum Carroll said inflation is the “real killer” of wealth and investing money, whether it be through a pension or other mechanisms, allows people to plan better for the future. "People often see investments as being risky, but I think the narrative kind of needs to change around that again…Not investing can actually be even more risky. The risk of running out of money, the risk of not having enough money in the future, or losing purchasing power. They're the kind of real risks,” he said. Mr Charalambous said a part of the reason for people keeping money on deposit or in savings is the fear of losing it and maybe a lack of understanding of the options that are out there for people to make their money work harder particularly over the medium to long term. When looking into what to do with all their savings, Mr Charalambous said households should consider the timeframe for when they need the savings as this will dictate the appropriate financial vehicle. In the short-term, which would be three years or less, he says that money should be kept on deposit. "Most of us are now used to using Revolut. With their introduction of savings and deposit rates as well as investment accounts, there are millions upon millions of euros going into those types of savings,” he said, however, there are better returns offered by other non-Irish entities. “Raisin would be my preferred one, and the main reason for that is that they use physical banks. With Raisin you can get a sort of a three month starter rate with Raisin themselves who are triple a rated institution at 3.1% gross, and typically the demand deposit rates with Raisin are in and around 2.15%,” he said. After covering expenses and managing savings for the short-term, Mr Charalambous said people should be prioritising longer-term investments such as a pension. "Unfortunately, we all live in the here and now, and it's very difficult for us to kind of visualize a scenario where we are basically benefiting from building up this very tax efficient investment vehicle, which is a pension,” he said. In the medium term, which would be four years or longer, Mr Charalambous said there are investment options from the likes of Irish Life, Aviva, and Zurich which offer “very broad investment solutions”. Mr Charalambous said all investments should be reviewed at least once a year. Given the growth of Revolut, along with other financial applications, people have become a lot more familiar with investing themselves in stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In these apps, people can choose to manage their own investments with the money being easily accessible should the customer need to make a withdrawal. However, Mr Charalambous warned that the options often offered in these apps are very concentrated and largely dependent on US stock markets. "The Vanguard S&P 500 as an example, is the most common ETF globally, where most people start with and put too much exposure to. But it's a very narrow fund, because it's concentrated purely in the US, solely in 500 companies,” he said, adding that it is largely dependent on the growth of the Magnificent Seven. “Yet we've seen gold has done spectacularly well this year. European equities have typically outperformed the US particularly if you take into account the dollar weakness that we've seen this year.” Growth in the US stock market is heavily concentrated on just a handful of companies nicknamed the Magnificent Seven - Google’s parent company Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla - which brings with it a lot of risk particularly if there is a falloff in the tech sector. Nvidia, the most valuable company in the world, has seen its stock price surge over the course of the year as tech companies scramble to buy as many of its graphics processing units (GPUs) as possible to put into data centres to power their AI models. Nvidia alone accounts for over 7% of the S&P 500. Mr Charalambous said the Vanguard S&P 500 is a “speculative type of investing” and the risk might be higher than they realise. "People typically wouldn't realize the level of risk that they may be undertaking when they go into a fund like that,” he said. Data from the Central Bank of Ireland shows the market value of Irish resident holdings of securities stood at just under €6 trillion (tn) as of the end of September - an increase of €353m over the quarter. Of this total, Irish pension funds account for €51bn while household investments account for €28.26bn. Listed shares accounted for €2.4tn of the total with the US being the primary destination for Irish resident investment in stocks accounting for 58% of the total value or €1.4tn. In comparison, the Irish stock market only accounts for 2% or €49bn, of the total money Irish investment in stocks. The surge in share valuations in the US stock market is primarily being driven by the Magnificent Seven of which many are heavily investing in AI and its supporting infrastructure, particularly data centres. However, as of yet, there has been little return on this investment for these companies and if the so-called AI bubble bursts, this could spell trouble for Irish investors who have a lot of money wrapped up in US stocks. In terms of households holdings of listed shares, it reached an all-time high during the third quarter reaching €11.5bn. However, this is largely due to the increase in the overall total market value which increased by around €700m in the quarter. During the budget in October, former finance minister Paschal Donohoe announced a reduction in the investment exit tax from 41% to 38% from January 1 which makes it a little cheaper to actually invest in ETFs or other investment products. This rate could come down in the future potentially reaching the 33% rate set for capital gains tax. Due to these tax changes, Mr Carroll said coming into 2026 it’s now “more advantageous” to invest than it has been over the last number of years because of the exit tax coming down. “Hopefully that should come down even more,” he said, adding that even if it came down to 33% it would still be quite high compared to the US and the UK. Capital gains tax is paid at 33% on the profits of the sale or disposal of certain access such as shares in a company or bonds. However, an exit tax is paid on the profit from an investment in a fund - such as an ETF - and is charged at 38%. In addition, under deemed disposal rules, that tax is liable to be paid every eight years regardless of whether the asset is sold or not. Given the lower rate of tax on holding single shares, rather than investing in broad funds, Mr Carroll said these rules do not "promote good investing”. “You get 33% if you hold a single stock which is very risky, versus holding a tiny, tiny percentage of tens of thousands of stocks all around the world, you get taxed heavily on that,” he said. "The best practice is, if you have the money now and you don't need access to it, now is the best time to invest,” he said. "Like long term investing isn't essentially risky, it's more the risk of not having enough money in the future or when you need it. If you don't have enough money to pay for your children's education fund, or you don't have enough money to retire at 65 and you need to continue to work longer than you'd hoped, that's the kind of real risk,” Mr Carroll said.

Title: Is MetaX a NVIDIA Threat—or Just Another DeepSeek Market Scare?

On Dec. 17, news broke about China-based MetaX Integrated Circuits making its public debut on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and subsequently surging by around 700%. The company—not to be confused with Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta Platforms NASDAQ: META—was founded by former Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ: AMD executives and develops general-purpose graphics processing units, or GPUs, for applications in artificial intelligence. Because of the AI-focus of its microchips, the company has drawn comparisons to NVIDIA NASDAQ: NVDA, the largest publicly traded company by market cap at $4.58 trillion. As an increasing level of global competition comes to the forefront, should shareholders be concerned about threats to NVIDIA’s dominance? On Dec. 21, CNBC reported that AI-linked IPOs in China are undergoing rapid growth, with some of the listings “delivering eye-popping gains.” One week before MetaX made its debut, another GPU designer—Moore Threads Technology—also had its IPO, with its shares gaining approximately 400% thereafter. At the same time, investors continued to rotate out of U.S.-listed tech stocks as concerns about elevated valuations, market concentration, and the specter of an AI bubble looms over the S&P 500. The MetaX news accelerated selling of NVDA, which, after hitting its all-time high in late October 2025, had fallen by more than 17% by Dec. 17 before finding its footing. For analysts and pundits, there was no shortage of correlations being drawn between MetaX’s market disruption and the one investors grappled with on Jan. 27, 2025, when news of DeepSeek—a generative AI company based in China—would present an alternative to OpenAI at comparatively attractive prices. In turn, a majority of large and mega-cap U.S. equities with any exposure to AI underwent a short-term sell-off. Within days, hundreds of billions of dollars in Magnificent Seven market cap was wiped out. But it turned out that DeepSeek, despite its low-cost models that could run training models at a fraction of the compute power as OpenAI, was a flash in the pan. Numerous issues—from government censorship and a notable security breach to slowdowns in updates and uninspiring subsequent models—saw the company’s hype die down as quickly as it arrived. Now, nearly 12 months later, the market could be seeing another iteration of that with MetaX. NVIDIA’s dominance in the broad AI landscape, and in the GPU industry in particular, is unquestioned. But importantly, when the market overreacts to newcomers—as it is prone to do—oftentimes the investors who panic-sell are the ones who suffer long term. Over the last three years, NVIDIA has delivered 11 earnings beats in the past 12 quarters. Over the same period, the company has beat on revenue estimates 12 out of 12 times. MetaX, on the other hand, continues to operate at a loss. Analysts have determined that the company’s technology lags that of mainstream competitors by two to three years. Additionally, being based in China, the company relies heavily on domestic, state-sanctioned investments, which put into question the viability of its long-term success. Compounding matters, as CNBC reported, it isn’t easy for overseas investors to partake in these rallies. According to the outlet, “foreign retail investors in particular are shut out of mainland China IPOs.” Fund manager Yang Tingwu of Tongheng Investment told Reuters that the surge in these China-based AI companies’ stock prices is very likely a run-up that will result in the markets “witnessing the stock's peak level for the next five years.” Meanwhile, NVIDIA is less than 9% removed from its all-time high, has gained nearly 1,352% over the past five years, and finds itself at the center of a circular financing network that is worth hundreds of billions of dollars. NVIDIA and its ilk are nearly cemented in strategic partnerships with other AI companies, including OpenAI—a role that the Santa Clara, Calif.-based fabless GPU company is unlikely to relinquish any time soon. The stock maintains a consensus Buy rating based on 53 analysts that cover it, with its average 12-month price target of $262.14 representing potential upside of more than 39%. Over the past year, institutional owners have been pouring money into the company to the tune of $339.17 billion compared to outflows of $116.47 billion. Another strong indication of health is that current short interest stands at just 1.13% of the float. Before you consider NVIDIA, you'll want to hear this. MarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and NVIDIA wasn't on the list.

Title: Meta Platforms Might Be the Biggest Bargain in Big Tech

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © nextheprime / Shutterstock.com Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) certainly stands out as one of the bigger “deals” to be had in big tech for those looking to play the value side of the AI trade. Undoubtedly, when it comes to the Magnificent Seven, investors might wish to be more selective with which members of the famed group they buy going into the new year. Whether that’s due to the variance in performance between the individual names, the different slates of expectations set ahead of them, or their potential to make up ground in this AI race, there are reasons to get pickier when it comes to the most magnificent names atop this market. Since it feels unlikely that the non-stop chatter about stretched stock valuations, bubbles, and all the doubts that AI can live up to its potential will pull back in the new year, investors might need to increase their tolerance for turbulence going into the new year, especially with the companies that have been spending far more than your average investor might be comfortable with. At this juncture, the higher the AI spending bar, the higher the expectations bar is likely to be in the new year, and for companies like Meta Platforms, it seems like the shares are looking relatively cheap for a reason. But what happens if there are decent returns that lie just a bit further down the road that investors and analysts can’t yet see? In such a case, shares of Meta Platforms may very well be in for more consolidation or even downside before investors come to the realization that its AI strategy is paying off, perhaps many times over. Some upbeat analysts over at Morgan Stanley seem to think that the new year could be incredibly kind to the social-media juggernaut. Notably, they see revenue re-acceleration at the hands of stronger ad demand as well as improved performance of ads at the hands of AI. Add Reels and WhatsApp business messaging momentum into the equation, and it certainly feels like 2026 will see enough of an AI return to soothe the fears of the rising tide of AI spend. Another bull, Colin Sebastian, over at Baird, also thinks 2026 could be a good year for Meta Platforms shares. He thinks new AI models (think closed-source Avocado and Mango models, as Meta Platforms moves on from its open-source LLaMA model) might help push the name to $815 per share. Undoubtedly, the sudden and surprising shift from open-source to closed-source models might be a head-scratcher for some. Either way, it seems to be the right way to go, especially given industry trends. I think Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg can deliver more than a few surprises in the new year, as the company potentially looks to give investors what they want over the near- to medium-term while also ensuring enough is spent on the long-term opportunity at hand. On the one hand, some of the bears see the firm as spending a bit too much on AI efforts. On the other hand, some skeptics might see Meta Platforms as “lagging” in the AI race. Undoubtedly, there’s room to catch up if Meta AI is to catch up to the likes of the current leaders. Either way, it’s just too easy to be bearish on the stock right here. And that’s why the stage might be set for a big rally that helps shares catch up to the rest of the Mag Seven after a rough, but still positive (shares up 11% year to date) year. At the time of this writing, Meta Platforms’ shares are going for 22.1 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E). That’s the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven, thanks in part to the nasty decline the stock encountered back in October. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Title: Top 10 SaaStr AI Predictions for 2026
URL: https://www.saastr.com/top-10-saastr-ai-predictions-for-2026/
Time Published: 2025-12-25T16:10:30Z
Full Content:
by Jason Lemkin | Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blog Posts, SaaStr.Ai So we decided to do something fun this year and write up our 2026 predictions together with every single SaaStr speaker and AI post of the year! How? Every single SaaStr AI session, interview and speaker was ingested into Claude so we worked the Top 10 for 2026 up … together. Our Top 10 Predictions for B2B + AI for 2026: The Prediction: AI-native B2B companies will run sales teams that are 50% smaller than their predecessors while maintaining or increasing revenue. The Evidence: At SaaStr, we’re already seeing this play out. We deployed an AI BDR that created 25% of our new pipeline in just 90 days. One leading AI dev tools company just closed a $4M+ annual deal where the Sales Engineer ran the entire relationship—the sales team’s only contribution was helping price the deal. What the data shows: The shift: The traditional “WFH mid-pack inside sales rep” faces extinction. The survivors will be: Sources: ICONIQ Growth GTM Benchmarking Study 2025; SaaStr AI Agent Deployment Data; Replit Head of Sales Engineering (conversation); SaaStr internal pipeline data The Prediction: The highest-performing B2B companies will have AI agents handling 40-60% of initial prospect and customer interactions by the end of the year. or at least on that path. The Evidence: At SaaStr, we now have more AIs than humans. We deployed 20+ agents across outbound sales, inbound, support, and operations—generating over $1M in direct revenue and handling 15,000+ messages in 100 days with 5-7% response rates (vs. 2-4% industry average). What’s working: The reality check: This isn’t “set and forget.” Managing agents now consumes 30% of our Chief AI Officer’s time. But the companies that figure this out in 2025 will have a massive operational advantage by 2026. As Wade Foster (CEO, Zapier) puts it: “The agent is basically doing 90 plus percent of the work and leaves the last mile to the account rep to make it happen.” That’s the hybrid model that works—AI for volume, humans for the critical last mile. Sources: SaaStr AI Agent Playbook (saastr.com); Amélie Lerutte, Chief AI Officer at SaaStr; Wade Foster, CEO Zapier; Qualified AI deployment data; Artisan campaign metrics The Prediction: By end of 2026, the majority of internal business applications and MVPs will be built through natural language prompts rather than traditional development. Not necessarily for production-grade apps, but everything up to that point. The Evidence: The numbers are unprecedented: I’ve personally built 9+ production apps on Replit with 750,000+ total uses, including financial modeling tools, content systems, and startup simulation games—all without writing traditional code. The breakthrough: After 100+ days of “vibe coding,” I achieved what I call “Replit Fluency”—the ability to see any app I want to build in my head and know exactly how to prompt it to production. This state is reachable by anyone willing to invest the learning curve. The market size: Based on current trajectories, the vibe coding TAM could reach $150-400B by 2030.

The Evidence: The math is brutal: From 2012-2023, nearly every SaaStr Fund portfolio company crossing $20M ARR with solid fundamentals received multiple PE offers. That’s not happening anymore. The middle-tier SaaS companies are stuck. What to do: Get profitable, optimize for cash flow over ARR growth, extend runway to 2026-2027, and focus on fundamentals (NRR >100%, gross margins >75%, Rule of 40+). Sources: ICONIQ venture data; SaaStr Fund I portfolio experience; Meritech Capital SaaStr Annual presentation; PE deal data (Thoma Bravo, Vista Equity, Clearlake) The Prediction: Leading AI companies will achieve 65-75% gross margins, fundamentally changing the “AI is expensive” narrative. The Evidence: OpenAI’s compute margin hit 70% in October 2025—up from 35% in January 2024. They doubled margin efficiency in less than two years. What’s driving it: The catch for startups: Competition raises the bar as fast as costs fall. One SaaStr Fund portfolio company at $100M ARR is adding $6M in inference costs next year—not because their product is broken, but to leapfrog competition. The treadmill never stops. Have AI Gross Margins Really Turned the Corner? The Real Math Behind OpenAI’s 70% Compute Margin — And Why B2B Startups Are Still Running on a Treadmill Sources: OpenAI compute margin data (The Information); Token cost analysis; SaaStr Fund portfolio company data; Mary Meeker AI Report The Prediction: Companies will transform support from a $2M cost center to a $500K profit center using AI agents. The Evidence: Gorgias deployed AI customer service to 500+ brands achieving: Their AI agents now handle 2.4 million automated interactions monthly, charging $1 per interaction while spending ~$0.22-0.23 on LLM costs. The bigger opportunity: The Shopping Assistant is driving 3-8% sales lift for merchants. Stores are choosing to keep AI live full-time instead of staffing human chat. Support is becoming a revenue driver. What’s required: Sources: Gorgias AI deployment data; Gorgias “30 in 30” program; Qualified AI support metrics; Intercom Fin deployment results (Paul Adams, CPO) The Prediction: Most AI companies will shift from pure seat-based pricing to token markup or hybrid models with seats + inference. The Evidence: Cursor’s pricing backlash exposed a fundamental problem: 5% of power users can consume 80% of compute costs, making per-seat pricing unsustainable. The new models emerging: Why this is inevitable: The industry shift: When your entire business model depends on marking up someone else’s tokens, you’re vulnerable to upstream pricing decisions. The sustainable companies will build genuine software value on top. Sources: Cursor pricing analysis; Jared Palmer (Vercel) on model costs; Oscar Le (token markup thesis); SaaS pricing research The Prediction: Multiple $50B+ IPOs from AI and AI-native companies, dwarfing 2021. The candidates: What’s different from 2021: The math: Databricks at $5B ARR growing 55% could command $80-100B. Anthropic could be the largest tech IPO ever. If it doesn’t go out in 2026, Stripe might be #1. Sources: Databricks financial data; Stripe revenue reports; Ramp growth data; Rippling product expansion; IPO market analysis The Prediction: The efficiency gap between AI-native and traditional companies will become insurmountable. The Evidence: At SaaStr: We now run an eight-figure business with single-digit headcount and 20+ AI agents. We went from 20+ human employees to 3 humans plus 20+ agents while maintaining revenue scale. What this means for hiring: The competitive implication: When your competitor operates with 30% fewer GTM headcount and 40% better unit economics, that’s not a sustainable disadvantage. Sources: Cursor employee data; Bessemer State of AI 2025 (AI Supernovas vs. Shooting Stars); SaaStr operational data; Lovable team size The Prediction: Either OpenAI or Anthropic will reach $1 trillion valuation by end of 2026. The Evidence: As Rory O’Driscoll noted in the 20VC year-end review: Anthropic’s “growth rate is faster than OpenAI, valuation convergence even after OpenAI’s potential new round at $800B… Dario’s cranked out the ‘I’m going to get profitable, I’m going to be sensible.’ If you own those stocks at the start of the year, this is the stock you’d feel most excited about.” What gets them there: The wild card: At least one major AI company may have a significant down round. Private market valuations are unsustainable for many players. Sources: OpenAI revenue data (The Information); Anthropic valuation reports; Mary Meeker/Bond Capital AI Trends Report; ChatGPT usage metrics Every one of these predictions points to the same conclusion: This technology cycle is moving faster than anything in human history. The companies that adapt quickest will capture disproportionate value. Those that wait for “certainty” will find themselves competing against AI-native challengers with 10x productivity advantages. You know this. The question isn’t whether AI will transform your business—it’s whether you’ll lead that transformation or be disrupted by it. 2025 was your very last chance to mostly … watch. And maybe just launch a co-pilot.

Title: The best video essays of 2025 | Sight and Sound
URL: https://www.bfi.org.uk/sight-and-sound/polls/best-video-essays-2025
Time Published: 2025-12-25T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
Now in its ninth year, our annual poll showcases 255 vital video essays, nominated by 72 international voters. The ninth instalment of Sight and Sound’s dedicated poll has brought a record number of participants (72) and video essays (255) mentioned. While the video essay form still escapes definition, and is no longer new or ‘the next big thing’, this data attests that the number and diversity of stakeholders willing to engage with it – creators, critics, scholars, curators, programmers, fans – continues to grow. This year’s poll has moved somewhat closer to parity between three major ecosystems of video essays: (1) academia and film/media criticism (34 voters, 94 distinct video essays mentioned), (2) festivals, museums, and galleries (17 voters, 65 essays mentioned), and (3) social media and YouTube (21 voters, 96 essays mentioned). Perhaps not surprisingly, there is little overlap in what each ecosystem mentions, except among contributors working across more than one sphere. A more interesting question raised by the poll is: which essays get seen and awarded prestige within these circles, by whom, and in what contexts? One of the key concerns resonating across the fields is accessibility. Many contributors emphasised that it was simply impossible to keep up with the gargantuan number of essays screened or published throughout the year. Others argued that seven choices were too few and applied selective parameters, such as not voting for video essays that weren’t published or available online. Such rules, while perfectly justifiable for academia, would make little sense for the art world, since online availability is a no-go for most major festival committees. Moreover, being published online in a respected peer-reviewed journal doesn’t guarantee visibility. Even the most successful scholarly video essays in this poll have relatively low view numbers. We may attribute this to increasing specialisation and fragmentation, the decline of Vimeo (still the main platform for videographic criticism), and a general lack of time and energy amid today’s precarious ‘dark academia’. Yet in the world of YouTube, these numbers would likely prevent voters from even considering such works. In this environment of overabundance, uneven availability, and dispersed notions of quality, we naturally gravitate towards what is closest: an essay encountered at a workshop or festival, one tied to a project we follow, or one that surfaces in our personalised feeds. This approach is, given the circumstances, perfectly understandable – some may even call it a survival strategy. But we should also consider whether this economy of personal connections, chance encounters, and algorithmic offerings sacrifices something essential: debate within a shared context. Within each of the three ecosystems, several trends emerge. In the academic/critical sphere, interest in archival and historiographic approaches continues to grow, building on 2024. As voter Alison Peirse notes, ‘videographic criticism is feeling its archival fantasy’. Definitions of what qualifies as archival may vary, but such works were among this year’s most frequently cited. These include the poll’s most-voted essay, The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková (12 votes), and the special issue ‘Audiovisual Approaches and the Archive’ edited by John Gibbs for the journal Movie (11 votes across three essays). One might also argue that another popular special issue, ‘The Personal Mediascape in the Age of Videographic Heterotopias’ edited by Joel Burges and Allison Cooper (11 votes across five essays), carries certain archival inflections. Horror remains a favoured genre, with Peirse herself functioning almost as an archivist of horror tropes (gaining 7 votes across her works), and Lucy Fife Donaldson’s (dis)Orientating Horror: Feeling Queerly, published in the Monstrum special issue ‘Queer/ing Horror’ (ed. Dayna McLeod), receiving 6 votes. Within the art circuit, several voters stressed the importance of where video essays are watched. Dmitry Frolov, echoing Julian Ross’s categorisation ‘essay films = video essays’, argues that cinemas and contemporary art spaces offer ‘a more immersive encounter with essayistic thought’ – an encounter he sees as increasingly difficult, and thus ‘all the more precious’, in a world ‘whose condition increasingly resembles a catastrophe’. The most-voted work in this ecosystem, Daria’s Night Flowers by Maryam Tafakory (6 votes), exemplifies this immersive experience, and speaks to Tafakory’s enduring cross-sector appeal despite her films often remaining offline years after their premieres. Frolov’s sense of catastrophe also resonates with the prominence of works focusing on Palestine, notably happiness by Fırat Yücel and The Flowers Stand Silently, Witnessing by Theo Panagopoulos. On YouTube, the works receiving the most recognition were those tackling pressing contemporary issues in a critical yet highly personal mode. Greater self-reflexivity may echo what Jacob Geller calls a generational shift from earlier YouTubers ‘inspired by film, television, and/or written essays’ to a younger cohort that ‘grew up alongside the video essay’ and now pushes its boundaries. Nonetheless, among the poll’s selections, this self-awareness clearly spans generations. A shared focus on the politics of visibility links works as varied as Lily Alexandre’s Trans Day of Vanishing (6 votes), josh (with parentheses)’s You are a better writer than AI. (Yes, you.) (6 votes), and Big Joel’s You Are into Mousetrap YouTube (4 votes). Josh’s piece in particular illustrates a wider YouTube trend of scrutinising AI models, especially ChatGPT, and their growing presence in daily life. Despite such weighty subjects, Denis Kefallinos notes a concurrent wave of ‘borderline comedy essays,’ which ‘mess with tone’ and toy with ‘absurd subject matter and harsh delivery’ – showing that this self-awareness trend takes many forms. Finally, some quick notes about the distribution of the voters themselves. Of the 72 contributors, 46 were male, 22 female, and 4 non-binary. This imbalance occurred despite our best intentions, yet it doesn’t deviate from the patterns of previous years. The results suggest that it didn’t carry over into any dramatic bias: among the nine most-voted video essays, six were created or co-created by women, many of which feature explicitly feminist, queer, or trans perspectives. As for demographics, the overwhelming majority of voters still come from the global centre, particularly the Anglo-American sphere (the United States leading with 24, followed by the UK with 13 and Canada with 5). Unfortunately, this reflects both the distribution of videographic practice across the world and its capacity to be disseminated in English and presented on prestigious platforms. The participation of experts from semi-peripheral regions (the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Romania) and countries outside the Euro-American sphere (Iran, Mexico) offers a glimmer of hope, as does the presence of numerous non-English video essays in the poll. Given the breadth of the poll, any selection is inevitably just a cross-section, and in this spirit we’ve selected some notable entries before granting readers the opportunity to dive into the full list and accompanying commentary from our voters. The final results are based on confidentially submitted ballots, all of which are available below. Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková, as a duo, are often mentioned in the poll and contribute greatly to the videographic community, both as creators and archaeologists of the practice. Once again, they seized a popular (and ephemeral) feature of our shared videographic histories to ask “What kind of artefact, if any, is the star wipe?” (Byron Davies), with the whimsical style and acute analysis that characterise their work. Co-winner of the 2025 Marienbad Film Festival’s Audiovisual Essay Competition, this video essay establishes “videographic form as a queer methodology” (Catherine Grant). Formally and discursively, this work succeeds in conveying a “disorienting sense of foreboding made eerie and uncanny through repetition of sound and image” (Dayna McLeod). “Films are carried by the hands of their lovers [through history]; by their shadows” (Amin Komijani and Kasra Karbasi). Awarded as one of the two winners at Marienbad this year, this video essay prolongs Varda’s gesture with finesse and an intimate understanding of the filmmaker’s work. This subtlety takes the form of a voice, that of the videast’s child, and their affectionate dialogue resonating from within the images, inside the images. The impressive Trans Day of Vanishing produces “a raw examination of visibility, vulnerability, and safety” (Denis Kefallinos) as a trans person in public space. Filming outdoors, dissecting surveillance apparatuses, vlogging in the dark, the videast subverts YouTube’s usual codes in favour of an uncanniness that turns our gaze back on us – and makes us anxiously look over our shoulder. Addressing a contemporary concern, this video proposes a way to move beyond moral, cognitive or even political positions criticising the use of LLMs. The argument is simple but deeply potent: “the purpose of writing is to meet with another person” (OutOfCharacters), to communicate. And the way of formulating it, using desktop narration, a format that YouTube’s algorithm doesn’t really like (Queline Meadows), is in line with the principle set out in the video: why not just give it a try, someone might be watching. In Tafakory’s new essay, “we are simultaneously seeing the prison bars and the freedom that the palimpsest points to” (Carlos Natálio). This videographic palimpsest superimposes flowers immortalised by cinema, collected in post-revolution Iranian films she features in all of her works, with ancient manuscripts and their flourishing illuminations. This desktop diary observes “the mediality of the Palestinian genocide, [and proposes] a meditation on what it truly means to witness a live-streamed genocide” (Flavia Dima), questioning the circulation of these images between networks, screens and bodies. How does one incorporate a constant flux of violence and impotence?

Petri Pillar of Garbage Julian Ross Jemma Saunders Dan Schindel Daniel Simpson (Eyebrow Cinema) Shannon Strucci Scout Tafoya Max Tohline César Ustarroz Ilinca Vanau Jiří Žák Barbara Zecchi Fiction writer, video essayist (as SolidArf) & English Professor at Quinnipiac University I revisit Ander Monson’s Essay as Hack often: “I fear for the essay, friends, and its bad reputation.” To me, video essays represent the best of what he considers ‘hacks’ – quirky, audiovisual experiments we keep Frankensteining together to revitalise a genre of writing that students have been taught to fear. What students forget is that essays aren’t just a genre of writing. They’re a genre of thought. The video essay is a flexible medium, one that grants a creator the chance to collage home video, guerrilla filmmaking, docupoetics, play, and personal narrative to land at a thesis that is both deeply specific and widely enlightening. What feels particularly urgent about the medium in 2025 is how it continues to put the human front-and-centre in the essay. My favourites of the year leaned into the idiosyncrasies of human thought. You are a better writer than AI. (Yes, you.) by josh (with parentheses) It is a truth universally acknowledged that every institution of higher ed in 2025 must be in want of an AI policy. Geist, an educator, has clearly been in dozens of mandatory meetings about this. But he’s interested in something beyond the policy level: Here, he talks to (and about) students in the language of students. The entire essay is a recording of a screen where new popups and windows push and overlap, talking to each other and singing over each other; harmonising into an impassioned defence of recombinant writing. But that remixing, he shows us, is most interesting when it’s deliberate and from the heart. Every meme, reference, and literary allusion he uses has a point. Throughout, he is also talking to ChatGPT. Can Gen-AI have a point? When? When not? Equal parts sincere, thoughtful, and inspiring, Geist’s video is a masterclass in play as pedagogy. The Unforgivable Sin of Ms Rachel by Lindsay Ellis Lindsay Ellis’s latest – which appropriately doubles as a fundraiser for the Palestinian Children’s Relief Fund – is the most cohesive multi-hour video essay epic I’ve seen. She uses the story of children’s YouTuber and educator Ms. Rachel as a starting point: to discuss history, religion, geopolitics, film and entertainment, language, and the current US administration’s ‘war on empathy’. What do we do in the face of all that? What do we do in the face of death tolls measured in almost-incomprehensible numbers? Ellis has always been a forerunner in the space, but what is so exceptional about the piece is that she never loses sight of what Ms. Rachel (and other prominent children’s entertainment pioneers throughout history) represent in this context. Social and emotional learning begins at home, after all. What lessons have we taken away? What do we impart to our kids? Fantasies of Nuremberg by Jacob Geller What happens when we reduce an entire history – conflicts, controversies, contradictions, context – into a singular historical ‘event?’ This is where Jacob Geller begins with his research on the Nuremberg trials. What follows is one of his most comprehensive, well-written, and well-researched essays to date. But hanging over that research, and over his litany of primary sources, is a deep vulnerability. Geller demonstrates – both through his writing and through some visceral editing choices – that it is tempting to fantasise about justice and consequence. He wrestles with that temptation as he speaks. He tempts us too. But in our present moment, do those fantasies mean anything? The answer he lands on is not surprising. But it is necessary, and framed with the gravitas and call to further introspection that Geller always inspires. Bluey Is Perfect, And That Terrifies Me by MML’s Commentaries Prior to watching this, I had a passing understanding of the cultural phenomenon that is Bluey. I knew some younger relatives who watched it, I knew I had friends in their 30s who were (for whatever reason) mesmerised by it, and I knew my spouse – a developmental psychologist – really appreciated what it was doing in the children’s entertainment space. I watched this over a long evening with her. MML’s Commentaries illuminated many of the ‘whys’ for me. But I didn’t just learn about the creative choices that make up Bluey or why it has such a refreshing level of trust in the kids who tune in. I saw, with fresh eyes, how kids’ media looks differently to us in our 30s and up. I saw the anxieties that can arise from that. I saw MML’s Commentaries put a refreshing level of trust into us, as viewers, too. Etched into this video is a family saga, a love story, and a heartfelt dialogue between the real and the imagined. Solarpunk: When Your Ideology Is Pictures by Sam Kern (Afterthoughts) I first encountered Sam Kern’s work through videos on gaming UX / UI. More recently, she’s been working on the Change-Makers series on activism and organising. All in all, there are few essayists better equipped to analyse the various rifts between aesthetics and practice. The solarpunk movement – or rather, aesthetic – seems ripe for exactly that analysis. Kern picks out and examines an astonishing repository of solarpunk illustrations, videos, and (arguably) photographs. These images look good; idyllic even. But do they sound good? Are they saying enough to ‘sound’ at all? It would be easy to critique the genre and land on a conclusion that gives way to doomerism, but that’s not what Kern does here. Her video is a new solarpunk: one that doesn’t just imagine a brighter future, but is honest about what it’ll take to get there. The Space Truck Sim Where You’re Doomed to Fail by LambHoot There is a moment in LambHoot’s video that made me feel physically ill – and it’s not just because the subject matter is Star Trucker, a truck simulator in space (a video game premise that sounds like my personal hell). It’s because LambHoot describes his gameplay experience in such sharp, vivid terms. The world of Star Trucker is a capitalist hell where every minute you do not spend working – even if it’s to take care of your own wellbeing – is a minute wasted. There is a price tag on everything. There is a price tag on air. As with any other LambHoot piece, this is of course not just about Star Trucker. It is about how we synonymise self-worth with work. It is about the anxiety of opportunity cost. It is about the economy of how we spend our free time – and who gets to enjoy free time with dignity. Professor of Film, Television & Digital Media and Design Media Arts at UCLA As a creator and scholar who has been teaching and advocating for evolved modes of scholarly expression for many years, I embrace a broader range of videographic and multimodal scholarship than is reflected in the nominations included here. However, each of the works I have selected shares a reflective relationship to its chosen medium, often including formal experimentation but always making explicit and distinctive use of affordances that are specific to the videographic medium. Animation in London/Matchmove in Bangalore: Territorial Profiles of Visual Effects (VFX) Workforces in the Global Media Industries by Suryansu Guha Richly illustrated and densely narrated, this video is based on deep, original field research that makes a convincing argument in opposition to conventional wisdom about the (lack of) ‘creativity’ associated with visual effects that are commonly outsourced to the Global South. Mapping Roma by Jessica Wax-Edwards A sometimes playful and often idiosyncratic exploration of space and memory using marketing materials from Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma (2018), overlaying footage from the film with vernacular video captured by the creator, revisiting and reflecting on the construction of memory spaces both within and outside the diegesis of Cuarón’s film. (dis)Orientating Horror: Feeling Queerly by Lucy Fife Donaldson Experimental use of videographic effects interwoven with text-based analysis that re-envisions cinematic landscapes and aerial scenery; a highly effective use of videographic affordances for engaging the concept of queering cinematic form. The Chemistry of Character in Breaking Bad by Jason Mittell A first-of-its-kind videographic book that offers a groundbreaking intervention in the field of videographic criticism, demonstrating the author’s virtuosic range of critical styles, modes and voices in conjunction with incisive commentary analysing the complexity of long-form, serial character development on an iconic TV series. Media scholar, video essayist, and archivist (Queen Mary University of London & Národní filmový archiv) The Holes We Left Behind by Jacob Smith This video essay, published in the archive-oriented dossier of Movie (edited by John Gibbs), is exemplary in its revelation of intricate economic and environmental issues within a single film. Its focal point is Breaking Away (1979), a coming-of-age movie set in Indianapolis that, in the part where I come from, is almost unknown. Combining scenes from the film with archival footage and a skillful argumentative voice-over, Smith reframes the movie through the lens of real-life workers in the limestone industry. The film’s rumination on generational conflict and shifting economic realities is minimalistically yet powerfully confronted with the archive effect of slowly disappearing historical images and the deep time of geology. Bomba Bernal by Khavn de la Cruz Thanks to César Ustarroz from Found Footage Magazine, I finally saw a film by this extravagant genius of Filipino avant-garde cinema. Bomba Bernal is a sarcastic, often uncompromising look at the bomba genre – a wave of lowbrow Filipino erotic films that experienced its heyday from the late 1960s to the 1980s – yet at the same time it summons its ghosts to reveal, in its deteriorating hints of a potential social liberation, a distinctive charm. Rarely is this ambivalence expressed so cleverly and amusingly, owing to inspiration from Filipino film critic Ishmael Bernal as well as collage-like editing and sound design based on cheap-sounding local appropriations of popular music mainstays. Move on Down: Precarity in Contemporary Hungarian Cinema by László Strausz It is a real shame that there are still so few video essays about East-Central European cinema, especially about contemporary work. That is why I was so pleased that this remarkably detailed and well-researched 20-minute piece was published in Iluminace. Strausz’s work foregrounds the depiction of precarity in Hungarian cinema after the fall of the Communist regime, which triggered tectonic social transformations and widespread instability. Narrated and formally structured in a deliberately non-flamboyant manner, it very effectively argues for the role of class in shaping patterns of representation. It also offers thought-provoking reflections on embodied and accented modes of scholarship. Crochet is Sick! by Alison Peirse Even though I have recently preferred ambitious, sprawling video essays, that doesn’t mean I underestimate the value of simplicity done right. Peirse’s rhythmic, briskly cut video on the ambiguous function of crochets in horror movies neatly wraps up everything it wants to say in under four minutes, testifying to the ability to express central genre tensions through such a simple, workaday object: a source of comfort becoming a source of dread. For what is essentially a supercut, the essay includes self-reflexive moments that not only situate Peirse’s fascination but also, in a particularly infectious way, invite us to share the world of horror crochets with her. Baby It’s You (Lucy Dacus Edit) by Ian Garwood Much like Jacob Smith’s video essay mentioned earlier, Garwood’s work was an invitation for me to watch a forgotten film I hadn’t known – and again it was a coming-of-age story. Baby It’s You (1983) may resemble the 1950s-nostalgia films typical of its era, yet it is also suffused with sadness and unresolved class conflict. Garwood explores this mixture paradoxically by retelling the film – especially the arc of its lead female character – through the sensibility of vidding and fan-made music videos. Although I have never been drawn to Lucy Dacus’s music, within this jukebox-like collage everything suddenly made sense. Afterlives by Kevin B. Lee Despite finding myself in the position of co-coordinating this poll with the essay’s author, I didn’t want to lose the opportunity to mention Lee’s long-awaited feature-length desktop documentary. Having engaged with this mode of video essay–making both theoretically and practically for quite a few years, I was still struck by how meticulously Lee weaves together the multifarious images of unspeakable violence we encounter in the online world and beyond. The documentary reminds us that the desktop experience isn’t just about wonder and gratification but, nowadays perhaps more often, about fatigue, numbness, even horror. Best viewed in tandem with Neta Alexander’s newest book Interface Frictions. Making Fiction Flow by Melanie Bell & Catherine Grant Also published in the archival dossier of Movie, Bell and Grant’s work on the not-always-visible art of script supervising reminded me of the value of rewatching video essays in different contexts. Clocking in at almost 33 minutes, I initially found it difficult to watch because of its repetitive style. Yet after seeing it on a big screen (twice!), I got it. It takes a deliberate mode of attention to let the almost parametric multi-screen structure sink in and to appreciate the storytelling of script supervisor Penny Eyles. The video is highly recommended for anyone interested in how oral history can be translated into a videographic form. Video maker and media scholar at Tel Aviv University In alphabetical order: 100 Years of History in 100 Films by kaptainkristian A skillfully-edited journey across a hundred years of history – both real and fictional – through the eyes of cinema. Images of the past, depicted mostly by later films, eventually give way to futuristic visions of the present as imagined by the cinema of the past. It does not end well. F. W. Murnau’s ‘Sunrise’: A Mystic Writing Pad by Cristina Álvarez López Incredible. Insightful. Inspired. I couldn’t do it justice by describing what it does in words. Just watch it. And read Cristina’s own words. I Can Hear Someone Coming by Alison Peirse Published as part of Queer/ing Horror: Video Essays at the Intersection of Horror and Queerness, edited by Dayna McLeod for Monstrum, this video offers a hilariously subversive take on the queer potentialities of 1930s horror. Fabulous. Miradas by Pablo Serrano Torres Produced for the 2023 Embodying the Video Essay workshop at Bowdoin College and later published at [in]Transition, this is a playful, touching, and beautifully vulnerable reflection on queerness, identity, embodiment, and collaboration. Call me a sucker for any video essay that features footage of video essayists doing karaoke. Panorama of Western State Penitentiary by Eli Boonin-Vail And I’m equally a sucker for any video essay that opens with dictionary definitions. Drawing on footage from a diverse range of sources – archival and contemporary, documentary and fiction, found and original – this video reflects on and problematises our voyeuristic fascination with prisons as sites of surveillance, spectacle, and tourism. Sebastián Leilo’s Two Glorias – Aging in Translation by Barbara Zecchi A comparative analysis of a Chilean film and its English-language remake, this highly affective piece makes brilliant use of the multiscreen format to explore issues of age, gender, and transcultural adaptation. Terrific. The Disturbing Current: Three-Shots in The Awful Truth by Joel Blackledge A wonderful examination of how staging, blocking, and framing are used to great dramatic and comedic effect in Leo McCarey’s The Awful Truth. The video employs an ideally suited, frustratingly simple formal device of the ‘I wish I’d thought of that!’ variety. Spot on. Video essayist, editor, and semiotician; Intermediality MSc student at the University of Edinburgh Grand Theft Auto Is Killing Everything by chriswaves A meta take on the talking-head style of video essays and commentary videos, chriswaves applies a frenetic analysis with hyper-intentional editing. Clips are sequenced and overlayed in a way that supplement and supersede the spoken points he makes about the meaning of mediums and the state of the creator economy in the middle of this decade. HOT TO GO! by Cǎlin Husar There is no shortage of studies queering David Lynch’s body of work, and Cǎlin Husar’s analysis of Eraserhead is solid. Husar contrasts Lynch’s debut with one of the most iconic, joyous queer anthems of recent memory to elucidate Eraserhead’s themes of heteronormative pressures to perform, parent, plus resultant anxiety. “Interpretation” (or “Me (or, “Me (or, Me”)”)”) by JerryTerry The final boss of meta-interpretation, this video is a rat king of essays in 2025. It starts out (as an introspection of) analysing video game Signalis and its fan discourse, exploring the notion of generative interpretation as its own artistic expression. Kaleidoscopically tumbling outward into meta-layers of meta-layers, it can get a bit hard to parse, but is ultimately a meditation on creating online, interpreting online, the self-observation that comes in both activities, and their interweaving. red dead redemption 2 is still a vibe by orangewall An anthology of three mini-essays about videogame aesthetics and the sequel to rockstar’s epic western. orangewall’s own visual style is striking, directly filming old monitors displaying relevant gameplay and video sources to create comforting, retro feel. It continues into the writing, too, with a general similarity to mainstream video essays of the late 2010s, just sharper. There Are No More Normal Guys by Jack Saint Ah, the infamous t-word. or x-word. That site everyone used to use. Jack Saint observes, from afar, a viral spat over misunderstandings of masculine norms, before an extrapolation. Normal guys no longer become normal online: if they aren’t subject to outrage, they’re deified. Jack overlays news coverage in audio and video forms deftly, in between spoken commentary. His synthesis of modes examine these two extremes with case studies in respect to minor online spectacles and major news events. You are a better writer than AI. (Yes, you.) by josh (with parentheses) A fantastic screen-trawling odyssey across the perforations of AI across contemporary culture. josh (with parentheses) uniquely compares and contrasts video and audio sources within the diegetic space of a mac desktop. It’s reminiscent of Occitane Lacurie’s doc from last year’s poll, xena’s body (a menstrual auto-investigation using an iPhone). What is the state of writing, and writing online, now? Especially in a time of post-plagiarism super-awareness, of large-language model dupes, and dupes of dupes, of concern, of hyperreality. Josh answers the call. Media scholar, bricoleur It was a very difficult year and it seems that my picks seem to reflect some of the pain and loss it held. Once again, I become aware of how video essays for me are not just a way to think, but a way to exist. These video essays and the people who made them (and so many more I couldn’t mention here) make me want to go on. Sticky by Maria Hofmann What does it mean to witness? How do we watch the unwatchable? The Anthropocene Will Eat Itself by Cormac Donnelly The apocalypse is coming to a screen near you. The Video Essay About The Show by Jason Mittell A scholar is analysing a series by playing a scholar who analyses a series and makes a video essay series about it. Mise-en-abyme is Jason Mittell’s middle name. Age Perfect by Dayna McLeod Once again, Dayna is hitting you like a splash of cold water. Right in the face of a consumer society so obsessed with policing the aging female body. I am wide awake again. Look at Me by Alison Peirse These piercing gazes. They hit me in the blink of an eye. Caught in the Dream of the Other by Cristina Álvarez López & Adrian Martin The mirror is a trap. And a portal. You won’t come out of it unchanged. Line Drawings by Joseph Popper The dotted line – a fragile, fractured umbilical cord connecting us to the outer space. There is something strangely relieving in knowing how easily we can become untethered. Curator of Film and Video for e-flux Narrative by Anocha Suwichakornpong The self-reflective work reveals how political trauma moves like a spirit through people’s lives, unsettling what one sees, hears, and remembers, and how film can become a tool for seeking justice and healing. You Won’t Feel a Thing by Hiwa K. Emotionally impactful film calls into question the marginalization of Indigenous forms of knowledge and healthcare by the corporate interests of Western medicine through the masterful use of film essay style. Slet 1988 by Marta Popivoda A masterful combination of the archival footage and documentary to reflect on the specters of history. Experimental / Essay Filmmaker, Poet, Exceptional Man / Average Pisces I am attracted to poetic video essays; non-traditional, humorous, experimental videographic works. My choices tend to bend the definition of what a video essay is… but I believe in the inclusive nature of the form. So, here goes: Frontier by Brunella Tedesco-Barlocco An elegant meditation on the culture of cowboys and cinema, with a hand-lettered feel. Transformed clips of relevant movies enrich the understanding of the author’s thesis. The whole video has a slowness about it and a lulling sound design that I found refreshing. Paul Schrader on The Florida Project by James Whale Bake Sale Wise old sage Paul Schrader appraises the anecdotal nature of Sean Baker’s film in a nicely cut together videographic piece by stalwart YouTuber James Whale Bake Sale. As a Floridian myself, I appreciated the embodied representation of colours that define my state and a revisit to a film I saw before I ever found myself living there. The Thinking Machine #94: Shot Missing by Cristina Álvarez López and Adrian Martin This is the most ‘Los Angeles’ video essay this side of Thom Andersen. I have been an admirer of the trope where you juxtapose two similar films in one videographic work. I’ve done it in my own art practice and I admire how it was done here. I had never heard of the film by Abel Ferrara, but sure enough it deserves a comparison to Lynch’s Lost Highway. Clever associations abound, but there is also a sustained and unified mood that makes the two films seem as one; surely the ultimate purpose behind such an exploration. Writer; overseeing the research and documentation at the Centre Pompidou film collection Three encounters in three different contexts: a cinema; an exhibition; my phone. Soundtrack to a Coup d’Etat by Johan Grimonprez A reused footage fresco on the geopolitical (and musical) context that led to the assassination of Patrice Lumumba in 1961. This montage of archival material is devoid of accompanying voiceover, instead its textual elements are either to be read on screen (provided with bibliographical footnotes) or heard as direct quotations read aloud on the soundtrack. Distributed theatrically in France in the fall of 2025, I was able to watch it on a monumental-sized screen. The magnifying effect on many of the low-resolution transfers is one of the work’s compelling aspects. Mais perto de você [Closer to You] by Isadora Soares Belletti Saw it as an installation in the collective exhibition L’art et la vie et inversement at Beaux-Arts de Paris in March 2025. The young Brazilian artist, based in France, made this video portrait of her watching the sunset in Belo Horizonte, her hometown in Brasil, next to her grandmother, Teresinha Soares. Journal or essay? It is an attempt to record a casual moment – a fleeting conversation, ordering take-out food – with a studied insistence on the first-person account (via the hand-held camera capturing the sun from the balcony). Secret des stars: Bella Hadid by Dr Chloé Mathez-Loïc Chloé Mathez-Loïc appeared in my Instagram feed with one reel about the surgical secrets behind Bella Hadid’s face. This one video was posted on her account, in collaboration with Forever Institut (apparently the first centre of cosmetic medicine in Switzerland), and openly inscribed itself in the vein of the ‘Secret de stars’ content, popular on TikTok. It appears she published only three reels so far: a similar one on Kylie Jenner, and an interview in which she answers some questions about her work and personal hobbies. The format is canonical in its kind: Dr Mathez-Loïc looks at a photo on her phone and comments on surgical techniques used to achieve certain effects on the given public persona, while the viewer sees a picture in the foreground. The content is informative, but it is her calmness, off-pace in the realm of reels, as if oblivious of its destination, and a bordering-humour detachment, that makes her reel more intriguing than the ones by her online peers. Webby Award-winning video essayist, writer, and producer I’ve been making video essays for over 14 years. Work-Life Balance • A Podcastèsque Video Essay by Melis Altınso and Ceyda Ece Akköse This is what the sociology of cinema should aim at; challenging the everyday norms with curiosity and acidic wit. Nebulous Encounters by Catherine Grant Anytime a creator can effectively juxtapose two moving images to the point where it captivates me, it is a success. Grant understands how our eyes and hearts talk to the screen. The Pulse by Catherine Salnikova If These Walls Could Talk: The Shining Video Essay Clipse — Let God Sort Em Out (Official Album Trailer) by Clipse Clipse have possibly made the best music album of 2025, and in their promotion leading up to its release, have given the world the year’s best video mashup. Professor of Cinema Studies, Savannah College of Art and Design My video essay viewing this year has been shaped by my preparation for teaching a course on the subject. I’ve been drawn to videos that exemplify successful audiovisual applications of cinema studies methods and arguments, and I think these three will provide great examples and fodder for discussion. The Hand That Touches the Arm by Calac Nogueira This video assembles an impressive number and variety of film clips that convey a very specific gesture – the assistive touch (usually by a man) of another person (usually a woman) on the arm or elbow. This common action is wonderfully defamiliarised via the supercut, revealing a hidden lexicon that is open to interpretation. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková This video essay is both delightful and substantive. It manages to offer a history and theory of the star wipe as a cultural artefact (you never knew you needed this, but you do!), exploring and embodying the star wipe’s playful impudence that resonates well beyond nostalgia. This video essay beautifully exemplifies the audiovisual and essayistic potentials of a media archaeology methodology. The Water Diaries, or My Letter to Jane by Chiara Grizzaffi Chiara Grizzaffi’s decision to frame this video as a letter to Jane [Campion] is an inspired appropriation, resulting in a work that is both playful and sincere. Her voice-over is so engaging – rich in essayistic potential as it weaves together personal narrative with pressing questions about the larger world, anchored in the possibilities of feminist theory. I would love to see a version of this video that actually uses footage from Campion’s films, but I realise that wasn’t within the constraints of the assignment. Curator, writer Zifzafa by Lawrence Abu Hamdan At once imaginative, beautiful, and incensed. Daria’s Night Flowers by Maryam Tafakory The essay form as dissolved into narrative. Partition by Diana Allan Smart, righteous, and lucid work. Creator of Be Kind Rewind, a YouTube channel that explores film history. A Man Like My Aunt: Community and Desire in Working Girls by Kallan Benjamin Benjamin thoroughly analyses the opening sequences of Dorothy Arzner’s Working Girls to explore how a working class women’s boarding house functions as a communal space that exists outside of patriarchy, heterosexuality, and the workplace. It’s a true pleasure to see Arzner’s work receive such detailed attention. Technology Isn’t Fun Anymore by Drew Gooden In this video, Drew Gooden articulates the casual frustrations foisted upon consumers by endless mergers, acquisitions, and content wars waged by major corporations. Seemingly no one, he points out, seeks to materially improve the collective user experience. Why can’t you watch your local basketball team on television? Why does an app that turns lights on and off have a social media component? Everything is a nightmare; at least Gooden can help us laugh about it. HELLO? by Alison Peirse Landline phones play a significant role in slasher films. Women answer in fear, hang up in haste, and shudder in anticipation of violence. Peirse imagines alternative (better) futures for these characters. Solidarity finds the final girls. Researcher in film and philosophy. Member of the film exhibition and programming collective Salón de Cines Múltiples (SACIMU) in Oaxaca, Mexico Piel de toro muerto by Aroldo Murguia It’s fitting to begin with a bold statement about the origin and nature of cinema, emerging from the South. In an overpowering mixture of Super 8 footage and digital photogrammetry, flickers and rotations, as well as cyanotypes, rotoscoping, and frottage, Peruvian filmmaker and programmer Aroldo Murguia declares the ancient Toro Muerto petroglyphs in the Arequipa region of Peru, marked by continuous sequences of animals in movement, to be the site where cinema was invented thousands of years ago. The claim rests somewhat less on the petroglyphs’ age in comparison with European sites that have invited similar speculations (such as the Copper Age rock carvings at Valcamonica with which Jonathan Walley begins his book Cinema Expanded) than on the tangible passage of time constituting Murguia’s audiovisual argument: incarnating, rather than simply hypothesising, the place of cinema’s invention. This is an argument backed by a firm command of metaphors – “El cine es una serpiente que constantemente cambia de piel” (“Cinema is a snake that constantly sheds its skin”), he says in an opening title – and Murguia is indeed demonstrating a protocinema (an ‘ancestor’ of cinema, in Juan Camilo Martínez’s description) apt to be recognised as such under present mutations in the digital age. Accompanying the film’s premiere this year in the ‘Umbrales’ experimental section of the FICUNAM festival in Mexico City was a brilliant catalogue statement by Murguia locating the matter of cinema, and not just its idea, in early 20th-century ‘sololoy’ (celluloid) dolls in Mexico, thus placing Piel de toro muerto, for all that it sensorily inherits from the wider cosmos, at the level of fragile toys – as he says, in a cinema of “sololoy”. Mahmoud Darwish: In the Presence of Absence by Maryam Tafakory “Time was less defiant than now”, reads Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish in his 2005 poem ‘Tabāq’ (‘Antithesis’), memorialising Edward Said and recalling their first meeting in New York 30 years earlier. Tafakory’s uncanny work conjoins a video from that same year of Darwish reading ‘Antithesis’ in Ramallah – a recording that continues its errant passage around the internet (as of this writing it appears to have been removed from YouTube) – with a letter from Mohamad Golabi explaining the unguent that the same poem provided him while recovering in a hospital in New York. I saw this work in another Western capital, Lisbon, in the excellent two-part film programme curated by Cristina Hadwa and Raquel Schefer, Trojan Cinema: Spectral Archives of Palestine, which foregrounded Darwish’s self-definition as a ‘Trojan poet’, in search of the voices of the defeated (in ‘Antithesis’ identified with Said: “the last epic hero / defending the right of Troy / to share the narrative”). Video essay conventions of blackness surrounding a split screen offer something like the enveloping comfort that Golabi ascribes to Darwish’s words, which for him helped to render the impossible less ‘distant’. The poem’s title of ‘Antithesis’ then covers not only the split screen, or the epistolary connection between Golabi and Tafakory, or the friendship between Darwish and Said, but also Darwish’s expression of the vanities of pleading for an oppressor’s understanding, even under fantasies of parity: “Had my sword / been larger than my rose, would you / have asked if I would have acted like you?” The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková The gentle, welcoming touches of this sparkling, deeply researched video only serve to accentuate its central philosophical question, one few would have thought to ask: What kind of artefact, if any, is the star wipe? Indeed, what kinds of objects are editing transitions, and how do they feature in our memory? These questions turn out to depend on classical aesthetic debates about theatricality, ostentation, and taste – permeating the video’s unironic embrace of corn and personal address – as well as the commodity status of the gimmick (as formulated by Sianne Ngai). But then, what does it mean for an editing device to symbolise doing too little (and thus ostentatiously revealing a readiness to do anything at all) to please another? Did we always know that there was such pathos in the star wipe? The question more directly addressed in this video is what would it be to touch the star wipe, something that Anger and Hanáková undertake in a didactic method of printing, cutting, and touching also used in another important video from this year, A Tale of Two Desktops: The First Czech Films in Parallel Worlds. They thus in effect raise the question of how to locate the star wipe’s seemingly perfect geometry among the ‘weird shapes’ in early Czech archival footage analysed in the latter and in Anger’s book Towards a Film Theory from Below. Anger and Hanáková say that the star wipe points to paradoxes of simultaneous bewitchment and disenchantment, though in taking another look at one of their examples – George Kuchar’s Secrets of the Shadow World (1999) – and hearing Kuchar’s friend Andy Martinez sincerely describe his encounters with fairies in the mountains of Taos, New Mexico, I find myself inspired by the video to prefer to think that a world, whether diegetic or extra-diegetic, that makes space for star wipes is a significantly re-enchanted one. The Holes We Left Behind by Jacob Smith While The Return of the Star Wipe is an archaeology of media ephemerality, The Holes We Left Behind is an assertion of permanence. Together with Piel de Toro Muerto, this video is a landmark of petrocinematic criticism. Making a beautiful case for how the Hollywood coming-of-age film Breaking Away (Peter Yates, 1979) is an archive of Indiana limestone, Smith draws on eye-opening material from Bloomington Community Access Television (BCAT) and the Indiana Limestone Company. This most importantly features an interview with Harold Dugan Elgar, the real-life master stone carver who briefly appears in the original film as a former colleague of the protagonist’s father, played by Paul Dooley, who has gone from cutting stone to selling used cars (from one petro-economy to another, as Smith says). In an especially affecting moment, a cropped shot from the film of Dooley’s hand touching limestone on the Indiana University campus gives way to archival audio from BCAT narrating the formation of Indiana Limestone in the Mississippian period. Without Smith making this explicit, there is something familiar here: it might be the petro equivalent of the ‘man existing alone’ observatory speech in that other coming-of-age film invoking a planetary timescale, Rebel Without a Cause. This is an essay that – including in its use of, in its author’s words, ‘fragile’ archival video from community access TV – absolutely transmits weight. Animation in London/Matchmove in Bangalore: Territorial Profiles of Visual Effects (VFX) Workforces in the Global Media Industries by Suryansu Guha This vital and richly documented essay busts persistent myths about the geopolitics of labor in the visual effects (VFX) industry, drawing on interviews with workers in studios in India. Guha demonstrates that the proliferation of VFX in Hollywood blockbusters in the last two decades is not just the result of technology, but also of the emergence of a racialised global infrastructure, where offshore VFX studios supply a ‘standing reserve’ of labour to the Global North. But while the division of labor captured in the video’s title (Animation in London/Matchmove in Bangalore) is real, Guha argues that the myth underlying it, of matchmove and other outsourced VFX work as uncreative ‘lower-level’, ‘grunt work’ is manifestly not: precarity and racialization also mask where and among whom a great deal of the creative VFX work in fact takes place. A remarkable example of obfuscation of labor elaborated on by Guha is how the false marketing of Oppenheimer (2023) as free of CGI necessitated a sparse – and, in the end, racialised – list of end credits of only 77 VFX workers. We learn that when the British-Indian VFX studio released its own, much longer, supplementary credits for Oppenheimer, 90% named were Indian. I would like to see this research widened in order to account for the longer history of outsourcing in Hollywood, including ‘runaway’ animation and maquila animation practices in Latin America, beginning in the late 1950s. As Juan Manuel Aurrecoechea explains in his history of Mexican animation, El episodio perdido, when Rocky and Bullwinkle first aired, its principal animators in Mexico City were appalled to see their names absent from the credits, taken up only by Anglo ones. Prophets and Propaganda, or, If Faces Tire You, What Will Movies Do? by Stephen Broomer This intriguingly measured study of Ron Ormond’s 1970s Evangelical sermon films featuring Baptist preacher Estus Pirkle goes far beyond indulging in the films’ camp and anti-communist hysterics, and instead focuses on the functioning of Ormond’s closeups on Pirkle’s face. Drawing on Slavko Vorkapich’s poetics and the idea that the closeup “could disrupt the uncanny of the photoplay to serve a greater truth”, Broomer argues that Ormond uses these closeups on the preacher to “much the same end” as Vorkapich: distancing cinema from theatre. Ormond thus renders film and sermon as one, to amplifying effect: according to Broomer, repetition of the patriarch’s face becomes an effective (not just camp) vehicle of brainwashing. Viewing Prophets and Propaganda in light of The Return of the Star Wipe, I am led to ask: Is there something gimmicky about the closeup of the face that august theorising about it since the early 20th century has obscured – or perhaps sublimated? Have we learned to ignore the gimmickry of the closeup? The present-day heirs of Ormond and Pirkle in the US teach us that gimmickry and brainwashing are hardly antithetical. Digital curator, Fotomuseum Winterthur I have selected works from the field of media arts and digital cultures that connect with the genre of video essay yet experiment with its form through networked and digital properties, or where the video essay is part of a larger project – extending installations and performances usually hosted in art galleries and museums. I am interested in how the format of the video essay can extend its technical definitions and extend to a larger way of thinking, embedded in artistic projects which would not normally enter the circulation networks of video essays. A Life of Its Own: American Psycho by Sara Bezovšek A Life of Its Own is a series of experimental web-based works, large-scale wallpapers and installations by Sara Bezovšek, exploring how popular movies transform online into memes, GIFs and remixes. Focusing on culturally significant films like The Matrix, American Psycho and The Lord of the Rings, Bezovšek tracks how scenes are transformed into memetic fragments that gain a life of their own as they leave their source context and circulate online. Driven by free creative labour and network dynamics, images not only take on new meanings, but are easily repurposed for various social and political agendas. While memes from American Psycho equally critique and celebrate toxic masculinity, The Lord of the Rings is appropriated to support both right-wing and left-wing ideologies, for example. By organising the material collected from social media platforms and obscure online forums according to the films’ original plot, Bezovšek accentuates the spread of memetic content and its ability to seamlessly blend entertainment, ideologies and politics. Image Syncers by Nina Davies Nina Davies uses speculative fiction to examine the consequences of today’s ‘perception collapse’, taking as a starting point TikTok trends in which people mimic AI-generated videos. Her project Image Syncers imagines futures where AI-driven choreographies disrupt visual economies, generate alternative modes of meaning, and gesture toward communication with emerging algorithmic dimensions. The central video blends the narrative strategies of podcasts and video essays with imagery that merges AI-generated footage and performances choreographed by the artist. The world of Image Syncers extends across installations, photographic works, and live performances, forming a coherent universe in which language, images, and bodies evolve under the pervasive influence of synthetic media. Anatomy of a Non-Fact, Chapter 2: Tick Tick Tick… Boom by Martyna Marciniak Anatomy of Non-Fact is an artistic research project investigating how misinformation and information overload take shape in an era increasingly defined by post-optical imagery. The project spans different chapters and media, including a full recreation of the puffy coat generated in the now iconic AI image of the so-called ‘Balenciaga Pope’. In 2025, the second chapter of Anatomy of a Non-Fact continues the investigation started the year before, extending the study of the image of the pope to other symbols of broader visual cultures and economies. Anatomy of Non-Fact, Chapter 2: Tick Tick Tick… Boom sketches out possible futures for how visual truth might be constructed, and the effects of virality on political violence, and market instability. The video moves from a traditional essayistic form to a promotional narrative, introducing a system to generate effective ‘panic images’ to conveniently manipulate the market. Combining a critical reflection with a parodic advertisement, the project builds another layer on top of the world of manipulated images that the artist simultaneously constructs and critiques. Critic & researcher Agencia by May Santiago A deeply personal essay film that charts a new way forward for videographic criticism as it relates to not only activating the archive but working towards building new ones. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková A ground-breaking work that showcases the video essay’s potential for media archaeology, and one that charts a path forward for rediscovering and celebrating ephemera of the moving image. Air Bud Pt. II: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (Web Exclusive) by Last Week Tonight A bit of media analysis from a man and team who understand our time like no other. The World Doesn’t End When You Do by marlow magdalene A remarkable, personal work that expands our sense of what is possible with the archive. Mutineer by Scout Tafoya “By then, I’d seen a lot on TV…” Another astonishing work from a master. Cinephilia and History, or The Mystery of William Keighley by Christian Keathley An epic project, beautifully realised over many years by a scholar without whom much videographic criticism would not be made. Film critic, programmer, researcher, and translator I must confess that I’ve lagged behind a bit, this year, in terms of video essays, so this list is quite clearly open-ended (and should be taken as such). Even so – there are some gems that’ve caught my eye. Here they are: Debut, or, Objects of the Field of Debris as Currently Catalogued by Julian Castronovo Equal parts essay-film and (faux?) video essay, Castronovo’s polemic approach to the form and ingeniousness simply left me in awe upon my first viewing of it. A deeply rich text. happiness by Fırat Yücel What an effective, amazing work about the mediality of the Palestinian genocide, a meditation on what it truly means to witness a live-streamed genocide, amongst other apps and enormous quantities of digital debris – both grave and, at times, incredibly funny in its use of (self-effacing) dark humour. Being John Smith by John Smith Finally caught up with it this year. John Smith is like none other (pun intended?). Slet 1988 by Marta Popivoda Expanding upon her previous work, Popivoda does something quite incredible with the format here: she frames a video essay with auto-fictional insertions that emulate the perspective of a teenaged self. What a beautiful, playful innovation. Their Eyes by Nicolas Gourault The perspective of tech-colonialism – of outsourced labor, its gaze/regard, of the human cost that AI is constructed upon, of the new nightmarish ways that the contemporary panopticon keeps on finding to transform moving images into surveillance. Lloyd Wong, unfinished by Lesley Loksi Chan Video creator and visual content designer for YouTube How We’re Redesigning Audacity for the Future by Tantacrul Bit of a controversial choice, as this video is more of an advertisement for software the creator is promoting than a traditional video essay. Still, Tantacrul’s rhythm in editing and storytelling is something other creators can and should learn from. Controversial opinion: Norman Rockwell’s art was more than kitsch. Your thoughts?⁠⁠ by Josie Lewis One of my favourite recent short-form essays. Josie is well-versed in tackling a timely topic; challenging the kitsch nostalgia for a bygone era by revealing Norman Rockwell’s more progressive side. I Played Boku no Natsuyasumi 2 Every Day for a Month. Here’s What Happened by Static Canvas Another experimental video essay, from a creator whose work I’ve grown really fond of the past year. Tom from Static Canvas explores the summertime adventures of Boku no Natsuyasumi by writing diary entries after each play session. I love its approach to roleplaying as a form of analysis. Making Sense of ‘Dad Movies’ by In/Frame/Out I’ve been a fan of In/Frame/Out’s accessible approach to film analysis for years, and this topic is a great entry point for newcomers. It explores ‘Dadcore’ movies; what defines them and what they reveal about the audiences who love them. Delivered, as usual, in IFO’s smart writing and stylish editing. Mario Kart World’s real winner… is graphic design by elliotisacoolguy Elliot’s videos showcase many aspects of his graphic design expertise; how to create visuals across a range of unusual programs, viral design challenges, and, more importantly for this list, essays on what design communicates. In this case, he focuses on this year’s Mario Kart World and its overlooked fictional brands. blue prince is at odds with itself by Video Games Are Bad Don’t let the channel’s branding fool you; Harry’s writing cuts to the heart of what makes games great, blending genuine enthusiasm with a deep knowledge for the medium, while keeping things concise and approachable. His look at this year’s indie cult hit Blue Prince captures what his channel does best: making thoughtful arguments and exploring every interesting thread, all presented with the tone of a friendly chit-chat. How Many Times Can You Pee in Heavy Rain? by Allie Meowy My video essay of the year. Allie Meowy deserves credit for asking the question no one else would – and uncovering some fascinating insights along the way. Audiovisual essayist and Professor of Film Studies at the University of St Andrews Looking at my choices, I see that I have particularly valued work thinking through and about history, whether that is presenting marginalised histories through stories of digitisation or labour, or re-imagining personal histories and relationships to media, or speculative/revisionist approaches. Many of these pieces have made me consider the project of historical work in different ways, offering inspiration for how we might approach an archive, an institution, a role, a genre. On the formal side, I’ve chosen work that has impressed me in its audiovisual choices, and in particular, videos that have demonstrated how affective videographic form can be. All of these pieces have moved or entranced me, some have blown my mind with their skill, elegance and distinctiveness. (It turns out, multiscreens really speak to me!) As always there are simply too many pieces to choose from, so I’ve given some further recommendations in my comments. A Tale of Two Desktops: The First Czech Films in Parallel Worlds by Jiří Anger, Veronika Hanáková and Jiří Žák Compositionally and analytically rich, A Tale of Two Desktops offers an insight into early cinema which brings novel ways of thinking about how to address aesthetic specificity, especially aesthetic qualities that might be overlooked as mistakes or limitations of technology. This work does a great deal to expand and spatialise videographic approaches to the archive, as does John Gibbs’ highly enjoyable Backlot Connections. Post-Cinema: The Hall of Mirrors by Joel Blackledge I saw Post-Cinema: The Hall of Mirrors at the Marienbad Film Festival in June, and was really swept away by the power of its central formal conceit – a moving reel of images – which delivers and builds on engagement with theory. Though very different in pace and tone, the powerful force of the compositional choice reminded me of Catherine Grant’s use of a reel of images in Making Fiction Flow (in collaboration with Melanie Bell), which presents a masterful form for engaging with archival materials (in this case oral histories). See Under: Orient by Colleen Laird Striking, insightful, playful and incisive. This is at once dazzling and sharp, combining the intense sensory pleasures of the audiovisual essay with its capacity for critical insight. As with work I most admire, it makes me see, think and feel new things every time I watch. The Hand That Touches the Arm by Calac Nogueira Palpably demonstrating the power of accumulation, this piece illuminates the critical force of selection and editing. Quietly troubling, the audience’s attention is demanded. While Nogueira gradually calls our attention to look and feel for small gestures, Barbara Zecchi commands our attention to violence against women, making her own declarative and interventionist gestures in Overturning Carmen’s feminicide: Materialising women’s agency through the musical. Meet Part | Mothers Daughters by Viktoria Paranyuk Illusive and suggestive, while being somehow dense and stark simultaneously, Paranyuk’s compositional approach repays multiple viewings. Although the piece as a whole is formally very different, the tactility and care of the editing reminds me of Johannes Binotto’s work, especially his gestures of thought – inscription, which was my favourite this year. Shadow Self: On Agnès Varda’s Documenteur by Sadia Quraeshi Shepard Shepard’s work is beautifully poised; compelling formal decisions are married with stirring personal reflection. The quality of the personal with such arresting image-making connects to Dayna McLeod’s Pot Belly, a much cheekier work, which brings with it no less force for thinking through the specificity of the maker’s relationship to a particular film. On Listening by Pavitra Sundar Sundar’s audiovisual essay stages an encounter between a scene and film history, carried through sound but masterfully conceptualised through layering and text. The power of sound, and capacity to communicate narrative and affective experience through remixing of images achieved so brilliantly here is carried further by Alison Peirse’s HELLO?, in which new generic possibilities are built. Film lecturer and researcher at Liverpool John Moores University These video essays all lingered well beyond the brief period I spent watching them. Epitaph for Sonja 1: Body/Archive/Movement by Amanda Doxtater “It was devastating and beautiful at once” which appears in this video essay and eloquently sums up how I feel about it. Age Perfect by Dayna McLeod The unlikely yet pitch perfect meeting of video essayist and waterfall. A reminder that form and method may not be found at my desk in front of my computer. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková The absolute joy of this piece belies the clarity of its argument and the amount of research which has gone into it. And I am definitely staying tuned for the ‘Home Improvement’ instalment in the series. ON BEING ’WITH’ NORMAL PEOPLE by Catherine Fowler This video essay plays so beautifully with the tension of proximity, of closeness, of being ‘with’, and then of course of being without. On Listening by Pavitra Sundar Fascinating to listen to (and watch) and consider the mediating nature of the listening experience; listening on listening on listening, and indeed listening to listening to listening. Associate Professor, Queens College/CUNY and co-editor of [in]Transition The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková This is exemplary media archaeology and a reminder of the whimsy of programming decisions. Bride of Frankenstein [film|minutes] — interactive version by Shane Denson Slowness is the antidote to a constructed life; a tool to reorganise the parts. Another Delicious Story by Karin Shankar We make images from images made by others. And sometimes they’re your kids. Giallo by Matt Miller AI bad. Code good. Sharing tools and methods is the way. The Video Essay About The Show by Jason Mittell Form runs through the wringer. Freelance film curator, researcher, and cultural worker In assembling this list, I was guided by a principle articulated last year by my esteemed colleague Julian Ross: “Essay films = video essays.” Without denying the heuristic or aesthetic value of online videographic criticism, I chose to focus on a more immersive encounter with essayistic thought – namely, in cinemas and contemporary art spaces. In a world whose condition increasingly resembles a catastrophe, gaining access to such experiences is becoming ever more difficult (at least for me, an unemployed immigrant), and thus all the more precious. Perhaps a reaction to this same world-condition underlies the mixture of melancholy and incisive critical thinking that permeates most of the films I selected. As the literary scholar Mikhail Epstein once wrote, the essay form is marked by “uncertainty and brazenness, the sadness of an exile and the audacity of a wanderer.” Each of the five films follows this fluctuating artistic strategy in its own way, reflecting on the maladies and peculiarities of our time. Each resonates deeply with my current state of mind. Evidence by Lee Anne Schmitt If the essay’s key strength is its critical potential, then questioning contemporary power structures becomes one of its essential tasks. This film embodies that brilliantly: a brilliant, penetrating investigation of American neoconservatism. BLKNWS: Terms & Conditions by Kahlil Joseph One of the most spectacular films of 2025, together with an inventive and multifaceted reflection on contemporary Black culture. Family Constellation with a Fox by Gernot Wieland Combining a Benjaminian poetic tone, intellectual clarity, personal mythologies and wonderful ceramic figures, this work struck me as both piercing and uplifting. New Old Homeland by Taniguchi Akihiko One of the year’s best machinima essay films, offering a deep and humorous reflection on the increasingly prominent virtual worlds shaped by game engines. Hostile Landscapes by Zhang Hanwen This is a wonderful example of a slow-paced, dual-channel essay film that subtly enhances the viewer’s sense of agency. I especially appreciate the attunement between my gaze and the filmmaker’s calm exploration of a landscape beneath which lie layers of colonial history and mechanisms of power. Technologist and creator of cinematic essays who teaches coding for media studies at Columbia University and works in Technology at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Many of my nominations emerged from a course I designed and still teach at Columbia University’s School of the Arts. Nearly all of last year’s cohort had no prior knowledge of video essays or even nonlinear editing, yet they produced exceptional work that earned recognition beyond the classroom. Two of them spoke and screened their films at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival, and two video essays are forthcoming in an upcoming issue of In Media Res. Their work demonstrates the medium’s capacity to function as scholarship, criticism, and art. Trapped on a Pedestal by Sam Gordon Gordon’s close visual reading of John Cassavetes’ A Woman Under the Influence is simultaneously sublime and evocative. While the ultra-widescreen is a treat for the eyes, its clever sound design shouldn’t be missed: listen with headphones. CAROL (2015): Discontinuity in the Pursuit of Jean Epstein’s Photogénie by Lily Cummings Cummings’ close examination of Todd Haynes’ 2015 film Carol with Epstein’s enigmatic Photogénie blends a cinematic style through an academic lens. Agnes’ Song by Chengkangjie (Eric) Huang How can you portray the difficult subject of ‘comfort women’ in audiovisual form? Huang succeeded in this film that is haunting, yet respectful to the survivors and their stories. Gleaning Reflection by Gracie Hecht Hecht uses both literal and metaphorical mirrors and lenses in her meditation on the reflexive mode of filmmaking employed by Agnès Varda’s The Gleaners and I (2000). Hecht was one of my students who was granted access to Varda’s archives, and invited to accompany the screening of her video essay at the Cannes Film Festival this year. (Untitled) by Committee of Affairs (CoA) The anonymous artist Committee of Affairs (CoA) produces for both TikTok and Instagram. Their reels tend to have a style, which are all acquired content from other sources, mostly other users and films. The clips usually begin with an opening clip of a user speaking directly to us, then a wave of music and moving images, ending with an image of text that often speeds by too quickly to read. The genre is either hopecore or corecore, depending on the video and your mood. This reel feels like corecore as it pierces through layers of the human condition on the rhythm of Radiohead’s Exit Music. What’s also worth further examination is how the same reel is received differently amongst users on different platforms. Effect becomes affect … depending on the audience affected. This work reveals that algorithmically-circulated montage doesn’t have a stable affect. It becomes a different object through the sorting algorithms, comment culture, and the base of users. Instagram users skew towards a phenomenological intensity, while TikTok users articulate melancholia for the same video. By making algorithmic mediation visible through cross-platform distribution, CoA transforms the montage into an analytical argument about how digital infrastructure shapes feeling. Database Gleaning by Andrea De Bedout De Bedout’s moving cinematic video essay is a blend of poetic and desktop documentary modes. We watch her mine The Gleaners and I (2000) dailies database revealing details of the filmmaking process. She shows us connections between the footage, archive, and interface, bringing in Lev Manovich as an interlocutor. Interface icons become moving images, buttons become prompts, themes become filenames. We see the act of gleaning of a gleaner. Like Hecht, De Bedout was invited to speak and screen her film at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. josh (with parentheses) is a video essayist who attempts to make complex, compelling arguments in the stupidest possible ways. He sometimes succeeds at the first part, but is pretty reliable for the second. The Real Story Behind the Backrooms by Kendra Gaylord I do not care even a tiny bit about architecture, the focus of Kendra Gaylord’s work, but I will never miss a single one of her videos. The Real Story Behind the Backrooms is a perfect example of why: architecture is, to her, something humans do that can help us understand humans. It is a story about the architectural history of a building, and also the emergence of a meme, and also about how a very generous man gave a lot to the internet and the least we can do is help him fix his roof. Why Milchick’s Story Hurts So Much: Black Survival in White Workplace by Afrodizjha Afrodizjha’s close appreciation of Tramell Tillman’s bravura performance as Mr. Milchick on Severance helped me understand Milchick as illustrative of the ways in which Blackness is controlled and repressed in white-dominated corporate spaces. Being a YouTuber Bankrupted Me by Innuendo Studios The first thing to say about this choice is that Ian Danskin’s work as Innuendo Studios is consistently phenomenal, from top to bottom and without exception. On Nebula, he is currently working on a series of short game reviews that construct a historical framework for the genre; I would find it shocking if others did not include this year’s The South Bank of the Rubicon among their poll responses; and his The Alt-Right Playbook series represents some of the most powerful and instructive analysis of the rhetorical manipulations that have enabled the rise of fascism over the last few decades. When Danskin published this video, he had nearly half a million subscribers and a well-earned reputation as one of the best and most thoughtful essayists on YouTube. He was, by most metrics of the platform, extremely successful. And yet, the title. I choose this essay for two reasons. First, I think Danskin’s experience highlights some of the major systemic problems facing working essayists on YouTube. There are plenty of essayists in similar positions, essayists who are doing remarkable work that is engaging their audience and drawing traffic to YouTube, and who are yet unable to sustain that work financially. Second, because Danskin’s GoFundMe hit *double* its goal within two days. Reading the comments both on the video and on the GFM shows how deeply and how well Danskin is loved and appreciated by his community, and how ready his audience was to step up and support him. It is easy to feel bleak, as a video essayist on YouTube in 2025, about the prospects of making a channel sustainable. This video showcases the difficult truth of that situation. The creators are showing up and doing phenomenal work. The audience is there ready and willing to support those creators. But the systems that creators need to enable their labor are not doing enough to keep them going. Defying Gravity | Synchronized Roller Coasters (Wicked) by Tube Cody I get made fun of a lot as having a somewhat chaotic definition of essay, but I’m sticking to my guns on this one: this roller coaster is a video essay. A lot of video essays come from a film background, and use the tools of filmmaking to develop their ideas. But those aren’t the only tools available to us! Sometimes we can make meaning through roller coaster design. And if you’re not convinced, listen to him talk about how and why he made the choices that he did. Video essayist on YouTube and Nebula who often uses video games as a springboard to speak about larger topics of art, philosophy, and politics. His first book, How a Game Lives, is available now from all major booksellers. This year, I’ve been thinking about the different generations of mainstream YouTube video essayists. While the first wave of YouTube essayists may have been inspired by film, television, and/or written essays, many popular 2025 creators are young enough that they grew up alongside the video essay. This younger cohort has been presented a goal that didn’t previously exist! While the first generation of essayists may have turned to YouTube in an attempt to ‘do something’ with their film and philosophy degrees, younger creators may indeed pursue certain fields of study with the goal of disseminating this knowledge as a video essayist. While the goal of becoming a YouTuber can result in a passion for algorithmic success over academic rigor, this new generation is also willing to push the boundaries of the familiar form, creating more ambitious and stylistically striking projects. Trans Day of Vanishing by Lily Alexandre The best video essay of the year, Alexandre’s work melds text and form in a dizzyingly ambitious trip through an unspeakably awful question: should trans people reduce their social visibility in an act of self-preservation? The essay itself, shot in extreme widescreen, builds a sense of paranoia – Alexandre herself only takes up a fraction of the scene and the urban landscape, cold and artificially lit, stretches out beyond her. It’s a testament to the video’s magnitude that Alexandre literally being tear gassed on the streets of Montreal is only its second most striking scene. The most striking is when she taps into the feed of a public surveillance camera, finding production quality in the constant, unwilling scrutiny she lives under. The 25 Best Films of 2024: A Video Countdown by David Ehrlich A countdown of the best films of 2024, sans traditional script or voiceover, seems outside the realm of typical video essay. And yet, Ehrlich’s 23-minute montage isn’t just a countdown but a conversation made through editing, a weaving together of hundreds of cinematic motifs from an entire year. The montage finds constant moments of delight in juxtaposition: the overture features scenes of Anora, Megalopolis, Dune, Challengers, and dozens more all choreographed together to a song from The Greatest Showman. I Saw the TV Glow functions as a meta-framing device throughout the montage – Justice Smith looks directly into the camera and intones “I watched these tapes over and over again, but they never got old.” The choice of musical accompaniment is, also, revelatory. In one standout sequence, Ehrlich introduces Nosferatu alongside Dion’s ‘My Heart Will Go On’, only to continue the song through his next pick, The Beast, finally climaxing alongside Dion with Challengers. The track is hilarious, yes, but also exactly captures the thematic core of each film. However, it’s the finale of the piece that cements it as Ehrlich’s best work so far. The crescendo seems to come early; after Anora (his #3 pick), the montage escalates into an ecstasy of scenes and sounds and emotion set to an epic rework of Madonna’s ‘Like a Prayer’. And when it seems the montage can rise no higher… it doesn’t. It crashes back down to Earth with the sparse harmonica of Springsteen’s The Promised Land and Ehrlich’s final two picks, No Other Land and Nickel Boys. An impossible level of craft throughout. Death of the Author: An Alan Wake Series Retrospective by Noah Caldwell-Gervais Much as series protagonist Alan Wake can’t help but spiral around his own universe of autofiction, Noah Caldwell-Gervais is helplessly drawn back to developer Remedy’s series of games. Having previously covered Alan Wake, Max Payne, and Control on his channel, Gervais now revisits each along a gargantuan journey to understand the layers of meaning woven throughout Alan Wake 2. Although the runtimes of many video essays have ballooned over the years, only Gervais is capable of keeping his writing on-target and engaging for nearly 200 minutes straight. And as Alan Wake 2 snakes through the themes of nearly every Remedy game, longtime fans of Gervais’ channel will see how this retrospective engages with many of his defining interests: Horror and noir, self-loathing writers, King’s Dark Tower series, goofy Rock and Roll stars. Gervais’ channel seemed incomplete without an essay on Alan Wake – and Alan Wake 2 itself seemed incomplete without an analysis by Gervais. Finally, both are settled. Art critic Backlot Connections by John Gibbs By juxtaposing filming locations and set designs, this video essay reveals the unseen ties between characters from different films and the unexpected thematic connections among them. It becomes a special cinematic space where these characters live, pass by one another, and perhaps even meet. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková By exploring the extinct star wipe film transition and its notorious history, the video essay transforms into a study in experimental media archaeology, revealing how this anachronistic artefact can still be relevant and useful today. Painful Cinephilia: Daney, Rivette, Video and Kapó by Alan O’Leary (OuScholPo) This video essay enters the ethical realm of Holocaust representation in cinema and creatively addresses the problem of unrepresentability: how to talk about a film that “no one has seen” and yet “no one has forgotten”? The Anthropocene Will Eat Itself by Cormac Donnelly We are living closer to the outbreak of a global/nuclear war than at any time since the Cold War. Yet, video essays reflecting on this are scarce. Cormac Donnelly, exploring the theme of the Anthropocene, conveys a similar sense of threat and destruction by applying the metaphor of cannibalism, media emulations, archives, and the form of an immersive trailer. Overturning Carmen’s feminicide: Materializing women’s agency through the musical by Barbara Zecchi This video essay reimagines the myth of Carmen from a feminist perspective. It stands out for its distinctive structure and form. Its tactile treatment of the material underscores its subversion of patriarchal traditions and narratives, while the ticking clock serves as a constant reminder that, in the real world, a woman is killed every ten minutes as a result of gender-based violence. gestures of thought: glance by Johannes Binotto Jean Epstein’s shimmering close-ups are boldly combined with the video essayist’s own personal archive and his wonderful music, lending the work additional sensitivity as it reflects on the elusive cinematic poetics of “shimmering images”. The Thinking Machine #95: Boro(que) Aesthetics by Cristina Álvarez López and Adrian Martin Guided by Malcolm de Chazal’s Plastic-Sense aphorisms, this video essay allows us to see Walerian Borowczyk’s Immoral Women (1979) as one might contemplate a painter’s work. And it effectively conveys Chazal’s idea that “everything on earth is sensuously connected to everything else.” Filmmaker, researcher, and lecturer in Videographic Criticism at the University of Leeds Making Fiction Flow by Melanie Bell & Catherine Grant Sirens by Nan Goldin (dis)Orientating Horror: Feeling Queerly by Lucy Fife Donaldson Shadow Self: On Agnès Varda’s Documenteur by Sadia Quraeshi Shepard Ordinatrices: About the Negative Spaces of Early Computing by Occitane Lacurie Black & Arab Encounters on Screen by Abiba Coulibaly Freelance film scholar and video essayist. Newly elected Fellow of the British Academy As it gets harder and harder to select only seven videos for this poll, as in the last years, I have used three parameters in the composition of my list: I had to choose works by different essayists from those for whom I voted in 2024; and my selection could only feature personal favourites in the field of videographic criticism, that is, a specific film, television and screen studies subset of the ‘video essay’. The videos also needed to be already published and freely available online, which ruled out some great works for which I will undoubtedly be voting next year. Epilogue: Remembered Video by Alan O’Leary Alan’s characteristically brilliant, generous and superbly performed, filmed and edited audiovisual work (published in December 2024) was a commissioned response to The Personal Mediascape in the Age of Videographic Heterotopias, a cluster of ten videos and statements published in ASAP/J (the journal of the Association for the Study of the Arts of the Present) and curated by Joel Burges and Allison Cooper. The prompt for the cluster was Victor Burgin’s understanding of cinema as a kind of personal heterotopia (a fragmentary internal playlist or mediascape) constituted by the physical, virtual, and psychical ways in which we encounter it. As well as responding to this prompt and the videos which explored it in the main body of the issue, Epilogue: Remembered Video wonderfully articulates and exemplifies a method for videographic criticism and for humanistic criticism as such. Everyone interested in Videographic Criticism for scholarly purposes should watch it and the ten amazing videographic works with which it entered into conversation: Preliminary Notes for Thinking About a Place by Catalina Segú; Potbelly by Dayna McLeod; Fred Astaire’s Cane Hits My Brain by Will DiGravio; The Bijou Room by Desirée J. Garcia; The Uneasiness of Being a Subject: Queriendo sin querer by Jeffrey Romero Middents; Atmospheres of History in Larisa Shepitko’s Films by Viktoria Paranyuk; Epitaph for Sonja 1: Body/Archive/Movement by Amanda Doxtater; Shadow Self: On Agnès Varda’s Documenteur by Sadia Quraeshi Shepard; Desidentificación by Maillim Santiago; and Alterity Onscreen: A Gen-X Mediascape by Allison Cooper. Uncontaining Horror: 20th Century Spanish Women’s Meshes of Fear by Barbara Zecchi Published in December 2024 in the Spanish audiovisual essay journal Tecmerin. Revista de Ensayos Audiovisuales, Barbara’s video is one of the most original and powerful scholarly video essays I have watched, making an argument about women’s film authorship that really counts. Using two concepts from horror cinema as a theoretical framework – Eugenie Brinkema’s “genrelessness” and Jane Gaines’s “uncontainment” – Uncontaining Horror reinterprets films by 20th-century Spanish women directors that have not traditionally been classified as horror, offering a broader and certainly much less androcentric understanding of the genre. Not at Home by Deborah Martin Debbie’s video is a short but fabulously assembled split screen video essay that compares sequences from two films, The Innocents (Jack Clayton, 1951) and Portrait of a Lady on Fire (Céline Sciamma, 2019), emphasising correspondences in the dynamics of space, gender, and movement in the films, and in their use of gothic conventions. It was published by [in]Transition: Journal of Videographic Film and Moving Image Studies, alongside brilliantly insightful reviews by Alison Peirse and Benjamin Sampson, in a double issue overflowing with remarkable works. I have singled it out as for me it is the perfect study of two of my all-time favourite films and is very much a video I will watch again and again, and would have loved to have made myself. I can’t wait for more of Debbie’s highly original videographic studies of space, uncanniness, queerness and horror to be published. (dis)Orientating Horror: Feeling Queerly by Lucy Fife Donaldson Lucy’s work is always brilliant and this video (deserved winner of the audiovisual essay competition at the Marienbad Film Festival in 2025) is both strikingly and uncannily so. Importantly, it succeeds in its aim of exploring the videographic form as a queer methodology. Departing from some of Lucy’s observations about space in Midsommar (Ari Aster, 2019), and using a variety of videographic editing techniques (multiscreen, image flipping, and mirroring, repetition, looping, reversing direction) as well as filming new material, her work takes up Sara Ahmed’s spatial understanding of queerness from her book, Queer Phenomenology, as she explains to great effect in her remarkable accompanying maker’s statement. Published in December 2024, ‘(dis)Orienting horror: feeling queerly’ is part of an extremely rich (first ever videographic) special issue on ‘Queer/ing Horror’, published by the Canadian horror journal Monstrum, guest edited by artist and video essayist extraordinaire Dayna McLeod, which also features amazing videographic work by Felicia Cosey (Jouissance at the Margins: Revisiting Bersani’s Is the Rectum a Grave? Through the Lens of Swallowed), Alex Hall (Lick the Blade: Locating a Queer Archive of Debris in Roberta Findlay’s The Oracle), Max Ranieri (We’re All Scrolling Through the World’s Fair: Online Horror Fiction as a Site of Queer Identity Formation), Heather O. Petrocelli and May Santiago (Queer + Horror), Ada Rosen (Inside(s) Out), Julia Erhart and Susan Bruce (Decentering Monstrosity in The Children’s Hour (1961)), Darren Elliott-Smith (Every creak, every groan, every tap in the wall, you’ll think of me: Spinning the Web of Trans*-Horror Metaphors in Cobweb (2023)), and Alison Peirse (I Can Hear Someone Coming). The Video Essay About The Show by Jason Mittell For me, 2024–25 saw a surge in what might be regarded as ‘feature film length’ audiovisual essay projects, or certainly ones which, in their length, production ambitions and sometimes budgets, far exceeded the scope of most scholarly videographic work. Several examples of this trend are Christian Keathley’s hugely compelling 2024 work Cinephilia and History, or The Mystery of William Keighley, and Kevin B. Lee’s recently premiered urgent and fascinating desktop documentary Afterlives (Germany-Belgium-France 2025), Lúcia Nagib’s fabulously hybrid essay film/audiovisual essay Films to Die For (2025), as well as Steve Anderson’s recent film Reality Frictions. None of these are yet publicly viewable online, so remain beyond the scope of my selection. By far my favourite publicly available online work of extended scope is Jason Mittell’s amazing videographic serial project, a brilliant follow up to his recent reflexive study of Nathan Fielder’s TV show The Rehearsal. This time, he focuses on The Show About The Show, a webseries by filmmaker Caveh Zahedi that documents his life and the process of making the series. Jason’s project is at the cutting edge, both of video-essaying and academic research by practice, here, the practice of reflexive imitation of media works. It’s also extremely funny, highly ambitious, and very thought-provoking and original on the politics and ethics of contemporary nonfiction ‘film’making. Jason’s essential and informative introduction to the work is online here. A Tale of Two Desktops: The First Czech Films in Parallel Worlds by Jiří Anger, Veronika Hanáková, and Jiří Žák It’s been another great year for the dynamic videographic duo Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková, who also published the remarkable and hilarious work The Return of the Star Wipe at [in]Transition in June 2025. I also love their important and formally innovative collaboration with Jiří Žák on Czech cinema made for the Audiovisual Approaches and the Archive Dossier published by MOVIE: A Journal of Film Criticism. Focusing on three films, 26 frames, and a single GIF, A Tale of Two Desktops proposes a new vision of archival film, one that builds on and departs from Jiří Anger’s award-winning 2024 book Towards a Film Theory from Below: Archival Film and the Aesthetics of the Crack-Up. Like the earlier video essays I have selected for this year’s poll, this work is a model of creative scholarship, in other words, it is the result of a disciplined process, using artistic as well as intellectual methods, for creating credible knowledge that can receive and withstand critical scrutiny, and which is able to be built upon by others as it itself has built on earlier studies. The Thinking Machine #93: Longing by Cristina Álvarez López and Adrian Martin Last but far from least, I have selected Longing, one of the many dozens of amazing works by the longstanding masters of film criticism in audiovisual essay form, Cristina Álvarez López and Adrian Martin, in their ongoing collaboration for the online Dutch film magazine Filmkrant. It was hard to single out just one work by them from 2025, but I really loved this one about the striking similarities between two films starring Tilda Swinton, 35 years apart: Friendship’s Death (Peter Wollen, 1987) and Three Thousand Years of Longing (George Miller, 2022). Like those two films, Longing is a beautiful, powerful and insightful work. Assistant Professor at IULM University and co-editor of [in]Transition Every year it becomes increasingly difficult to keep up with the many fascinating works that are published online, presented at public events such as festivals and showcases, and so on. Choosing personal favourites is even harder. This list includes some of the works that have most prompted me to reflect, inspired me, and opened up new research possibilities for me. Making Fiction Flow by Melanie Bell & Catherine Grant As someone interested in women’s labour in film production, I was truly struck by the inventive and surprising ways Grant and Bell find to explore and visually convey the work of script supervisor Penny Eyles. The Video Essay About The Show by Jason Mittell In this series, Jason Mittell experiments by adopting certain formal traits of the object he analyses – seriality and self-reflexivity – in clever and original ways, thus devising a complex and innovative methodological approach Afterlives by Kevin B. Lee Afterlives is a feature film and, given its production value, perhaps shouldn’t be on this list. Still, it represents the most accomplished outcome of an aesthetic and methodology Lee has developed in his practice as a video essayist. It is both a theoretical reflection on the image and a moving, profound meditation on the limits of the visible. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková The research Jiří and Veronika are conducting on the archaeology of video technology and the early years of digital media is truly compelling. By focusing on marginal and eccentric forms within the history of audiovisual technology, they reveal the intricate ties between aesthetics, technology, and the economics of the moving image. Backlot Connections by John Gibbs Some years ago, the work of Mark Rappaport and his book The Secret Life of Moving Shadows sparked in me a fascination not only for studio backlots and props histories, but also for the video essay as a tool capable of making invisible connections visible and accessible. This is precisely what John Gibbs achieves, with precision and elegance, in Backlot Connections. Locarno parla italiano – 404!: Glitching Locarno Film Festival by Silvia Cipelletti and Evelyn Kreutzer The video essay speaks Italian! I watched Silvia and Evelyn develop this project brilliantly during a workshop in Locarno, and the way they turned obstacles into creative opportunities is incredibly clever. AV essayist and media scholar, and researcher of gimmicky artefacts Potential of sketches, playfulness of research questions, unexpected conclusions from close readings, ephemeral phenomena, as well as work that enters the territory of violent imagery. Research in videographic scholarship and the essay film form does not operate within fixed or predetermined boundaries. My picks reflect this, in no particular order. Vampire Optics by Allan Cameron From Kittler’s reading of vampires in relation to recording and copying technologies such as the typewriter and the phonograph, to Shane Denson’s analysis of Frankenstein and the advent of sound in moving pictures, or Jiří Anger’s reading of early films in which a spliced and re-glued frame in an analogue strip produces a Frankensteinian moment at the levels of both materiality and perception, I have developed a deep appreciation for understanding monsters (their bodies, powers, and vulnerabilities) as inseparable from the media that shape them. Cameron’s audiovisual essay traces vampires along a similar path, yet refuses to stop at the boundaries of medium specificity. Instead, it follows the screen vampire’s unique relationship with light, thus revealing an interconnected network of ‘vampire optics’: mirrors, shadows, shimmer, focus, flicker, and more. The video essay is connected to Cameron’s Visceral Screens: Mediation and Matter in Horror Cinema; you can watch the essay first and then read the book, or reverse the order. Afterlives by Kevin B. Lee The Medusa of Hatra becomes a single image that opens up an entire network of interconnected questions about who has the right to know, to protect, and to use cultural heritage. It sits at the crossroads of ISIS propaganda, violent imagery, the politics of digital archives, and the ethics of remembering. It forces us to ask: Who is being remembered, by whom, and by what means? Who shapes the narrative, and who is shaped by it? Underlying these questions is a deeper one: where does agency reside, and where does it dissolve into forms of being interpreted, mediated, or spoken for by others? For Kevin, vulnerability does not arise merely from viewing a brutal or violent image. It comes from navigating the tensions and voices that gather around these questions, existing within an ever-evolving discourse of power… The film stands as the culmination of years of filmmaking and research, and it is a film well worth seeing. Also read Seeing without Seeing – Towards a Generative Archival Practice. Toute la data du monde by Evelyn Kreutzer A connection emerges with the voice-over from Alain Resnais’s Toute la mémoire du monde, which reflects on the library as a system of memory. Evelyn extends this parallel by proposing a way of approaching AI as a system that not only structures memory but actively produces it. This idea resonates with Kevin’s Afterlives, especially in the section where AI appears as the only remaining archive of certain (here, extremist) images. The audiovisual essay therefore positions AI not merely as a tool of image production but as a system of knowledge, power, and memory that demands investigation. It suggests that we should not be intimidated by these black-box, seemingly shiny tools, but instead look closely at what lies within them. Good to pair with Silvia Cipelletti’s piece Memoria Algoritmica. For a broader context, one might go to see Alan Warburton’s Wizard of AI. Imaging Orphée / Orphée imaginé by Jenny Oyallon-Koloski What if Jacques Demy had made Parking differently? Imaging Orphée plays with this alternative past, through editing, remixing, and counterfactual speculation, it explores how his 1985 queer musical might have taken another form. In dialogue with Demy’s style and contemporary media, a new Orpheus emerges, singing across time and cultures. Drawing on an eclectic corpus and on what we know of Demy’s craft, Imaging Orphée uses videographic means to envision how the past itself might have unfolded otherwise, a mode of analysis that becomes an act of playful reinvention. If the piece invites us to re-imagine other films, then it is an invitation worth accepting. A Life of Its Own: American Psycho by Sara Bezovšek A reconfiguration of a film and its afterlife (through memes, videos, ads, and other artefacts) into the single frame of a web browser, forming one associative stream, a never-ending analysis. I would love to see more similar analytical work that unfolds within the scope of a single virtual window or a single frame, much like how TikTok or an Instagram Reel can operate, as Hysterical Melancholy / Cyber Trash does for digital nostalgia. Comedy Objects #1: Slapstick Speculation by Noah Teichner When you are watching film comedies, what do you focus on? The predicaments of the main character, the misbehaviour of everything around them, the jokes? Noah focuses on Hollywood film comedies from the 1930s. To do so, he is able to connect the humour and the language (the delivery of the jokes) to the omnipresence of the financial crisis. A close reading of figures of speech, gesture, and music places film comedies less in the realm of frivolous slips of the tongue and more within the logic of the system, financial system. In researching the history and phenomenon of slapstick comedies, this essay pairs nicely with Petr Král’s Le Burlesque ou Morale de la tarte à la crème, even though they approach the subject from slightly different perspectives. Published as part of a special issue of the journal Images secondes on Cinema and Financial Speculation (edited by Occitane Lacurie and Barnabé Sauvage). Television Still Delivers People: Re-Creating the 1973 Video Manifesto by Richard Serra and Carlotta Fay Schoolman through Multiple Screens and Various Media by Jaap Kooijman About our relationship to the screen, about our subjectivity and agency, and about the very idea of a mass medium; about the fact that there is not just one television screen but many, and whether ‘mass’ even remains a meaningful category. A playful media-archaeological sketch, not yet published. Presented as a work-in-progress at NECS 2025. Video essayist Part Time Video Essayist Full Time Video Essay Enjoyer You are a better writer than AI. (Yes, you.) by josh (with parentheses) With the rise of AI in the past few years, I have seen many coworkers, friends and family members all sort of ‘give up’ when it comes to the small amount of writing they are challenged with. This video really tackles this trend and comes from a unique position of a teacher who still believes in his students. Also there’s a part which mentions Baby Gronk that made me cry, which is definitely the only time that will happen (I hope). You Are into Mousetrap YouTube by Big Joel “And you may ask yourself, ‘Well, how did I get here?’” These words really struck me in David Byrne’s True Stories, Big Joel’s You are into Mousetrap Youtube struck me in a very similar way. The internet is a wide and weird place and we all find ourselves in unique and specific rabbit holes. You are likely not into Mousetrap Youtube but there’s something in its place that fascinates you. You Seem Like You Wouldn’t Clap for Tinkerbell by Afterthoughts A very raw essay about someone’s own struggle wrestling with their belief that I would imagine everyone with a loved one they’ve lost can relate to. Impressively it was all written, filmed and edited for a 48 hour collab. What’s Stopping You? (Spoiler: It’s You) by Nathan Zed Brilliant editing, tight writing, and a warm reminder to nourish that same child-like passion you had for something in the first place. Another classic. A Video Essay About Efficiency by Pillar of Garbage A clever video essay metaphor used to tackle what is lost in shortcuts made in our everyday lives. The Musical Easter Egg in Close Encounters of the Third Kind by Kikikrazed This unlocked a connection I completely missed on my first watch of Close Encounters, it helped me further understand what Spielberg and company were going for in this film and I’m a little excited to give it a rewatch from that lens. Camp Rock Is About Food Poisoning by Indietrix A thorough analysis of Camp Rock’s haphazard portrayal of food safety done with tons of comedy and an appreciation for the profession. Media scholar and video essayist; University of Minnesota a rumble from the core of the earth by Laura Del Vecchio and Katarzyna Paszkiewicz I am beyond impressed how this video essay achieves the core mission of videographic scholarship – making a compelling, theoretically sophisticated, and novel argument both in the written statement as well as the audiovisual material. Challenging the notions of Western-centric knowledge production and perception is easier said than done; yet, the exquisite editing offers the viewer not only the space to critically reflect on but to experience what it means to “listen otherwise”. The Anthropocene Will Eat Itself by Cormac Donnelly Like in some of his other works, Donnelly’s layering of tactility – from the visual framing and the materiality of the visual and audio clips to the body horror of the depicted cannibalism – manages to create a horrifying visceral aftereffect that is simultaneously highly entertaining and deeply disturbing. Cheezit Timeline by Benedetta Andreasi I love how Andreasi’s response to technical issues creates a meditation on the intimacy and precarity of sharing one’s own creative process in the form of the editing timeline. Instead of minimising proximity, the physical embodiment of both the creator and their surroundings introduces an unexpected distance to the work – the anxiety I feel over the filled cup at the centre reflecting the refusal to let me get too close. Classif & Me (Laird’s Constraint) by Alan O’Leary A perfect example of the productive energy of constraints that invite and ultimately necessitate subversion. I have a deep appreciation for how O’Leary makes room for what he calls errors in his work that prove themselves as rich points of engagement. The video is playful yet contemplative and intellectually thought-provoking. Short film programmer, artistic leader at Go Short My picks are drawn primarily from the film festival circuit. In no particular order: Zodiac Killer Project by Charlie Shackleton Deconstructing true crime tropes with much humour, and somehow still making it a thrilling true crime watch. The Flowers Stand Silently, Witnessing by Theo Panagopoulos Very powerful archive essay; by recontextualising images creating a space to reflect on the oppression of Palestinian people. Daria’s Night Flowers by Maryam Tafakory Maryam Tafakory delivering her annual banger; this time with some breathtaking colours. happiness by Fırat Yücel How to carry the weight of the world’s pain when it’s constantly live-broadcast to our screens; no one can sleep until everyone is free. A Reconnaissance by Stefan Kruse With each film Stefan Kruse is diving deeper into the world of surveillance. This time he’s so invested he even steps away from his computer, finding himself at a Maltese airport standing alongside plane spotters to capture images of a covert drone. Abortion Party by Julia Mellen More like a video column maybe? Film curator and lecturer at Geneva University of Art and Design (HEAD), where she gives a course on the power of representation in contemporary cinema with a focus on gender, decolonial and ecological studies. These works expand the territory of the essay film, one in which individual subjectivities operate as critical lenses onto broader socio-political structures. Mobilising strategies drawn from archival material, autofiction, forensic aesthetics, and postcolonial critique, the films interrogate the conditions under which memory, identity, and power are created. The works foreground the essay film as a site of epistemological resistance: a cinematic practice that both questions dominant narratives and experiments with the forms through which knowledge itself can be constructed, destabilised, and reclaimed. Daria’s Night Flowers by Maryam Tafakory This film is a lyrical, politically charged meditation in which a young woman’s first love story with a woman blooms amid the shadows of state violence, weaving intimate confession with the unspoken traumas of Iran’s night-gardens. The film beautifully and powerfully weaves flowers, manuscript illuminations and film excerpts that create a film of love and desire that transcends the power structures. Cold Call by Stefanie Schroeder In a personal essay on the very act of writing, the filmmaker meets digital scam culture, transforming an intrusive phone call into an unexpected portrait of vulnerability, creative paralysis, and accidental resistance. Stefanie Schroeder’s film questions the intimate through cyber vigilantism, racism and power relationships. The rhythm of her film is particularly interesting as her personal story develops in parallel to the person on the other side of the line. Sixty-Seven Milliseconds by Fleuryfontaine This forensic, hybrid investigation traces the path of a single bullet through motion capture and CGI, exposing the distortions of policing and the politics embedded in every frame of surveillance. Fleuryfontaine’s (Antoine Fontaine and Galdric Fleury) film resonates a lot with recent violent events that happened in Switzerland. Nsala by Mickael-Sltan Mbanza The film is a haunting use of colonial archives that merges silence, fiction, and contemporary imagery to reclaim erased histories and rehumanise those frozen in exploitative imagery. Mickael-Sltan Mbanza plays with colonial archives and contemporary footage to fictionally recount the story of a couple recruited to work in a mine under colonial rule. I Can’t Think of Anything Right Now by Hussen Ibraheem A rain-soaked, metaphysical road film where a simple ride slips into a dreamlike detour through memory, exile, and the fragile boundaries between forgetting and survival. In Hussen Ibraheem’s film, water carries the past and the future of those who are trapped in between memories and exile. Abortion Party by Julia Mellen Abortion Party is a chaotic, irreverent autobiographical film that turns a fraught reproductive decision into an absurd, messy celebration of chosen family, bad timing, and the dark comedy of youth. Julia Mellen’s film is witty and opens up to new ways of celebrating dark times. Lost Songs of Sundari by Sudarshan Sawant The film proposes a gentle, elegiac triptych of voices reflecting on Mumbai’s shifting shorelines, capturing the quiet vanishing of coastal worlds reshaped, almost erased, by relentless urban expansion. Sudarshan Sawant creates an essay where the living and the non-living find a common space in an ever reshaping landscape. Video essayist and music producer under the name Kai After Kai. Also producer, co-writer, and composer for the horror fiction podcast Kingscreek The Most Boring Place in Tears of the Kingdom? by Any Austin Video games, perhaps by nature, tend to be pretty goal/purpose oriented. One of the first things you might ask about that game is “what do you DO in it?” But recently I’ve found myself developing a sort of fondness for moments in games that give me the opportunity to simply do ‘nothing’ – games that have things with no ‘purpose’ or ‘meaning’, but simply ‘are’. This video by Any Austin echoes that growing fascination – a video that explores areas in the Zelda game Tears of the Kingdom that objectively have no practical gameplay purpose, but nonetheless have their own value in spite of that due to simply being there. From helping enhance an adventure game’s roleplaying elements to helping to curate a sense of player expectation and anticipation, it’s clear that moments like these have merit in gaming, and I’m glad to see it explained so well. The Opposite of Cosmic Horror by Tale Foundry It’s a real mark of quality and impact when a work changes the way I think about and process the world, even if in the most minute way. As a massive fan and now creator of cosmic horror, I’m used to dreaming up concepts and monsters far larger than any one person could ever imagine or even process, but this video exposed to me how that feeling can, ironically, still lead to a form of anthropocentrism. Rarely do we give much thought to those smaller than us — much smaller — who might look up at us and feel their sense of scale and understanding of the universe fall out from under them. The pests that scurry between our walls, the vermin that hide in our corners, the objects of so much fear and hate from ourselves, but have we ever really considered how they feel? Have *I* ever considered how they feel when I cast my shadow over them and, without a second thought, end their existence and continue like they were simply nothing? I can say that I do. Now. When Death Note Broke Its Own Rules by Sloan Stowe Part of why I make videos could be said to be ‘obsession’. That is to say, my videos are born from feelings when something, no matter how big or small, crawls over my brain, leaving its impact all over as it grasps my mind and refuses to let go. In that sense, I think I may have found a kindred spirit. Sloan spends half an hour examining a scene less than a fifth of that length, but not a single second is wasted. Every one is filled with some kind of analysis of cinematography, localisation, animation, acting, sound design, all in service of unpacking everything buried underneath these four minutes of anime characters talking in the rain. It is the kind of video born when something truly takes root in you and demands to be acknowledged, demands to be explored. It’s something I truly love to see, in myself yes, but especially in others. Video essayist (as LambHoot) and solutions architect So many video essayists leaned into irreverence this year. If you’re like me, a wave of borderline comedy essays flew through your sub feed. Many messed with tone, interlacing absurd subject matter and harsh delivery into the usual structure. In nonchalant voices, authors spread messages, opined inconclusively on difficult topics, and counted how many functional urinals there were in video games. Many of my picks showed rather than told. The medium felt so much more self-aware. I had a blast watching all of these. I Studied for My Citizenship Test with Assassin’s Creed 3 by SolidArf I’ve watched enough YouTube to know to always click any Assassin’s Creed 3 video essays that bless your timeline. SolidArf’s timely piece examines how many of the US citizenship test’s questions are answered accurately by the game’s content, and ultimately evolves into a critique of both. How Many Times Can You Pee in Heavy Rain? by Allie Meowy Genuinely the most ‘laugh out loud’ video essay this year (maybe ever). An absolutely absurd premise leads to an examination of granularity and detail in virtual worlds. Like if AVGN made video essays (I swear this is a compliment). Bluey Is Perfect, and That Terrifies Me by MML’s Commentaries Matt examines his biases as a child of separated parents, confronting his anxieties about potential parenthood. I wasn’t familiar with Bluey before this, but the video helped me understand why so many parent friends praise the show. Trans Day of Vanishing by Lily Alexandre The most ‘show, don’t tell’ video essay of the year, so much so that it literally takes your peripheral vision to watch. No other video essayist put themselves on the front line as much as Lily did this year (again, literally). A raw examination of visibility, vulnerability, and safety. Recommended post-watch read: Unlearning Shame (Devon Price, 2024). A Narrative Analysis of Space Invaders by Chariot Rider Some of my favourite videos are Chariot Rider’s. I can’t discuss this one’s subject matter without spoiling a twist that made me laugh out loud… but I can say that Chariot is the master of extracting a mile from an inch. My Quest to Uncover the Mystery of Death Stranding 2’s Porters by Writing on Games My favourite Writing on Games videos are those where he points a camera at something benign long enough for a meaningful narrative to emerge from it. By following random NPCs long after they would naturally de-spawn, Hamish highlights aspects of the world’s design he’d otherwise miss. Like watching a leaf under a microscope and remembering how alive it really is. The Real Story Behind the Backrooms by Kendra Gaylord Another terrific video I can’t possibly spoil. I didn’t know the Backrooms were real photographs until watching this, but I’m gladly less unsettled by them now. Kendra digs through blueprints and renovation documents to trace a cause-and-effect chain from a 1910s department store to the modern-day meme. Associate Professor in Audiovisual Arts and Cognition at the University of Groningen, NL / co-author of Film Studies in Motion: From Audiovisual Essay to Academic Research Video Trying to get a grip on a year’s videographic production is becoming increasingly difficult as the output grows exponentially over time. This unavoidably results in a highly personal selection (and potentially less overlap among the videos chosen by others), which is good news because it also indicates a quickly increasing videographic scene and community. Where Do You Put the Camera? by Every Frame a Painting (Taylor Ramos and Tony Zhou) Every Frame a Painting has only released a single video in 2025, which is bad news for all cinephiles who appreciate Tony Zhou’s meticulous research, clarity in argumentation, and seamless delivery, but good news for all other video essayists who will now have a chance to make it to our best-of-the-year lists. Crochet Is Sick! by Alison Peirse Delicately balancing between the subjective-personal (“when I watch horror films, I wrap myself in crochet blankets”) and the objective-scholarly (“crochet is … a portent, a warning of impending horror”), this simple but superbly edited and soundtracked supercut video makes mediated crochet almost tangible. Cineradiographic Vision by Onur Turgut The term cineradiography, which gives the project its title, underscores the capacity of imaging technologies to reveal the anatomy of cinematic space, both metaphorically, by unraveling spatial meaning, and perceptually, by disrupting visual norms. A Tale of Two Desktops: The First Czech Films in Parallel Worlds by Jiří Anger, Veronika Hanáková, Jiří Žák Do you, as a teacher of early cinema, struggle to make the audiovisual past relevant to the current generation of your students? By examining “how nitrate film materials from the beginnings of cinema – with all their weird shapes, textures, and visual quirks – survive and circulate in the digital age,” this well-researched and excellently produced hands-on film archaeological experiment offers a brilliant solution. Google Mapping Blow-Up: A Desktop Remediation by Cáit Murphy This video, which combines one of my favourite films (Blowup), activities (film-induced tourism), and videographic methods (desktop documentary), checks off many of my cinephile boxes. The ParAIax View by Ariel Avissar A shot-to-shot AI remake of the montage sequence from Alan J. Pakula’s 1974 The Parallax View is my favourite conceptual video essay of the year. Audiovisual essayists, writers, cinephiles 100 Years of History in 100 Films by kaptainkristian Reaching the year 2001 / Reaching the film 2001. From there, the timeline collapsed. Another timeline was added. And what ‘it’ showed was parallel to what we saw, or perhaps its inner face/essence. Is the inner face of 2019 Blade Runner (1982)? Is Steve Jobs 2015 or 1998… and The Matrix, which is its very, very own year itself. Reaching 2002 and 2005, following the passage through the inter-dimensional gates of Kubrick’s 2001, and Patlabor 2 followed – the iron mecha hands; the iron hands of Zuckerberg/Eisenberg that wrote our destiny – where you understand-don’t-understand where we are anymore. The transcendence of a seemingly simple idea, a seemingly simple[minded] understanding. The nervousness of the discrepancy between that year in history and the film’s production year. How masculine and phallic the century we have passed through is (if not the entire last millennium!); even Freddie Mercury in concert is along the same lines. 1979 must be Iran, right: The Masculine-Barbaline revolution. In your mind, you have the films’ production years in parallel, and aside from the simple fact that the story of many films takes place in a year different from their production year, this tells us something about ‘time’; is Blade Runner just arriving in 2019? We’ve gone way past that! Reaching the ticking seconds of the doomsday clock: The outer/inner face of these final years. All the films are beautiful here. Even all the ones you hate are redeemed here. The Matrix, Blade Runner, 2001: The electricity of these three dispersed panels. And opening with Ordet, with creator’s own signature on the image. The senses of The Silence of the Lambs by Lara Callaghan, Adam Woodward (Little White Lies) Sometimes you need a little silence to be touched. Shadow Self: On Agnès Varda’s Documenteur by Sadia Quraeshi Shepard Films are carried by the hands of their lovers [through history]; by their shadows. Associate Professor of Media Studies, University of Amsterdam Fading Echoes: Remembering and Forgetting through Videotapes by Vladimir Rosas-Salazar This audiovisual essay shows that videographic criticism can be an effective form to address media archaeology. Composed of home-made footage, Fading Echoes demonstrates how video can serve as a tool for remembering while simultaneously revealing how memories fade through the medium’s own material degradation. By foregrounding glitches, deterioration, and other traces of wear, the piece connects these visual ruptures to José van Dijck’s concept of mediated memories, emphasising not only how media shape remembrance but also how they contribute to forgetting. The result is a moving, personal, and poetic visualization of the intertwined processes through which memories are both captured and lost. Not at Home by Deborah Alexandra Martin The dual split screen, placing a sequence from one film alongside a sequence from another, is a well-established technique in videographic criticism. Consider, for example, Kogonada’s What is Neorealism? or Liz Greene’s Velvet Elephant. Not at Home fits seamlessly into this tradition, inviting a compare-and-contrast between the films The Innocents (Clayton, 1951) and Portrait of a Lady on Fire (Sciamma, 2019). By juxtaposing these (seemingly unedited) sequences with a focus on the candle as a prop, the audiovisual essay raises relevant questions about femininity and space, bringing the films into a rich dialogue that goes beyond just compare-and-contrast. Not at Home demonstrates how effective this relatively simple split-screen technique is. The History of Music Video in 169 Seconds by Mathias Bonde Korsgaard The History of Music Video in 169 Seconds is a supercut of 61 ‘canonical’ music videos, one from every year between 1964 and 2024, together presenting a history of music video in an eclectic and rapidly edited style reminiscent of the so-called MTV aesthetic – with a sidenote that the supercut is in chronological order. That these music videos are indeed canonical becomes clear, at least to me, as it takes only a snippet (both visually and audibly) to recognise them. Although the supercut itself is quite short (in fact 135 seconds rather than the stated 169 seconds), it is accompanied by a relatively extensive written text that not only clarifies the criteria for selecting the featured videos but also reflects on the scholarly need to establish a canon. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková One can easily be deceived by the playful presentation of The Return of the Star Wipe, as the voice-over and the editing adopt a tongue-in-cheek tone that mirrors the kitschy nature of the star-wipe transition itself. Yet this funny and even nostalgic presentation proves highly effective in delivering a well-researched and convincing argument in media archeology. The audiovisual essay demonstrates the added value of videographic criticism, as no written article could so effectively and vividly discuss the mechanics and cultural relevance of this admittedly tacky technique. The Return of the Star Wipe is not only a delight to watch but an illuminating and informative exploration of an often-overlooked element in media history. Postdoctoral researcher, video essayist, curator, Università della Svizzera italiana I want to make one important disclaimer: In past years, to avoid any conflict of interest, I usually abstained from nominating any pieces in which I was directly involved (as editor or consultant, for example) or by video essayists with whom I have a particularly close and current working relationship. This year, two of my nominations (by Lee and by Cipelletti) are exceptions to this rule but I believe they are warranted because they present important milestones in the larger video essay landscape with regards to videographic output’s migration into other fields of media production and consumption. Cinephilia and History, or The Mystery of William Keighley by Christian Keathley Chris Keathley’s long-form video essay/film presents three seemingly totally disparate starting points (a personal, autobiographical reflection; a local history; and a film- and industry-historical investigation) and then beautifully and affectively integrates them with each other. The film is touching, whimsical, highly informative and tonally precise, and a real template for videographic engagements with audiovisual history, memory, and lived experience. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková One of the most entertaining and original video essays of the recent past. I applaud the makers for their originality — in terms of topic (who else would think to make a video essay about a particular, largely forgotten editing transition?) and in terms of their own videographic style that is both very true to the history they lay out, and yet very recognizable in its authorial signature. It’s a great example of how the video essay can emulate, play with, and indulge in the tonal registers of its object of analysis. The Water Diaries, or My Letter to Jane by Chiara Grizzaffi A beautiful, poetic, and pensive meditation on water and film as they both move us and connect us to the world and our imaginations. Beginning with the maker’s reflections on what it means for her to be present in a specific film-institutional site (Locarno Film Festival) and connecting it (via water images and metaphors) to the oeuvre of a specific film auteur (Jane Campion), the video moves from the personal to the analytical and from the local to the global in a seamless, rhythmic flow. Why Do I Love These VICIOUS Queens? by Matt Baume Matt Baume’s videos are generally thoroughly researched, highly entertaining, and great documentaries of the (often hidden, often tumultuous) queer stories in Hollywood and mainstream media history. I like this one in particular because it picks up a personal question of taste (in the title) to go into a much larger investigation into TV history, the history of queer representation, and transatlantic media comparisons. the decline in literacy & rise in ai by silver fox A very DIY and formally simple investigation into a huge and pressing societal concern: literacy and media consumption among young people in the age of AI. Made by a gen-Z youtuber about a primarily gen-alpha phenomenon and building on the maker’s commentary and numerous social media videos and testimonials, it is an acute call for awareness that I take seriously and appreciate. Afterlives by Kevin B. Lee As I mentioned in my disclaimer, I closely work with Kevin B. Lee and have witnessed him work on this project tirelessly for several years, so I am admittedly biased. I want to stress, however, that this is a major step in video essay history – after many years of developing the desktop documentary format in the larger realm of video essay culture, Lee has now produced a feature-length documentary film that develops this methodology into a large-scale archival, media-reflexive, and politically acute investigation that is screening at major film festivals at the moment. Memoria Algoritmica by Silvia Cipelletti Here’s my second highly biased nomination – for a video essay by my colleague Silvia Cipelletti, which presents another major milestone in video essay development. Produced first for a public screening event at the Jeu de Paume, Paris, an alternative, new version of the video essay was then commissioned by Arte.tv (one of the most important and prestigious European TV channels and producers of cultural innovation). I like both versions a lot (the original video essay and the TV version) and believe they serve as great case studies to compare how the same argumentation might be adapted to different media ecologies. I applaud both Cipelletti and Arte for this transition of videographic content as it migrates from digital platforms to museum spaces to television. Video-essayist, film critic and researcher Once again, I am taking part in this list by sharing a few works which interested me – and once again, chance (and curators) played a huge role in the way I got to see them. Also, my list is less a top than an homage to videos and videasts I love. Daria’s Night Flowers by Maryam Tafakory I saw this film at FIDMarseille, in July 2025, a few months after Maryam Tafakory was given a ‘carte blanche’ retrospective dedicated to her work at Cinéma du Réel. The artist continues her patient mosaic work of reassembling Iranian cinema. The images are superimposed, altered and recoloured using a method that creates what can only be described as a style. Daria’s Night Flowers radicalises a return to onscreen text present in her previous works. The artist composes an herbarium of flowers immortalised by cinema, admired, displayed or picked by the female characters that her films habitually observe. On the editing table, these images encounter the illuminated flowers of the Kitab-e hashayish (کتاب حشايش), a pharmacological codex from 1595 with multicoloured illustrations. Abortion Party by Julia Mellen I saw this work, which pretends to be a videographic application to an artist grant at FIDMarseille too. Julia Mellen explains that she was inspired by a specific aesthetic associated with boomers’ social media habits – or rather, their Facebook habits – and their taste for dubious 3D modelling. At the edge of the frame, the director launches into a 13-minute uninterrupted story time – the length of the film – facing the camera, during which she recounts the organisation of a party to celebrate her abortion. This format of self-narrative, which originated with the video hosting platform YouTube before migrating and enjoying even greater success on TikTok, is more indicative of generations whose adolescence and young adulthood have been intertwined with digital technology. However, the setting for this performance, filmed in a single sequence shot, constantly bounces from one segment to another within a larger frame, reproducing the artist’s memories in 3D. It is difficult not to recognise, in this mechanical ballet, a screensaver from yesteryear, whose media archaeology takes us back to the DVD players of old. Thus, Julia Mellen’s stream of consciousness, which echoes the flow of her words, seems to be shaped by different layers of the artist’s technological and personal history. The personal is media, one thinks when seeing Abortion Party – since it demonstrates from the outset, through its very subject matter, how political the personal can be. Man Number 4 by Miranda Pennell I am really interested in Miranda Pennell’s filmic and videographic essays and I had the chance to see her latest piece at the Go Short Film Festival in Nijmegen. This work takes place in a single picture from which the film slowly zooms out, from a mosaic of pixels to faces, to surroundings, to context, to realisation. The process somehow reminded me of other videographic works: Capricorn Sunset by Johannes Binotto, or what remains by belit sağ, in which the constitutive particle of the image becomes the measuring unit of an invisible violence, contained within the representation. The picture was taken in December 2023 in Gaza, and shows mass deportation by the IDF of Palestinians, blindfolded, handcuffed, half-naked, almost as numerous as the pixels that concealed them. Very composed, the photograph evokes Goya’s painting, the digital encoding of visual information replacing the brushstroke, carrying the same ineffable violence. The Flowers Stand Silently, Witnessing by Theo Panagopoulos I also saw this archival essay at Go Short. This piece is also part of a growing corpus of videographic works which try to resist the visual annihilation of Palestinian history. For this film, Panagopoulos collects a 16mm botanical diary, shot by an English scientist who was commissioned to document the flora of Mandatory Palestine in the late 1930s. Accidentally – a bit like in Kamal Al Jafari’s films – Palestinians appear among the colourful fields of flowers, working, passing by, living at the edges of the frame. At the centre of the image, often, a smiling Englishman, uprooting plants with a joyful violence, which seems to contain in germ more than a century of forthcoming history. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková They already know it: I am a huge fan of Veronika and Jiří’s work, their playful and unique approach to video essay and videographic history. They represent an essential current in our community: the archaeology of videographic creation itself. This is truly a necessary and courageous work to engage with the very history of what we take for granted (or what the design thinking made us see as natural) either software-wise or hardware-wise. To engage with these crucial questions, they always find an original path, an unexpected motif, a fascinating idea: in this case, the favourite transition of every kid that once got to play with Windows Movie Maker. Afterlives by Kevin B. Lee Once again, the proof is masterfully made that video essay can exist as a feature film. I do not want to say too much about this documentary which is continuing its journey in festivals – I myself have not yet had the chance to see it on a big screen. Both through its theme, its material and its method, Afterlives manages to uncover the forensic potential of video essay and to show how this form is able to reflect upon the constant reconfiguration of the contemporary visual culture, especially in the age of AI. L’Histoire politique du festival de Locarno by Cinéma et politique I had the chance to watch Clémentine Meyer’s video essay about the Locarno Film Festival… in Locarno. Working with archival material and scale models representing the actors in this extraordinary story, the videast retraces the political, economic and cinephilic layers that form the foundation of this festival, unique in Europe. From ostpolitik to erotica, this video uncovers the strong (and unexpected) tendencies that shaped the moving identity of Locarno. Assistant Professor of Japanese Film at the University of British Columbia and video essayist This year, I was drawn to works that foreground process, of making-as-thinking, of media as something that is made. The works that inspired me invite viewers, in a variety of ways, to consider how ideas take shape. They encourage us to think about the drafts behind the draft, the gestures of selection and omission, and the rhythmic negotiations between intention and accident. Each of these works feature how video essayists can think through the act of mixing and ‘meddling’, as media scholar Ritika Kaushik puts it, and they invite us to witness and feel the stages of research and experimentation that shape them. phenomenology of marco damilano by Benedetta Andreasi Developed during the Reframing the Argument videographic workshop held at Notre Dame University (summer, 2025), the piece turns its own process into an analytic method: a deliberately off-kilter voiceover unsettles the polished aesthetic of Damilano’s Il Cavallo e la Torre, exposing how broadcast news creates a comfortable distance between viewer and ‘displaced other’. The final minute of shared silence, stripped of commentary, lands with an imperative quiet force. It is a videographic gesture that reframes spectatorship itself, inviting us to sit with what mediated discourse so often smooths over. For an even more open embrace of process, and rising to the challenge of facing disruptive difficulties, I also love Benedetta’s Cheezit Timeline, hosted on the new-this-year platform Fragments: A Journal of videographic form and method developed by Cormac Donnelly, Jemma Saunders, and Will DiGravio. Age Perfect by Dayna McLeod Age Perfect emerges directly from a community of practice that treats process as the argument itself. It is bold and brave and smart and everything I love about McLeod’s work. By entering the glossy world of anti-aging ads through performance and tactile re-creation, McLeod exposes the artifice behind beauty culture(s) and treats process not as something to be hidden but as the very site of discovery. In the spirit of Johannes Binotto’s Practices of Viewing via the Ways of Doing videographic exercise Making Materiality Matter, the maker lets the seams show, inviting us to witness how meaning emerges through trying things out on the timeline. (dis)Orientating Horror: Feeling Queerly by Lucy Fife Donaldson (dis)Orientating Horror turns videographic process into a queer methodology. Also emerging from the Ways of Doing Making Materiality Matter exercise, the piece begins with a single disorienting moment from Midsommar and uses it as a generative prompt to think through horror’s habitual orientations. On the timeline, Donaldson works through this problem materially: flipping, mirroring, looping, and multiplying the image until the refusal of the ‘straight line’ becomes something you feel in your own body. The video lets us witness that process of trying, testing the film’s gestures against an idea of embodied cinema and experimenting toward a form that inhabits disorientation rather than resolving it. (dis)Orientating Horror is part of a fantastic special issue of Monstrum on Queer/ing Horror, among them Alison Peirse’s brilliant I Can Hear Someone Coming, a counterfactual, coital collection of women’s voices from 1930s horror films. Shadow Self: On Agnès Varda’s Documenteur by Sadia Quraeshi Shepard Shadow Self treats videographic criticism as an evolving process of attachment, tracing how certain films take hold of us and accompany us through our own lived rhythms. The seeds of this project were planted at the Embodying the Video Essay workshop held at Bowdoin College in 2023, and that lineage shows: the piece embraces embodiment as a mode of inquiry through voice, gesture, memory, and caregiving. Quraeshi Shepard weaves Varda’s Documenteur together with her own personal footage and audio of parent–child conversations, allowing the interruptions and digressions of connectivity to become structural rather than something to edit out. This is a work that lets process remain visible while asking what happens when scholarship, spectatorship, and parenthood meet on the timeline. Miradas by Pablo Serrano Torres Like Donaldson’s (dis)Orientating Horror, Serrano Torres’ Miradas embodies process not as a preliminary stage but as the very substance of queer videographic thinking. A peer of Quraeshi Shepard’s Shadow Self, Miradas is a work first conceived at the 2023 Embodying the Video Essay workshop and as a project of that context we can see that the piece moves deliberately from solitary introspection to collaborative creation, making the maker’s body, voice, and relationships integral to its argument. While engaging deeply with scholarly theory, Miradas refuses the straight line of academic seriousness; its process is the product. It is messy. It is embodied. It is communal. And it is joyful. AI and ‘Being Human’ by Mariam Khaled and Mahima Jain There is, perhaps correctly, a proliferation of pieces engaging with AI. I find works that engage with the process of using AI (e.g., a transparency of prompts or a reflection of interaction) to be far more interesting than displays of results. AI and ‘Being Human’ is such an endeavour, and a stake-holding one at that. It treats the desktop documentary not simply as a mode of presentation but as a process of decolonial unlearning. It highlights a way of making visible how AI technologies discipline and racialise our definitions of ‘the human’ by working through autoethnographic encounters with multiple AI platforms. Here we have the friction and ambivalence that occurs when AI flattens cultural complexity into sanitised universals. This is videographic criticism that does its thinking out loud. Comedy Objects #1: Slapstick Speculation by Noah Teichner Slapstick Speculation shows how videographic methodology can treat archival research not as raw material but as an imaginative, processual space for reanimating history. By blending 1930s comedy shorts, novelty songs, and monologues with speculative fiction, the piece reconstructs Hollywood’s shift to sound through the eyes and labor of comedy workers navigating the shocks of the 1929 Crash. While that is the conceptual background of the piece, for me I can feel how video thinks across media, revealing liveness as an intermedial effect shared by vaudeville, radio, early sound film, the stock ticker, and the choice of font and text-on-screen placement. Co-head of videoessays.org and director of Afterlives This year I was fortunate to be involved in some terrific videographic projects such as the NECSUS issue of video essays on the Locarno Film Festival and a programme of video essays on AI for the Jeu de Paume. Among the exceptional works from these projects, I want to celebrate The Water Diaries: A Letter to Jane by Chiara Grizzaffi, Algorithmic Borders by Silvia Cipelletti, Toute la data du monde by Evelyn Kreutzer, and not exactly a still life by Johannes Binotto. BLKNWS: Terms and Conditions by Khalil Joseph Like watching a videographic supernova, reaching for all the stars. Enjoy utopia whenever you find it.

See Also: Ask Me for Those Unborn Promises that May Seem Unlikely to Happen in the Natural by Donatella Della Ratta and The Void Making Fiction Flow by Melanie Bell & Catherine Grant A quietly radical mobilization of archival materials, creating fascinating associations between a life in film and with films. See Also: Animation in London/ Matchmove in Bangalore by Suryansu Guha Mechanical Kurds by Hito Steyerl AI cinema makes its strongest impact when it collides with its real life context, like a drone missile aimed at someone who programmed it. See Also: Their Eyes by Nicolas Gourault A Tale of Two Desktops: The First Czech Films in Parallel Worlds by Jiří Anger, Veronika Hanáková, and Jiří Žák From the team that seems to be having the most fun making videographic scholarship these days. A toss-up with The Return of the Star Wipe but I went with this in solidarity with non-English-language video essays. See Also: Latencies of the Statistical Image by Roc Albalat Trans Day of Vanishing by Lily Alexandre Most of the choices on my list demonstrate the possibilities of video essays exposed to realities beyond screens. This edu-activist YouTube video champions new possibilities for visibility, while also arguing for the virtues of staying unseen. See Also: Before the Drop by Rosa Wernecke A Life of Its Own: American Psycho by Sara Bezovšek It’s a self-contained rabbit hole. It’s a mock-fan website that holds a funhouse mirror to fan obsession. It’s a compilation of every meme that exists of a certain movie. It’s a critical retelling of that film through those memes. It’s also an installation that turns gallery spaces into sculptural doomscrolls. But… is it a video essay? There is an idea of a video essay. Some kind of abstraction. But there is no real video essay. See Also: You Are Into Mousetrap Youtube by Big Joel Film critic and programmer – Cinemateca Portuguesa, IndieLisboa IFF Here are five films/videos, seen over the last year, that question our relationship with the ‘audiovisual’, with its simultaneous ability to reveal the nature of things and obscure their meaning. Soixante-sept millisecondes by Fleuryfontaine (Galdric Fleury and Antoine Fontaine) A film about trajectories, about bodies and projectiles in motion; it’s a film-denouncement, but it’s also a short treatise on the documental validity of moving images. Green Grey Black Brown by Yuyan Wang Meet Yuyan Wang, today’s most exciting video essayist. Each of her supercuts is a demonstration of the astonishing power of editing and the hypnotic potential of the ‘raccord’. Camera Test (King Cadbury) by Charlie Shackleton This year Charlie Shackleton made his new feature film, the intricate Zodiac Killer Project, but this short film is possibly his best film to date. Film archives and family memories merge with disarming simplicity. Being John Smith by John Smith The culmination of a body of work, the film that gives meaning and offers a retrospective review of a life (and a career). And it does so with the grace and self-deprecating humour that only a master is capable of mastering. 13 Alfinetes by João Pedro Rodrigues, João Rui Guerra da Mata Presented (still in a work-in-progress version) at the end of a retrospective that took place in Lisbon and Madrid, 13 Pins is, to a certain extent, the 8 ½ of João Pedro Rodrigues’s filmography. A film obsessed with circularity which, as a result, revolves simultaneously in a centripetal and centrifugal direction, closing the past and opening up the future. A Vida dos Espelhos by Saguenail and Regina Guimarães Created for the exhibition organised by the museum Casa do Cinema Manoel de Oliveira around the figure of Luis Miguel Cintra, A Vida dos Espelhos is based on a ten-hour interview between the actor and curator António Preto. It revisits the more than 20 films Cintra made with Manoel de Oliveira (plus some with Paulo Rocha), unfolding as an intricate interplay between what is spoken in voice-over and what the film excerpts reveal on screen. A meticulous revisiting of a stage-like oeuvre through the eyes of an actor formed equally by theatre and cinema – a journey of both confirmation and contradiction. Video essayist (as The Lesser Feat) and YouTube researcher who teaches Film & Television Studies at the University of Warwick All my chosen videos were published on YouTube (in some cases also Nebula), and made by non-academics. As a scholar of YouTube video essays, this seems my best chance to highlight a few different creators than some of my academic colleagues. While YouTube video essays can be about virtually any topic, I restrict myself to examples in which creators analyse at least one piece of screen media. Trans Day of Vanishing by Lily Alexandre Thrillingly experimental but accessible, deeply anxious but defiantly poised, this is a fascinating meditation on the politics of trans visibility in the second Trump era. Alexandre’s video probes this subject partly via film analyses (e.g.: We’re All Going to the World’s Fair), but more affectingly through its formal variety: an extreme-widescreen aspect ratio clashes with perversely restricted framings, handheld self-recordings of Alexandre fleeing riot police contrast steely surveillance-camera footage, guerilla street projection and more. All navigate in different ways the political potentials, dangers, and power of the camera’s gaze. My favourite YouTube video essay of the year by some margin; in fact, one of my screen media highlights of 2025, period. When Your Hero Is a Monster by The Leftist Cooks The Leftist Cooks are the Ireland-based married couple Sarah Oeffler and Neilly Farrell, and they make some of the most consistently aesthetically ambitious and intellectually thoughtful work in the field of what used to be called BreadTube (the loose collective of further-Left-than-liberal YouTube video essayists that flourished especially during the previous Trump presidency). Here they wrestle disarmingly honestly with the problem of beloved artists who reveal themselves as undeserving of their fans’ love (in this case, primarily Neil Gaiman), with characteristic humour, earnestness, insight, and creativity. You Are into Mousetrap YouTube by Big Joel Illustrated with charming drawings by another underrated YouTuber, Mothcub, this short work about YouTube viewing habits might be considered more of an animated short story than a video essay. I’d put it differently: like (say) David Foster Wallace’s writing, which can dance between the modes of critical essay and literature, Big Joel here pushes the YouTube analytic-essayistic mode to its most literary and lyrical. Fear of Dark by Jacob Geller This is the latest in Geller’s Fear of… series, which explores the eerie fascination of environments associated with the limits of human sensory experience (it follows Fear of Cold, …of Depths, and …of Big Things Underwater). Drawing on a dizzying multitude of expressive uses of darkness in videogames, films and visual art, Geller’s atmospheric video also embodies its theme through its own photography: evocative experiments with unnervingly low light levels help conjure feelings of dread by testing his camera’s capacity to capture true darkness. The Unforgivable Sin of Ms Rachel by Lindsay Ellis One of the foundational voices of the YouTube video essay returned to the platform this year after a period during which she’s largely been making work for the creator-owned platform Nebula. The result was a classic, thoughtful Ellis breakdown of a cultural controversy, now applied to a weightier topic than usual: the backlash faced by children’s YouTuber Ms Rachel for her forthright support of Gaza. Her decision to publish it on YouTube has allowed the fundraiser Ellis attached to the video to raise over $800,000 for The Palestinian Children’s Relief Fund. Film critic The Body Hysteric by Cristina Álvarez López This, the best video essay of the year, was rejected by the Marienbad Festival selection committee. Their – and their audience’s – loss. Male Gazing by David Verdeure A remarkable, thoroughgoing and very intricate treatment of a classic film, Hitchcock’s Rear Window. See and hear things you never knew were there! Nebulous Encounters by Catherine Grant Two mighty scenes in fog, from Murnau’s Sunrise and Amenábar’s The Others. Arranged simply but eloquently across two screens. All cinema is here. Queer performance-based media artist, Montreal My picks reflect what excited me about video essay making this year and are by no means exhaustive. I look forward to watching works that others will share on this list that I don’t know. Trans Day of Vanishing by Lily Alexandre A thorough 48-minute rumination about the stakes of trans visibility for trans people, this longform work by YouTube essayist Lily Alexandre was warmly received when I saw it on the big screen at Montreal’s Exposures, Canada’s only trans film festival. At the centre of this piece is a question about trans visibility and whom it is for. Alexandre dives in deeply to offer insightful critique of trans film and media objects complemented and complicated by protest footage, surveillance, and nighttime monologues staged in quiet outdoor locations, all invoking concerns about public spaces, safety, and risk. Do yourself a favour: close your open tabs and apps, go full-screen, and give this remarkable work your full attention. See Under: Orient by Colleen Laird What an incredible video essay! Simply one of Colleen Laird’s best, See Under: Orient was made as part of One Hundred Movies Walk into a Bar… a summer 2025 collaborative videographic workshop organised by Ariel Avissar and Laird that responded to The 100 Best Movies of the 21st Century list published by The New York Times. Laird structures her video essay around definitions of ‘orient’ (with reference to Ariel Avissar’s TV Dictionary format) and explodes our screen and speakers with a captivating soundtrack, stunning multiscreens (the vertical slices in the middle of the piece are particularly enthralling), heady Google Map zooms, and a brilliant use of text that selects and directs us to just how embedded Orientalist frameworks and biases are in film culture. Making Fiction Flow by Melanie Bell & Catherine Grant I learn so much from Catherine Grant every time I watch her work, and this piece co-created with film historian Melanie Bell about film continuity and the life and work of script supervisor Penny Eyles is no exception. A masterclass in video essay making, this video essay uses an intricate layout reminiscent of a video editing interface where we are challenged to decode Grant’s arrangement of scenes and sources as they play out, exemplifying Grant’s renowned engagement with material thinking. Centred around Sally Potter’s Orlando, Grant expertly takes us through the unseen labour of Eyles through archive, documentary, and extracted scenes from British films produced between 1943 and 2012. What a treat! (dis)Orientating Horror: Feeling Queerly by Lucy Fife Donaldson This award-winning video essay (Marienbad Film Festival, 2025) is a pleasure to watch. Fife Donaldson mirrors, flips, and layers landscape shots from horror films that fill the frame with a disorienting sense of foreboding made eerie and uncanny through repetition of sound and image. Fully interrogating Sara Ahmed’s work on queer orientation from her book Queer Phenomenology, Fife Donaldson artfully uses text on screen with a delicious colour palette that exemplifies its content. Full disclosure: this video essay appears in a special issue of Monstrum entitled Queer/ing Horror: Video Essays at the Intersection of Horror and Queerness, which I edited. I Can Hear Someone Coming by Alison Peirse Alison Pierse’s videographic work is always so meticulous, and this playful, provocative, joyful, queer video essay is no exception. She invites us to imagine if all women in 1930s horror were queer and proceeds to deliver this fantasy of their sexual arousal. Circular cut-outs act like peepholes into scenes that focus our attention onto key characters and their (now) queer actions. With scalpel-like precision, she extracts individual words, sentences, gasps, and exclamations to construct sexy sound bites of female desire in the body of the piece. Lavender text spells out this dialogue over lush vintage wallpaper. Such a delight! Full disclosure: this video essay also appears in a special issue of Monstrum entitled Queer/ing Horror: Video Essays at the Intersection of Horror and Queerness, which I edited. Backlot Connections by John Gibbs With an Easter egg tucked behind every turn, this video essay links an array of (mainly) 1950s films through their shared use of the Universal backlot, connecting seemingly disparate characters, scenarios, and plots to ultimately reveal their similarities. Gibbs unobtrusively uses an onscreen subtitle track to narrate his observations and guide us through the same American town square again and again. He maps fictional spaces onto real, reused set pieces that live just beyond the Los Angeles River, weaving together stories that happened across fictions and temporalities to invite us into this endlessly recycled town. Meet Part | Mothers Daughters by Viktoria Paranyuk Moments of longing, intimacy, trauma, and loss are connected in this moving video essay by Viktoria Paranyuk. She puts Chantal Akerman’s Meetings with Anna in onscreen conversation with Lana Gogoberidze’s Some Interviews on Personal Matters, foregrounding the filmmakers’ personal lives, histories, and relationships with their mothers and how this has shaped their films. Paranyuk uses grids and feminist diptychs to engage both films and their makers, what Paranyuk calls “empathetic engagement” with incredible success. Video essayist (as kikikrazed) and community manager for The Essay Library For my selections, I chose to highlight videos that inspired me as both a creator and viewer of video essays. A Video About Everything Except This Monument Hidden in the Bushes by Dime Store Adventures Dime Store Adventures is, to me, the best storyteller on YouTube right now. This video sets out to document the process of researching a monument in Rhode Island, but it evolves several times. I appreciate how much he shares about his thought process as both a researcher and video creator. Each new discovery makes the video better because he welcomes them instead of trying to bend his sources to fit a certain conclusion. There’s a reveal at the 19 minute mark that made me pause the video and immediately save it to my list for this poll. SE7EN & How 35mm Scans Lie to You by WatchingtheAerial I love how WatchingtheAerial often includes an activity related to the topic of each video essay. In this case, for a video about fan-made film scans and remasters, he makes some scans of his own to get a personal look at the process. This essay does a great job of explaining technical information in a clear and concise way. He provides a nuanced take on the ongoing debate surrounding the accuracy of different scans and releases, with a fun twist at the end. The Real Story Behind the Backrooms by Kendra Gaylord There’s no shortage of online discussion about the Backrooms, but Kendra Gaylord still manages to find something new to say. It’s a surprisingly funny exploration of the real building behind the famous Backrooms photo, packed with tons of information about the architectural developments that have occurred over the room’s lifetime. Every time I rewatch this video I learn something new thanks to Kendra’s genuine interest in digging up niche information and sharing it with the world. With the release of the upcoming A24 film The Backrooms, the concept is evolving from a collaborative storytelling exercise to a profitable venture. The Backrooms are about to change forever, so I appreciate how Kendra takes the opportunity to highlight the real building and memories that started it all. Why You Should WANT To Cite Your Sources by Dime Store Adventures I’m mentioning Dime Store Adventures again because I think this video does a great job of highlighting what’s wrong with the way many people talk about plagiarism on YouTube. He argues that many creators cite their sources primarily to avoid being accused of plagiarism (a reoccurring scandal on the platform) instead of recognising the actual benefit that good citation practices have. This video should be required viewing for anyone incorporating research in their videos. You are a better writer than AI. (Yes, you.) by josh (with parentheses) “Humans call, and humans answer.” This essay itself is endlessly inspiring, but what I find especially motivating is the response it received. In the comments section I noticed that it was many viewers’ first introduction to the world of desktop documentaries – and they were so excited to discover the format! If you spend a lot of time releasing videos on YouTube, you start to feel weighed down by the pressure to ‘play it safe’ or risk losing favour in the eyes of the indecipherable algorithm. The response to this video essay proves that YouTube audiences have an appetite for more creativity and experimentation on the platform. Co-editor and co-founder, [in]Transition This list will largely consist of works published in [in]Transition given how much time and bandwidth viewing and reviewing submissions takes. Needless to say, I’m excited to see the selections of my colleagues and peers that will introduce me to pieces I missed given that blindspot. On Listening by Pavitra Sundar I had always imagined that it would be difficult to make a video essay analysing how sound functions in film given the medium’s skew towards visual information. Pavitra Sundar’s video On Listening challenged my own lack of imagination with its poetic exploration. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková There’s a running concern I tend to have about our field – that the texts videographic critics tend to privilege are canonical works by esteemed auteurs (I’m guilty of it too). In this context, Anger and Hanáková’s insightful exploration of the star wipe reminds us that serious analysis can account for the derided as well… sometimes even playfully. Crochet Is Sick! by Alison Peirse Alison Peirse showcases such an intuitive sense of rhythm and clip selection in her supercuts that it sometimes takes me multiple screenings to fully appreciate the argument they present because I’m so transfixed by their aesthetics. Crochet Is Sick!, like her previous work Knit One, Stab Two, continues her exploration of gender and the horror genre, but she finds significant deviations and fresh terrain here. Plus I always end up with a list of more horror flicks to check out by the end of her pieces, which is always a win. Film teacher and researcher at Escola das Artes in Católica University (O Porto); film programmer; film critic at À pala de Walsh website Daria’s Night Flowers by Maryam Tafakory Maryam Tafakory’s essayistic cinema germinates from observation, a meticulous look at the past of her art, detecting images that remain to be made, imagined. However, it would be simpler to fill these gaps with parallel fictions. This is not her method: counter-imagination is filmed on the back of these very painful images, as if inviting the viewer to turn the past of Iranian cinema inside out and see new possibilities. In Daria’s Night Flowers, Tafakory ‘demands’ the images of oppressed and desperate women from post-revolution Iranian cinema to tell us about the possibility of an impossible queer love, and in this colourful, blossoming gesture, we are simultaneously seeing the prison bars and the freedom that the palimpsest points to. Kelly Reichardt’s Bestiario by Celia Sainz Celia Sainz is interested in exploring the notion of videographic ecocriticism, not only as thematic exploration but as an ontological gesture. Is the critical operation that acts directly on the structure of a film a way of revealing the fragility of the boundaries that insist on dividing things? Kelly Reichardt’s Bestiary is a three-part essay that operates this fragmentation within the American director’s body of work, but does so from a directional logic. To where do our eyes turn to? In the first segment, Birds Eye Views, we look up, where the life of birds challenges us in movement and sound. In the last segment, Ground Dog Day, we remain horizontal, close to the ground, in this communion on soil between humans (other beings) and dogs. In the middle of this gesture, No(Hu)Man’s Land, Sainz positions humans among other existences, revealing themselves among shots of segmented bodies that are becoming across the technological, the synthetic and the biological. In this case, videographic ecocriticism is a way to pierce through and connect the unconnected. Om Shanti Omnibus by International Video Essay Research Network (IVERN) In video essays, there is a ‘profane’ gesture towards the uniqueness and integrity of the work. Perhaps this premise makes videographic criticism an appropriate method for thinking about the decentering of authorial unity and the collaborative approach. Twelve members of the International Video Essay Research Network (IVERN) divided up a film they were unfamiliar with – Om Shanti Om (Farah Khan, 2007) – and, working on a specific segment, they had to obey specific parameters. The use of text on screen, voiceover, epigraph, multiscreen, superimposition, music/sound only from film, music/sound from external source, self-filmed footage (including desktop), footage from another source, repetition, unusual transitions and speed. The end result is fascinating: a cadavre exquis that is not just a compilation but a suggestion for mapping pedagogical possibilities in the teaching and practice of audiovisual essayism. The dissemination of perspectives on Khan’s film and the multiplication of digital impressions placed over the original give this exercise a true sense of decentralised criticism, of perspectives signed simultaneously from places of proximity, distance and collaboration. Hands Off, Eyes On by Donatella Della Ratta, R. Alessandro Turchioe, and Sofia Busquets Hands Off, Eyes On, by Donatella Della Ratta, R. Alessandro Turchioe and Sofia Busquets, is an intelligent video essay that exposes the tensions inherent in activism, in the distinction between the eye and the hand. Between visibility with transformative potential and the hypothetical limitations of that hand and the (im)possibility of art to have an immediately transformative impact. Hands Off, Eyes On takes a critical look at media, its reception, and the visibility market of festivals. Behind the screens, in their shadows, the films and words printed on the wall continue (contradict) the privileged space of cinema. Abbas Kiarostami: A Transversal Filmography by Cristian Tormo Cristian Tormo’s, Abbas Kiarostami: A Transversal Filmography brilliantly shows how a filmmaker can advance in his themes from film to film. The work expands, becomes more complex, branches out. The work grows up, like the characters in these films. Kiarostami is a key author for understanding the relationship between cinema and growing up, especially in the transition from childhood to adolescence. This video essay shows how, although the theme remains the same, the strategies for filming the problems of growing up change as the dilemmas transform and the world expands. Fading Echoes: Remembering and Forgetting through Videotapes by Vladimir Rosas-Salazar Nothing escapes deterioration. At the same time, everyone tries to resist it. Vladimir Rosas-Salazar uses home videos that his family recorded in the 1990s and 2000s in this video essay. Personal videos promised to build an archive as resistance to the loss of organic memory. Like with film. And as will probably happen with digital data. Rosas-Salazar uses the marks of the media, of its decay, its palimpsest, not only to suggest this fragility to us, but to reflect on the fallibility of memory. The imperfection of the media is perhaps the best match for the imperfection of memory: both recover, create and slowly fade away. The Beginning Is the End Is the Beginning by João Araújo A brief editing exercise: hypnotic, simple, about to be lost. Of all the techniques that audiovisual essays can use, editing, as the beginning of a conversation with cinema, retains a mysterious form. In Araújo’s The Beginning Is the End Is the Beginning, we glide through the fragility of the end of something that always restarts. The moving image of cinema symbolises this life, this fluidity, which lies between the elements, between the liquid and the weight of the fruit. In the midst of our gaze, everything falls, gravity is complete. But soon, everything rises again. It is the brilliance of cinema, which links causes, that makes death impermanent. As Marcus Aurelius wrote: “All things are implicated in one another and in sympathy with each other. This event is the consequence of some other one. Things push and pull on each other, and breathe together, and are one.” YouTube-based video essayist Why Did UK Crisp Packets Swap Colours? by Chris Spargo While many people attribute Spargo’s meteoric rise in 2025 to the absence of household name Tom Scott, I think that’s doing him a bit of a disservice. He’s his own creator, in both personality and subject matter. Answering the question that you’ve always wondered, but been too afraid to ask, Why Did UK Crisp Packets Swap Colours? weaves a five-minute tale of corporate battles and tragedy, while also overlapping with the “Maths is blue instead of yellow” niche. There really is something for everyone here. Wacky History of Computer Scrabble by Junferno It’s easy to get distracted by Junferno from the Junferno YouTube Channel’s fast paced editing and deadpan humour without realising that you’re actually learning University-level Computer Science. Wacky History of Computer Scrabble is a dense dive into something that, on the surface, should be quite simple. It’s Scrabble, after all — you’ve played Scrabble, right? Yet, in between quips and jokes that you can only make sense of five seconds after he’s told them, you’ll learn that computers are really weird and Scrabble is really complicated and they also called one of the models for playing a word a “dawg”. That’s pretty funny. Games About Concrete by Puddle If we subscribe to the popular 2007 animated film Ratatouille’s idea of “a great chef can come from anywhere”, then Puddle’s Games About Concrete is proof that it can apply to the world of Video Essays as well. Sitting at a YouTube subscriber count of double digits, Puddle’s video is a both bleak and uplifting dive into a series of games about concrete and the sublime, harrowing, fantastical feelings they evoke. While many creators leave no stone unturned in their coverage, Puddle is not afraid to let the video breathe and to let the games speak for themselves, leaving the interpretation up to the viewer. PhD student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison Trans Day of Vanishing by Lily Alexandre Lily Alexandre’s work has maintained a reliable spot on my list since 2023, and this year was no different. Trans Day of Vanishing is a chilling (literally, in some shots), haunting, incisive reflection on contemporary trans visibility, and it’s one of her best videos to date. You Are into Mousetrap YouTube by Big Joel Written and delivered by Big Joel and animated delightfully by Mothcub, this video isn’t really about mousetraps or YouTube, but it’s also about both? Or possibly neither. Either way, I found it terrifying and wonderful. The Unforgivable Sin of Ms Rachel by Lindsay Ellis I suspect that I won’t be the only person to put this rare ‘Lindsay Ellis returns to YouTube’ video on my list, so I won’t belabor the point with a woefully incomplete description or justification. This video made me laugh, and cry, and cry, and cry, and it is worth watching again. Academic filmmaker and Associate Professor of film and media at Aarhus University My impression is that the scholarly video essay in 2026 has achieved something like self-assurance. Perhaps institutional recognition of video essay practice has become more established; certainly, some of the innovations of the past 15 years have been integrated and even somewhat routinised. Catherine Grant’s influence seems to me pervasive, particularly the example of her epigraphic work and deployment of soft montage. Grant’s own videos made with collaborators this year – Pausas/Pauses with Rachel Randall, and Making Fiction Flow with Melanie Bell – and the response she made for a collection of video essays edited by Joel Burges and Allison Cooper (ASAP Review, December 2024), are themselves magisterial consolidation of the rhetoric Grant has evolved over a decade and a half. I would place such works in a strand of videographic criticism that suggests the form is uniquely equipped for the reflexive activation of the archive, a strand that stretches from videos like Between Magic and Realism from Kathleen Loock’s Hollywood Memories project, through John Gibbs’ Backlot Connections, to Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková’s The Return of the Star Wipe and Mathias Bonde Korsgaard’s The History of Music Video in 169 Seconds. The ambition of such work also begins to suggest the capacity of videographic criticism to devote sustained attention to themes and phenomena. The two volumes published so far in the Lever Press videographic book series – Jason Mittell on Breaking Bad and Gregory Brophy and Shawn Malley on contemporary science fiction – are the standouts here, of course. (Interestingly, both programmatically employ a range of videographic modes, suggesting that videographic criticism per se is as core a concern as the declared topics.) Series like Johannes Binotto’s Gestures of Thought (among them the uncanny Swallow) and Alison Peirse’s supercut treatments of horror cinema (for example, Crochet Is Sick!) also prove the cumulative power of analysis across multiple videos. Conversely, Christian Keathley’s teasing and complex one-hour Cinephilia and History is a single but monograph-equivalent video essay that demonstrates the intellectual sophistication of which videographic criticism is capable. It also represents an alternative mode of videographic work that foregrounds the body of the maker, albeit in a very different register from that of Dayna McLeod, the preeminent practitioner in this ‘somatic’ mode (see Potbelly). McLeod refers to herself as a ‘performance artist’; I think we need the term ‘performance academic’ to capture the distinctiveness of some of the work being produced. I mention all these essayists and strands they represent because the richness and quantity of work in the field makes choosing ever harder for the purpose of this poll. My ‘official’ selection below expresses my sense of the self-assurance and consolidation in scholarly videographic criticism mentioned above. But it also appreciates the continued experimentation with the video essay form that, I’m glad to say, frustrates the synthesising impulse motivating this introductory paragraph. Contemptuous Chess: A Moving Poem by Drew Morton Contemptuous Chess is a contribution to Evelyn Kreutzer’s Moving Poems project, in which makers are invited to pair “a single poem or multiple poems […] with a single or multiple moving-image media text(s) […]”. Morton puts three texts into dialogue: Alberto Moravia’s novel Il disprezzo (Contempt, 1954), about a playwright who reluctantly adapts The Odyssey for the screen, Godard’s film adaptation of that novel, Le Mépris (Contempt, 1963), and Rosario Castellanos’s poem Chess (1972). The result is a masterclass in pacing, on-screen text, and the orchestration of voices, other sound and music. With readings of Castellanos’s poem in four languages, it applies the lessons of Barbara Zecchi’s thinking on the ‘accented video essay’ and presents adaptation itself as an accented practice. Preliminary Notes for Thinking About a Place by Catalina Segú I thought Joel Burges and Allison Cooper’s cluster of video essays entitled The Personal Mediascape in the Age of Videographic Heterotopias was extremely well conceived and produced (full disclosure: I was invited – and delighted – to compose a video response). Among the uniformly superb videos in the collection, I think I have watched most often Catalina Segú’s Preliminary Notes for Thinking About a Place, which deals with the personal and cultural legacies of the Chilean dictatorship. This formally and thematically ambitious video essay reveals new connections with each viewing, and I use it regularly now in class to show how complexity and ambivalence can be managed and enacted as videographic thought. The ParAIax View by Ariel Avissar I think Ariel Avissar won’t mind if I describe The ParAlax View as the ugliest video essay of 2025. It’s also one of the year’s most intellectually intriguing. The video is a shot-for-shot AI remake of the ‘brainwashing montage’ from Alan J. Pakula’s The Parallax View (1974) in which the original images are replaced by slop approximations generated by Picsart, themselves based on prompts elicited from ChatGPT. Avissar also composes the creator statement in iterative and avowed collaboration with ChatGPT, and includes interpolations from an unnamed peer reviewer. The combination of video essay and unstably authored text self-consciously takes forward videographic criticism as a distributed and cyborg scholarly practice. Sound Stack, Soundwalk, Southworth by Cormac Donnelly I may be cheating by nominating Cormac Donnelly’s Sound Stack, Soundwalk, Southworth. This is not a single video essay but a portfolio of three videos containing a video analysis of a soundscape in Zodiac (David Fincher, 2007), a methodological tutorial on imaging techniques borrowed from Kevin Ferguson, and the recording of a soundwalk Donnelly took through Boston, for a total of 134 minutes. As with Ariel Avissar’s video and statement, Donnelly’s portfolio insists on videographic scholarship as a distributed and compound practice, and argues against conceptions of the video essay as an autonomous or self-contained form. I’m delighted to see Donnelly picking up the idea of ‘luxury scholarship’, in which making and method are indulged for their own sake. At the same time, Donnelly’s challenge to the ‘visual prejudice’ in film studies salutarily reprises a strand of important work by the great Liz Greene, and resonates with recent work on sound by scholar-makers like Pavitra Sundar (On Listening) and Annalisa Pellino (the forthcoming Becoming-Voice). Object Oriented Breaking Bad by Jason Mittell I take advantage of the publication in late 2024 of Jason Mittell’s videographic book, The Chemistry of Character in Breaking Bad, to nominate a video essay that has circulated for some years. I think Object Oriented Breaking Bad is a key work in the field. It shows how deformative methods can analytically grasp aspects of long-form texts hidden in plain sight, surfacing textures of world-building and the more-than-human. It suggests the potential for videographic practice to allow non-human entities to ‘speak’ in what we can imagine with Bruno Latour as a ‘Parliament of Things’ – a forum in which objects and ecologies find political representation alongside citizens and societies. An Accented Video Way of Thinking: Becoming videoessay by Barbara Zecchi Drawing on thinkers like Deleuze and Hamid Naficy, and on theories of the accent as a mode of thought rather than just speech, Barbara Zecchi’s meta-video contrasts the ‘videoessay’ (she insists on the single word), as an ‘accented’ form of criticism, with traditional, purportedly ‘accent-less’ scholarship. This is playful but challenging work: I may even have overheard Prof. Zecchi suggest that, on rewatching the videoessay, she found she couldn’t quite follow it, despite having made it herself. This is as it should be. Please don’t mention this to Prof. Zecchi, but I prefer this mode in her work to the more crowd-pleasing and easily legible achievement of a video like The Rhythms of Rage. The work we do should exceed and elude us. ‘Predictable Unpredictability’– Dynamic Embodied Patterns in Miklós Jancsó’s Film Style by Miklós Kiss and Maarten Coëgnarts Miklós Kiss and Maarten Coëgnarts would certainly disagree with what I have just written. Miklós Kiss has been resolute in arguing the distinction between videographic research method and communication mode, and has insisted on the need to be ‘clear’ in scholarly video essays. Accordingly, Predictable Unpredictability is exemplary in its explanatory clarity. Kiss and Coëgnarts show how complex frame and figure movement in Miklós Jancsó, hard to grasp by traditional analytical means, can be captured and analysed by merging animated diagrams and film extracts. In working audiovisually to offer a precise account of an aspect of Jancsó’s style, Kiss and Coëgnarts have expanded the rhetoric and capacities of videographic criticism. Video essayists and political activists We try to avoid hierarchies so this exercise was a challenge. We picked essays which each exemplified a different aspect of the artform. Doubtlessly, there are other equally beautiful essays from this year, but these are the ones that stuck with us. The Alt-Right Playbook: The South Bank of the Rubicon by Innuendo Studios For years now, Innuendo Studios has put out videos starting with a hypothetical, “Say, for the sake of argument”. This video, apparently the last in the series, does not start that way. Instead it starts with gentle sound design, and an unexpected introduction. This essay is a plea, and it will be a time capsule. It asks the audience to take stock in the moment they’re in, as they watch a dark history unfold. It makes salient the emotional turmoil of experiencing politics, with an eerily gentle tone. Fascists Will Waste Your Time. by Thought Slime Thought Slime uses comedy to be very clear, and uses clarity to be shatteringly funny. As with most of their videos, the tone is intentionally unpretentious. Thought Slime puts forth an argument about the best way to speak to unapologetic fascists, which is not to speak to them at all. Behind her humour is unimpeachable logic, and Mildred’s persona is thoroughly enjoyable company, even with what should be a grim topic. DIY HRT: Everything I Can Legally Tell You by Lily Alexandre This video is praxis; and not in some fuzzy sense in which art inspires revolutions, but in the simple and straightforward sense that the work itself will tangibly help people. We would not be surprised to see other works from Lily on this list, and comparatively this work may seem somewhat unassuming. But it is the work we have forwarded to people who are in desperate positions, having to manage their own healthcare. There is real bravery in using a platform like YouTube to spread information to marginalised people, and Lily does so with her usual mastery of the medium. Brat and the Culture of Addiction by Alexander Avila An Alexander Avila video sometimes feels like taking an interesting philosophy class, complete with pop culture references, swish lighting, perfect music and sprinkles of queer innuendo. This video in particular showcases Alex’s ability to compose a narrative with a dizzying array of elements. He takes real risks. At one point in his piece, Alex breaks all the rules of YouTube and filmmaking and addresses the audience directly in a pointed staring contest. Not just anticipating the audience’s discomfort, but triggering it intentionally, watching you with folded arms as time passes. Much of the video feels uncomfortable, and yet it’s a work we’ve watched more than once. For such a demonstration of virtuosity it also has such heart. The ‘War’ in Gaza Is Not Really Taking Place by chriswaves Chriswaves is the mercurial personification of internet culture; he has emerged as one of the most unique and insightful voices covering the intersection of technology, alienation, and capitalist exploitation. His work is slick, catchy, and meticulously edited. In this essay, he applies Jean Baudrillard’s and Achille Mbembe’s work to the conflict in Gaza, and highlights the throughline from small acts of capitalistic exploitation to terrifying state violence. It’s haunting without being voyeuristic, academic while still feeling urgent. And most importantly, it somehow ends on a plea for hope. Chris’s work is both innovative and familiar, a reminder of what is uniquely good about this genre. Video essayist, community manager for the Essay Library, Yu-Gi-Oh player Being a manager for the Essay Library, a Discord server for up-and-coming video essayists, I tend to come into contact with a lot of video essays from… up-and-coming video essayists. It’s wonderful to see the payoff for videos when I’ve seen firsthand the amount of work that has gone into them, and the source of various artistic choices taken in their creation. My submissions include some highlights of those from this year. You are a better writer than AI. (Yes, you.) by josh (with parentheses) Rarely do you come across a video that makes you feel the kind of joy you get from just being a human. This video from Josh showcases this joy in one of its most basic forms: communication. He refutes the value of AI writing from the idea that the purpose of writing is to meet with another person, and reflects the personal side of this issue by drawing upon his experiences with his friends and as an English professor to back up his points. This essay is both deeply intimate and extremely relevant to an important issue impacting our cultural landscape. Storytime Animation Doesn’t Feel Relatable Anymore by comma splice This first video from comma splice explores the transformation of the YouTube genre of storytime animation. These videos usually reflect on one’s lived experience – they tend to change quite a bit in style and substance as their creators grow from hobbyists to the owners of small production companies. Though comma splice’s essay functions as a critique, it comes from a place of love for the genre, and it can easily be seen in their self-made avatar which meshes wonderfully with the style of the videos they critique. I hope to see more of their work in the future. Change-Makers: Opposing Fascism In Daily Life by Afterthoughts This is one of a couple of videos in a series by Afterthoughts, which seeks to showcase actionable goals people strive for when trying to resist the current political landscape. A common critique of leftist video essays is that while they often seek to inform people of issues in society, they don’t often provide a guide for solving the problem. Change-Makers has this missing information in spades, tackling tactics like civil disobedience or protesting often through the lens of three different archetypes of activist that they define. This information is something that I think many people sorely need at the moment, and Afterthoughts is doing a fantastic job at presenting it! How to Reduce Salt by Core-A GamingMy favourite aspect of Core-A Gaming is that while his videos are incredibly applicable to his chosen subject of fighting games, they usually extend to the general mindset approaching competition. In this video, he examines techniques used in cognitive behavioral therapy to create a healthier mindset towards approaching competition, which is an issue that many people struggle with from my own experience. I love the way he incorporates interviews he conducts with top players from various games to back up his points, easily bridging the gap from theoretical to practical. Professor of Film Studies, University of Leeds Videographic criticism is feeling its archival fantasy in 2025. Check out Ellen Nolan’s The Nita Harvey Archive for Screenworks, Amanda Doxtater’s Epitaph for Sonja 1: Body/Archive/Movement in ASAP-Review, Viktoria Paranyuk’s Meet Part | Mothers Daughters in Apparatus, and the wonderful Movie dossier Audiovisual Approaches and the Archive. I remain, as ever, obsessed with archives, film history, and feelings. This (magnificent) obsession is evidenced with great beauty and clarity in the work I have selected: Zodiac Killer Project by Charlie Shackleton when the archive denies your desires AGENCIA by May Santiago when the archive cannot hold you Okay Keskidee! Let Me See Inside by Rhea Storr when film builds new archives They’re Just Hands! by Dayna McLeod when film is reimagined as an archive of love Video essayist You are a better writer than AI. (Yes, you.) by josh (with parentheses) There are many videos dissecting the numerous problems with AI but none have inspired me to be a better human and friend like this thoughtful exploration of communication and art. be your own algorithm by pagemelt A rare criticism of algorithms that keeps its critique aimed where it belongs while being a love letter to humanity and art in ways that are often dismissed in other critiques of our online spaces controlled by corporations. I Saw the TV Glow: CRT Memories and Fuzzy Genders by AdequateEmily A masterful analysis that weaves in the personal from herself and other trans people to poignantly touch on why this film had such an impact for many of us, myself included. WARFRAME 1999 is Absurdly Punk Rock by SocraTetris I found myself loving a game that I knew nearly nothing about going in. A thoughtful examination of what a piece of art has to say when we consider its cultural context in a moment in time with an emphatically punk rock conclusion. What I Learned Photographing NPCs in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth by SolidArf A beautiful exploration of the little details in massive AAA games through a lens of his love of photography which brings appreciation to elements of the art form often overlooked. How Galileo Broke the Scientific Method by Dr Fatima An ideological breakdown of how science itself is often discussed and perceived gives us much to think about how we go about acquiring knowledge. Dr Fatima’s end of video discussions are also a welcome addition that not only build on her points but something we rarely see on YouTube. Sinners and the Death of Black Art by F.D. Signifier Manages to take a beloved piece of media and uses it to interrogate a double consciousness that exists when creating media within systems that are antagonistic to those making the media. Video essayist on YouTube Regrettably, this selection is limited to the YouTube video essay sphere, as I’m not familiar enough with the wider landscape to be much use beyond it. That being said, I’m very happy to share some of the great video work I’ve been fortunate enough to see on that platform this year! We’ve forgotten how to forget. by josh (with parentheses) This one flew way under the radar. Josh’s piece goes down an elegantly presented and deeply compelling rabbit hole, starting with a few confusing frames of 1995’s A Goofy Movie, moving through questions of medium, cartography, and even Disney lore, ending on a recognition of what we’ve lost as online viewers – the ability “to love a thing and let it go”. Scratch the surface, and many of our present moment’s distressing realities feel like knock-on effects of this principle, of the way the internet lets any discussion carry on, intensify, and ferment forever. The alt-right wouldn’t have formed if they’d had to GamerGate in person. There’d be no basilisks or longtermism addling the minds in charge of our economies had LessWrong been a coffee shop. This essay isn’t about either of those things – it’s about a weird map in A Goofy Movie! – but our journey down that rabbit hole is very much situated in the concerns of 2025. You Are into Mousetrap YouTube by Big Joel Is this even a video essay? Is it a visual poem, instead? What’s the difference? I’m not sure. Whatever this is, Big Joel has produced an obliquely evocative video that examines cruelty, interpersonal boundaries, the intimacy of viewing, the way every surface on a platform like YouTube is, in some way, a slippery slope. This one rewards repeat viewings, and is gorgeously animated by mothcub. Fantasies of Nuremberg by Jacob Geller How do you make video essays while the world is falling apart? It’s a question many prominent creators in this space have wrestled with in recent times. Some answers have been better than others. From a formal perspective, Fantasies of Nuremberg is a more straightforward essay than many of Geller’s, except when it’s not. It takes the viewer along in a journey from despair, to confusion, to rage, and back again. Revenge is too much, and not enough. Justice is elusive. This is a knotty essay. The knots remain largely intact at its end, but handling them together for 40 or so minutes does result in a sort of affirmation. The Ten Traits of Slop Content by Ro Ramdin This is, as one YouTube commenter puts it, “A very thorough thesis on stuff that kinda evades thoroughness.” Slop is one of those terms that came out of nowhere and shot straight into the dominant vocabulary of the internet. For the past year or so, it’s been very hard to talk online about art or content without having to contend with this word in some way. Many of us have attempted to define what people are trying to convey with the term, and most of us have failed. Not Ro Ramdin. By avoiding direct definition and instead lasering in on the ways we talk about slop, the voices leading that conversation, and the social, cultural and technological contexts we’re doing slop ‘discourse’ within, Ramdin takes us right to its heart. It’s an uneasy, sickly sweet journey. Are Americans Irish? by The Leftist Cooks There are very few essayists I’ll drop whatever I’m doing to catch up on. The Leftist Cooks are among that number, and this essay is a great example of why. Honestly, all their essays are – I could have picked any of their releases from the past 12 months here. Neilly and Sarah are masters of the long-form video essay. It’s not easy to dive as deep into a question as the pair do here while keeping that exploration fresh, thought-provoking, and authentic (trust me, I’ve tried). Are Americans Irish? does all this and more, zooming through history, film, politics, philosophy, and personal experience to end up interrogating the very idea of identity. Head of Film Programming & Distribution, Eye Filmmuseum Dracula by Radu Jude Outrageous essay film on AI, the bloodsucker of our times. Daria’s Night Flowers by Maryam Tafakory Pretty sure I picked a film by Maryam Tafakory every time I participated in this poll. Masterful as always. Remembering Otherwise by belit sağ A performative reading in the cinema inviting the audience to analyse the same few seconds of footage in different ways, based on a broader project on a 1978 labour strike in Veghel, the Netherlands, led by Turkish migrant women. happiness by Fırat Yücel Ancestral Visions of the Future by Lemohang Jeremiah Mosese Their Eyes by Nicolas Gourault BLKNWS: Terms & Conditions by Kahlil Joseph Audiovisual PhD student and Film & TV Placement Coordinator at the University of Birmingham In no particular order, these all made it onto a handy notepad this year, under the heading ’video essays to watch again’. Enjoy! Backlot Connections by John Gibbs As an actor plays different parts, so the backlot portrays different places, yet fundamentally remains itself. A fascinating study of how seemingly separate narratives and characters’ lives converge on and around the Universal Backlot. Arkiv Avis Mor (Archive Newspaper Mother) by Marie Hallager Andersen I found this utterly captivating and original. Marie Hallager Andersen weaves together a whale, old newspaper, home videos, dance performances, projection, questions about archives and bodies, and so much more. Beautiful storytelling that ruminates on motherhood, memory and movement. The Return of the Star Wipe by Jiří Anger and Veronika Hanáková Meticulously researched, so fun to watch and a perfectly realised retro aesthetic throughout that is anything but gimmicky in its execution. <applause> Lost in Grand Central by Joel Blackledge Clever interplay of text and image showcases the incongruity between Hollywood superstars and a British city widely denigrated for its looks, as well as the confusion many have experienced in and around Birmingham New Street Station and Grand Central shopping centre. I wish I’d made this! Mapping Roma by Jessica Wax-Edwards An embodied exploration into the filming locations of Roma which uses superimposition to great effect, highlighting the complexities of representing ‘real’ places on screen, both past and present, and how film location tourists may experience them. Filler Words by Ian Garwood Entertaining and subtly provocative, this certainly gave me ‘pause for thought’. Crochet Is Sick! by Alison Peirse So well crafted (excuse the pun), I can’t look at crocheted blankets or shawls in any screen context now without wondering what impending horrors may await. Building on her previous video essay ‘Knit One, Stab Two’ – though this also works strongly as a standalone piece – Alison Peirse champions the crucial work of the Art Department and Wardrobe. Freelance critic, former associate editor for documentary at Hyperallergic Henry Fonda for President by Alexander Horwath The best theatrically released essay film I’ve seen this year. Henry Fonda, it turns out, works very well as both a metonym and a contrast with America and its history. Everyone Is Cheating at Chess (Allegedly) by Sarah Z Extremely fun and funny video about people going to extremes to cheat, which also is a useful look at how changing technology and social mores have caused the storied strategy game’s meta, social role, and psychogeographic environment to evolve. Why Movies Just Don’t Feel ‘Real’ Anymore by Like Stories of Old There’s been a lot of discourse about digital sheen and changing production models and how it’s affected cinema aesthetics. This, more than any other video or single article, works perfectly as a succinct way to explain to those who might not get it just what we’re talking about. The Wizard of Oz at Sphere Is Nightmare Fuel by Be Kind Rewind ChatGPT Made Me Delusional by Eddy Burback Disney’s Living Characters: A Broken Promise by Defunctland Video essayist and PhD How to Spot a Bad Critic by Accented Cinema The rise of independent creators on online platforms like YouTube has, for all its benefits, also led to a collapse in quality control. Virtually anyone can upload a video of insubstantial analysis or bad-faith criticism and call it a video essay. How to Spot a Bad Critic offers a useful framework for viewers to recognise poor criticism when they see it. It is also a good video for fellow essayists, a standard for us to hold ourselves to. Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Biopic You’re Not Allowed to See… by Be Kind Rewind Be Kind Rewind’s recounting of Superstar’s production, legacy, and legal troubles would be worthy of consideration on the strength of its writing and research alone, but it’s the videomaking which makes the work transcendent. Just as Todd Haynes used Barbie dolls to re-enact the life story of Karen Carpenter, so too does Isabel Custodio use Barbie dolls to tell the story of Haynes and his film. Formally ambitious and substantial. How David Lynch Saw the Bright Side by Broey Deschanel Doubling as a thoughtful analysis of David Lynch’s artistry and a moving tribute to a much beloved filmmaker, Deschanel’s video essay explores familiar aspects of Lynch’s work to arrive at an unexpected and underdiscussed conclusion. How Comedy Was Destroyed by an Anti-Reality Doomsday Cult by The Elephant Graveyard Most of The Elephant Graveyard’s video work has been dedicated to critiquing the modern comedy sphere dominated by Joe Rogan and his expanded circle. This video is his magnum opus. A damning portrait of how thoroughly MAGA politics and its figureheads have infiltrated pop culture through the guise of comedy that is also far funnier than any of the so-called comedians highlighted. Why the Terminator Uses a Phone Book by Jesse Tribble In an era of multi-hour deep dives, it’s refreshing to see a video essayist tackle something so small and seemingly inconsequential. In just under five minutes, Jesse offers a compelling read of the phone book as plot device in The Terminator, incorporating the conventions of genre cinema and even the history of the telephone itself in his analysis. PragerU’s Terrible Shakespeare Opinions, or Why I Stopped Talking About Shakespeare by Kyle Kallgren Stunning. More than just a cutting retort to PragerU’s bigotry and anti-intellectualism, this video essay thoroughly dismantles the notion that any artwork or artist can truly transcend the political and material realities in which they exist. Kyle Kallgren has since announced his retirement from videomaking on YouTube and this swan song is a reminder of how vital he’s been to the medium. Witty, rigorously researched, and willing to sit within uncomfortable complexities, this is an essential video essay. modern masculinity and The Critical Drinker by Man Carrying Thing Videos critiquing/debunking the bad film analysis of rage-bait YouTubers like The Critical Drinker have become a popular sub-genre on Film YouTube in recent years. But Man Carrying Thing zeroes in on a less-often discussed aspect of such channels: their appallingly lazy video editing. Video editor and podcast host How Comedy Was Destroyed by an Anti-Reality Doomsday Cult by The Elephant Graveyard In-depth verbal evisceration of Rogan and his orbiters. What Are ‘White People Tacos’? by Internet Shaquille Direct, succinct, funny, and insightful video about white people tacos and how they differ from their traditional Mexican counterparts. The Labubu Chronicles by Ro Ramdin Cultural commentary, poem, and opulent visual art feast all in one. ChatGPT Made Me Delusional by Eddy Burback What better way to demonstrate ChatGPT’s corrosive mental effects than to present it with one foundational delusion that it then runs with and builds upon to an astonishing degree? Filmmaker, author, video essayist I’ve never needed new ways of thinking than I do now. I live in hope for the next generation, that we may yet find the Godard of video essays Spectateurs! by Arnaud Desplechin Everything an essay should be: personal, beautiful, thoughtful, and Mathieu Amalric shows up. Disney’s Animatronics: A Living History by Kevin Perjurer Nothing like getting enchanted by a Defunctland piece I Fell in Love with a Quebec Reality Dating Show by Derin Emre Spritely and openhearted The Queen is Dead: Trans, Queer, and Femme Image in Last Exit to Brooklyn by Willow Maclay and Kat Ellinger A great probing look at a history still being discovered The Purplettes: The Room Next Door by Green and Red A lovely cubist deconstruction of a work that flows so effortlessly past its details. Making us better understand how an artist tells a story of death’s complications. Video essayist and independent scholar Breaking The Creepy AI in Police Cameras by Benn Jordan I asked the question “What is Cinema?” a lot this year. The primary site of screen reception is no longer the theatre or even the television, but rather everywhere else there’s a screen – phones, ATMs, rear-facing cameras on your car. Cinema is everywhere and nowhere. But more importantly, the camera itself no longer primarily resides in Hollywood or TV studios or even in your pocket, but in the vast array of always-on surveillance systems blanketing corporate and government buildings, roadsides, and doorbells, outfitted with licence plate readers and facial recognition AI, and piping all that visual and telemetric data into the hard drives of police, ICE, and privately-owned data brokers. What is cinema? Nowadays, it’s the surveillance grid. And so if we’re going to make meaningful video essays about seeing-knowledge-power in the world today, they’d better be interventions into that surveillance grid. And NO ONE this year has more meaningfully intervened on that apparatus than Benn Jordan, who EXPOSED the whole data collection system and BROKE the licence-plate-reading functionality on Flock Safety cameras in this video, then followed up by HACKING the entire 80,000-camera grid here. Everything else this year takes a back seat. The Rehearsal Season 2, Episode 3 ‘Pilot’s Code’, minutes 21 through 31 by Nathan Fielder Nathan Fielder’s The Rehearsal Season 2 might be the most multi-modal piece of media ever made. It’s so multi-modal that for 10 minutes in episode 3, he shifts into full-YouTuber fan-theory video-essay mode – but with two important twists. One: unlike the eisegetical crackpot nonsense that pollutes most of YouTube, I’m absolutely sold on Fielder’s Evanescence Hypothesis. Two: all of his corkboard-diagramming and cockpit-voice-recorder-timing are in the service of something beautiful: empathy for the private struggle of a public individual and the mental health epidemic hiding in plain sight behind it. All the jokes are serious, and that’s surpassingly rare and precious. Orwell: 2+2=5 by Raoul Peck While this film seems historically fated to not land with the urgency of Peck’s I Am Not Your Negro, that’s a shame – because the breadth of research, the adroit connections it makes to the present, and its empathy for Orwell’s life story are in all ways the equal of that great earlier work. Just when you think it’s only about propaganda and social control, it becomes about surveillance, AI (“The imagination will not breed in captivity” – Orwell), revolution, love, morality, and everything else that matters. This one speaks for itself. Panorama of Western State Penitentiary by Eli Jacob Boonin-Vail The best video essays exist at the junction of some set of concerns you didn’t previously realise intersected. This compact and impactful academic piece sits at the crossroads of contemporary film production, carceral technologies, media archaeology, and much more. What does it mean for a jail to be ‘well designed’? Why would we ever be happy to look at one? And yet from early cinema to the present we haven’t been able to stop aestheticising them. A worthwhile study, and maybe even a wake-up call. Why ChatGPT Can’t Draw a Full Glass of Wine by Alex O’Connor The best rumination on AI this year was Josh Geist’s You are a better writer than AI. (Yes, you.), but since I recognised him for his video on Winnie the Pooh and Candide a few years ago (still incredible!), this video offers another path through AI. From a simple question, posed in the title, Alex finds a new way to examine empiricism and potentially kickstart hundreds of Philosophy 101 discussions that haven’t been interesting to students in decades. I Solved Klotski by 2swap As a species, we went all-in on the eye. There’s almost no way we can meaningfully understand a set of numbers or the operation of a complex system directly. We have to invent a way to visualise it. I wish more video essayists started with that fundamental task: to find a new way to visualise something. It makes my year when someone makes something this jaw-droppingly gorgeous. What If We Made a Camera That Sees in Reverse? by Stuff Made Here For my final slot this year, I just want to shout-out all the ‘f*ck-around-and-find-out’ YouTubers who are still finding new ways of seeing things. Like Lensevision and his geometric camera filter experiments, Patrick Gillespie repeatedly blurring and sharpening an image, or, most amazingly, this video’s spinning camera rig that sees in unwrapped? reverse? perspective? behind things? … You really just have to see for yourself. Photography began with engineering. And it can be reborn every time an engineer decides to start from scratch again. It’s beautiful. Managing editor of Found Footage Magazine This 2025 short-list obviously fails to capture the full scope of the video essays that make critical use of found footage or pre-existing images. And the last year has brought an exceptional number of remarkable works. The titles highlighted here represent just one attempt to recognise video essays that engage meaningfully with the world around us. They tackle with creativity and courage global concerns such as the Palestinian conflict, racism, housing affordability, cultural heritage, collective identity or the inevitable ways in which mankind and technology interact. I hope this selection is a reminder of what we cannot miss. Another Other by Bex Oluwatoyin Thompson In a moment marked by fierce political polarization, a film like Another Other poses a lot of thought-provoking questions about profound social crisis and the right to freedom of expression in a democratic society. Houses We Can Own by Susana Bessa A fascination with the way houses are depicted in the movies becomes a video essay that reflects on how the environments we occupy influence personal experiences, beliefs and achievements. Houses We Can Own is a video essay which considers how architecture and spatial environments shape our identities and the narratives we build around our lives. The Sorrow of the Lynx by Michaela Grill Contemporary art plays an essential role in confronting the climate emergency. Michaela Grill’s The Sorrow of the Lynx delves into the natural world of Siberia to explore how this expansive ecosystem is being transformed by the growing pressures of global warming and man-made disasters, from widespread woodland fires to other environmental disruptions. Human Movie: Six Meditations on a Compression Algorithm by Eryk Salvaggio Blending glitched AI-generated imagery with archival images, Eryk Salvaggio’s work sheds light on how cognitive processes are simulated, onto how human consciousness is being emulated and imprisoned in today’s modern digital landscape. The Force by Wilma Stone I particularly like The Force. Wilma Stone’s video essay, while grounded in scholarship, is fully compatible with a work process that embraces a poetic approach to the archive to tell how colonial histories erase local knowledge, heritage, and identity. Film curator/Film studies PhD candidate (University of St Andrews) A mix of works I’m grateful to have discovered this year, including some unorthodox choices that share the critical and formal sensibilities at work in the liveliest and most perceptive video essays, and that perhaps hint at promising directions for the form. Flesh & Ghost by Sky Hopinka A transporting film of ghosts, flesh and echoes, which like many of Hopinka’s works, offers ways to feel for all that shimmers at the limits of knowing. A looped two-channel video, alive with the music of Courtney Asztalos, it approaches cycles of loss and return, grief and gratitude, through a Hočąk story, VHS tapes from Hopinka’s youth, and the shifting motions of poetry, myth, and memory. just above the tear duct on each side by Cat and Éiméar McClay Fragmenting texts found in the archival materials of the defunct St. Conal’s Psychiatric Hospital in Letterkenny, this singular work looks closely behind the harrowing statistic that during the 1950s, Ireland had the highest rate of psychiatric hospital use in the world. The imbrications of colonial and carceral logics with local social and religious dynamics interact with staggering force with the quiet, animated digital renditions of the dilapidated, life-crushing spaces that once housed them. Preliminary Notes for Thinking About a Place by Catalina Segú A vivid and affecting work about the interplay of sensing and being sensed by places, tracing the shifting limits of control when retrieving certain memories, where mechanisms of forgetting are dissolved and undone by the flesh. Through an exquisite sense of pace, the video essay gathers footage from Segú’s family video archives, military marches and parades from the Chilean dictatorship, TV shows, and a sensitive return to scenes from Lucrecia Martel’s films. Like the gesture it circles – a child jumping in a swimming pool without hesitation, Segú’s own, echoed in La cienega – the work moves between the surface and depths of personal and collective experiences, which shape the body. အသွင်ပြောင်းလဲမှုတစ်ခု/A Metamorphosis by Lin Htet Aung A restructuring of state television propaganda from Myanmar’s dictatorship into a formally exciting and unsettling broadcast. The work tends towards playful abstraction, where the official colours of the national flag interact with other colours that allude to new possibilities. Familiar language and images are retuned as elusive visuals and unnerving lullabies (using AI trained on the voice of the military dictator), which eschew footage of protests and state violence but retain an affective texture attuned to both the subtle and blatant workings of propaganda. A Brief History of Chasing Storms by Curtis Miller The tornado as destructive weather, visual icon, a thrilling and tragic event, linked to climate change, disaster capitalism, and mythologies of American film culture. A tactile and expansive work that balances memorable anecdotes with a range of archival materials. It organises stories teased from repeated journeys across the ‘Tornado Alley’ of the American Midwest into discrete episodes, while inviting sound to carry the work in open and surprising ways, engaging the iconic imagery of tornadoes and the anxieties and imaginaries they evoke with generous, critical, and moving depth. Artist, filmmaker and PhD student at the Faculty of Fine Arts (Brno University of Technology – VUT) Confession: This year, I haven’t seen nearly as many video essays as I used to. For this reason, my selection is eclectic and personal. It is not meant to be a selection of the so-called objectively best, but rather of what won me over the moment I encountered it. How Not to Remember Our Bodies by Lucie Rosenfeldová An impressive deconstruction of historical materials, supplemented by the author’s photographs, animations, and visualizations, deals with women’s reproductive rights in socialist Czechoslovakia. Unspectacular, but all the more disturbing and uncompromising. It raises fundamental questions about the autonomy of the female body in relation to bureaucracy and patriarchy. “What is ‘we’ when we say ‘ours’?” How Comedy Was Destroyed by an Anti-Reality Doomsday Cult by The Elephant Graveyard An answer to the question: Why did comedy get so shitty? Together with the creator of The Elephant Graveyard, you can dive into a deep rabbit hole where you will explore everything that the manosphere, Roganosphere, toxicity, alt-right, conspirituality, and the cult practices of charismatic but stupid leaders mean. You will see the world behind the mirror, as described by Naomi Klein in her book Doppelganger: A Trip into the Mirror World. Towards Eremos: Form, Emptiness, Posthumanism by Jáchym Šidlák The video essay attempts to describe the viewer’s experience of watching a film that seeks to adopt a posthumanist and more-than-human perspective. This is a difficult task on both levels. Judge for yourself how well it succeeds. Or rather, experience it for yourself. Head of the University of Massachusetts Film Studies Program The ParAIax View by Ariel Avissar Ariel Avissar is one of the most inventive and transformative video­essayists working today. (I could fill my entire poll with works by Ariel Avissar.) With This Is Not What I Normally Do he had already pushed the form into territories that felt unprecedented – often with conceptual audacity. The ParAIax View marks yet another leap forward. Here, Avissar invites AI systems to reimagine the notorious brainwashing montage from The Parallax View (1974), not as a simple remake but as a probing test of what happens when machinic hallucination encounters one of cinema’s most disturbing political visions. The result is quite mesmerising, revealing new tensions, distortions, and interpretive slippages that emerge when human intention meets algorithmic generation. And of course, this comes on the heels of his spectacular earlier Parallax View Piece (Laird’s Constraint) (forthcoming in Screenworks). See Under: Orient by Colleen Laird Colleen Laird’s first video essay Eye–Camera–Ninagawa was an absolute virtuoso deconstruction of the opening montage of Ninagawa’s Helter Skelter – so dazzling in its precision, originality, and skill that one might have thought it her opera maestra. We were not surprised by the string of similarly commanding works following it (she is such a brilliant videoessayist), yet it was hard to believe she could surpass it. And yet her latest video essay, See Under: Orient, goes beyond everything one could have anticipated. It is a work of breathtaking beauty and brilliance: a seamless fusion of sound, rhythm, and colour, carried by a theoretical sophistication that never weighs down its sensorial force. The piece marks a new pinnacle in Laird’s already extraordinary videographic practice – and one can only imagine that even greater achievements lie ahead. Pausas\Pauses by Rachel Randall and Catherine Grant Pausas/Pauses is a beautiful exploration of a gesture that recurs across contemporary Latin American cinema yet often slips past critical attention: the fleeting moments in which domestic, cleaning, and care workers momentarily step out of their demands and inhabit a fragile space of inwardness. Rachel Randall and Catherine Grant gather these slivers of rest – from windowsill gazes to sunlit pauses during commutes – and let them speak to each other through videographic montage, revealing a shared emotional register that written scholarship has largely overlooked. By placing scenes from seven films into conversation, they illuminate how these works imagine the workers’ inner worlds, even as those vantage points remain partially inaccessible to the filmmakers themselves. The result is a video essay that not only uncovers a quiet but persistent visual motif, but also brilliantly reflects on classed and gendered asymmetries of leisure. Pausas becomes, in this sense, a meditation on who is afforded the luxury to pause – and who must steal it. Painful Cinephilia: Daney, Rivette, Video and Kapó by Alan O’Leary Alan O’Leary is one of the most remarkable figures in videographic criticism. His work consistently combines rigor and creativity, producing video essays that are as intellectually compelling as they are aesthetically captivating. Selecting a single piece of his for this poll borders on the absurd: each one feels like a fully realised achievement, and the sheer breadth and vitality of his output mean that there is always a new gem to discover. From the ethical and formal subtlety of Painful Cinephilia: Daney, Rivette, Video, and Kapó, to the analytical playfulness of Classif. & Me (Laird’s Constraint), or the exquisite formal precision of Canister in Close Up (Payne’s Constraint) (these last two produced for Avissar’s Parametric Summer Series), to the collective ingenuity of Om Shanti Omnibus, produced in collaboration with the other members of IVERN, O’Leary’s oeuvre is consistently impressive. Any one of these works could easily stand as a landmark in videographic practice, yet together they demonstrate a rare, sustained mastery that continually expands the possibilities of the form. Potbelly by Dayna McLeod Dayna McLeod has an extraordinary talent for using humour as a powerful critical instrument for her feminist intervention – her humour is very sharp, and theoretically rich. In Potbelly – as also in Age Perfect, another brilliant video essay she produced this year – she distills complex debates in aging and gender into short pieces that have the power of carrying the force of entire scholarly articles. What might take pages of academic prose, McLeod conveys through wit, performance, and an unflinching attention to how older women’s bodies are read, regulated, and stereotyped. Her comedy never softens the critique; instead, it opens a conceptual space where laughter becomes a form of resistance and a method of knowing. These pieces are miniature in duration but expansive in impact – proof that videographic insight can be both concise and powerfully transformative (dis)Orientating Horror: Feeling Queerly by Lucy Fife Donaldson In (dis)Orientating Horror: Feeling Queerly, Lucy Fife Donaldson treats brilliantly the videographic form itself as a queer methodology, exploring how horror films disrupt spatial and bodily norms to produce disorientation that can be both unsettling and generative. Drawing on Sara Ahmed’s and Jennifer M. Barker’s ideas of embodied orientation, the essay traces moments – from the drone shot in Midsommar to camera movements in The Shining, The Descent, and other genre examples – that invert, twist, and destabilise the viewer’s sense of verticality and linearity. The piece demonstrates how the video essay can make theoretical insights tangible, turning the sensory intensity of horror into a reflection on queerness, embodiment, and the potential for new orientations in both film and life. Winner of the 2025 Marienbad Film Festival Audiovisual Essay Award, it exemplifies how critical practice can inhabit, rather than resolve, the pleasures and provocations of disorientation. Shadow Self: On Agnès Varda’s Documenteur by Sadia Quraeshi Shepard Shadow Self: On Agnès Varda’s Documenteur is a compelling investigation of the porous boundaries between academic analysis and creative practice, fiction and documentary, biography and autobiography. The video essay uses Varda’s film as a lens to explore how these categories intersect, allowing personal reflection and formal experimentation to illuminate one another. In just over seven minutes, it demonstrates how videographic work can enact the very concepts it theorises, producing insights that written scholarship alone might struggle to convey. Recognised with the Audiovisual Essay Award at the 2025 Marienbad Film Festival, this piece exemplifies how videography can blend rigor, artistry, and self-reflexivity in a seamless, evocative form. The voters on this poll were given the option to highlight ‘emerging voices’ in the video essay community. Some contributors chose to direct readers to specific videos, while others focused on an essayist’s whole body of work. Allie Meowy (nominated by Willow Q. Petri) Allie Meowy takes the deepest dives from angles you would never expect that are both hilarious and heartwarming in their sincerity. Amber Flannery Field (nominated by Clare O’Gara) I may be cheating slightly here, since Field has already created and published video essay-adjacent content on TikTok for several years. Given that she’s also been teasing a pivot to long-form YouTube video essays recently, though, I wanted to include her. Field is, in her own words, “the only good tour guide in New York City,” and her videos, which explore race, gender, popular culture, politics, community organising, the spaces and places of Washington DC and New York, and all the overlaps therein, are among the most compelling I’ve ever seen on TikTok. I’ve also never been more impressed by a person’s ability to unflinchingly deliver thought- and heart-wrenching commentary to a camera in so many different ways in so many different public places. Aurélie Coop (nominated by Lucy Fife Donaldson) Aurélie is in her final year at St Andrews, and produced a brilliant audiovisual essay for my course last year. Inspired by a range of sources, it draws on the range of audiovisual essay making in really inventive ways, while doing something distinctive and fresh. I’m very excited to see what she will make next! Casey Explosion (nominated by Willow Q. Petri) If you enjoy games and do not know who Casey Explosion is, you are missing out on some incredible recommendations. She has brought her thoughtful love of games to YouTube with some incredible videos. Celia Sainz (nominated by Alan O’Leary) Celia Sainz received her PhD this year from Mass Amherst, where she worked with Barbara Zecchi. Currently a Visiting Assistant Professor of Spanish at Williams College, she has already made herself a leading light in videographic ecocriticism (did she invent the term?). I think her non-anthropocentric approach to videographic film studies, as evidenced in video essays like KELLY REICHARDT’S BESTIARIO (published in [in]Transition), will be increasingly prominent. Comma Splice (nominated by Hizzy Hay) Great visual animations paired with strong analysis of a YouTube medium I had no familiarity with, yet still found really engaging. Creative Destruction Video (nominated by J. Nicholas Geist) The lyric essay in creative nonfiction gets a lot of pushback from all sides, because it refuses to accept a bright line between poetry and prose, or between fiction and nonfiction. But from those complicated, messy areas of overlap arise many of my favourite essays. I haven’t really seen anyone attempting to bring the lyric essay to the video space until I saw Creative Destruction’s Fugue State Waltz. He has continued to infuse the video essay with the lyric in his Jason Voorhees: Reagan’s Golem. His more experimental essays are challenging to both viewers and, unfortunately, the algorithm. I hope he continues down this path, though, because he is making some of the most interesting and exciting video essays I’ve seen. Dex Veitch (nominated by Lucy Fife Donaldson) Dex Veitch is a junior at UMass Amherst majoring in Comp Lit and Film Studies. His video essay The Cinematic Scar: Reconceptualizing Suture Theory won second place in the Michael S. Roif Award in Film Studies for Best Video Essay in 2025, and after seeing his embodiment exercises on Orphée, I was really impressed by their expressive density. Elsie Walker (nominated by Catherine Grant) Elsie is the second of two established scholars who, as a recent alumni of the Middlebury Workshop on Scholarship in Sound and Image, made a great impact as new video essayists on this year’s Adelio Ferrero Award for Video Essays. Elsie’s highly personal and moving video essay A Beautiful Day in the Tree of Life received an honourable mention. Eva Alvarez Vazquez (nominated by Alison Peirse) Her sound work is smart, corporeal, and effective. I can’t wait to see what she does next. HeyItMeBen (nominated by Denis (LambHoot)) 2025 marked Ben’s triumphant return after a year-long hiatus. His piece Searching for Hope in Iron Lung explores themes of desperation, illness, and hope. The piece examines a couple of examples that bridge the virtual and real worlds. Johanna Gustin (nominated by Kevin B. Lee) Gustin is a filmmaker and graduate student at the Stanford Documentary programme. Her desktop documentary I Think About Birds is a fascinating and ultimately breathtaking desktop documentary that draws surprising ties between manosphere/tradwife videos, nature documentaries and her own family yearnings. josh (with parentheses) (nominated by Denis (LambHoot)) Josh’s ‘let me share my screen’ approach is such a compelling storytelling technique. It’s easy to get immersed in these videos, which is strange since there’s literally an interface sitting between audience and topic. Maybe there’s something skeuomorphic going on (watching a video on a computer of a computer’s interface). We’ve forgotten how to forget and You are a better writer than AI. (Yes, you.) are great demonstrations of Josh’s signature style. Katarzyna Paszkiewicz (nominated by Alison Peirse) I’ve long admired Katarzyna Paszkiewicz’s cutting edge work in feminist film studies, and it is tremendously exciting to see this major scholar beginning to think videographically. Her style is cool and calm, a balm for the overstimulated. Katarzyna Paszkiewicz (nominated by Catherine Grant) Katarzyna’s amazing video essay Environmental Time, which she began working on while learning to edit at the Middlebury Workshop, was published by the Spanish academic journal Teknokultura. Revista de Cultura Digital y Movimientos Sociales in 2025. It brilliantly juxtaposes selected footage from Nomadland (2020) and Anthropocene: The Human Epoch (2018) to explore the films’ hauntological landscapes. It’s a powerful and important work and I cannot wait for more video essays by her to enter the public sphere. Laura Del Vecchio & Katarzyna Paszkiewicz (nominated by Maria Hofmann) The collaboration between Laura Del Vecchio, a multidisciplinary researcher, artist, musician, editor and translator, and Katarzyna Paszkiewicz, Associate Professor in English and Film Studies at the University of the Balearic Islands, on a rumble from the core of the earth, that elegantly brings together scholarly rigor and creative expression, makes me excited for any future works by them. Lilith Grasmug (nominated by Delphine Jeanneret) Lilith Grasmug is an Austrian actress born in Paris. In 2017, she starred in Virgil Vernier’s Sophia Antipolis before working with Jean-Christophe Meurisse, Mikhaël Hers, Carmen Jaquier, and Claire Burger. After studying at the ECAL film department in Lausanne, she is currently pursuing a Master’s degree in contemporary art research at the Sorbonne, under the supervision of Elvan Zabunyan. Some of You Fucked Eva is her first short film as a director. Linia Verde (nominated by Jiří Anger) A group of Romanian students, mentored by Ana Szel and Liri Chapelan, created a remarkable collection of video essays on the themes of hyperobjects and ecocriticism. Published in Film a doba under the title A Small Batch of Irrepresentable Entities, this collection displays a playfulness and an engagement with topics that reach beyond strict film studies toward the environmental humanities – both of which are more than welcome. Marine de Dardel (nominated by Kevin B. Lee) de Dardel is a doctoral researcher working with me and Johannes Binotto, and her videographic work makes bold experiments with textual, audiovisual and verbal language. The Colour Out of Space (linked above) uses creative coding to programme a future iteration of Locarno Film Festival using a dataset derived from the festival. Her other works of this year, (DES)ASTRES.ai and Promontorium Somnii (Post Mortem) each reveal distinctly different possibilities for videographic approaches to generative AI. Marta Cerón León (nominated by Dayna McLeod) I had the pleasure of working with Marta and some other incredible students in the Film Studies programme at the University of Massachusetts Amherst this fall where they are making really great work. In Embodied Sound, a brittle and crunchy soundscape reframes the pharmacy scene in Vuk Lungulov-Klotz’s 2023 Mutt, where the protagonist walks the aisles while on the phone. As Marta says, “the sound makes the space feel prescriptive, as if the drugs themselves speak or were making sounds while framing the body.” In two of her other videos that also work with Mutt – Supercut and OnScreen Cameo – Marta intervenes in scenes to show us how the main character is constantly framed, contained, and surveilled. Keep an eye out for Marta’s work! Maud Ceuterick (nominated by Alan O’Leary) Maud Ceuterick has published just two video essays so far, I think, but they are different enough, and so interesting in their individual ways, that they announce an important maker. The ferocious RAWR: Kitchen Rage Judith and I was published last year in Teknokultura. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen abjection mobilised like this in a scholarly context. Filming Out Loud, made in dialogue with the anthropologist Carola Ludovica Giannotti Mura and published in Academic Quarter, interrogates the epistemic and ethical affordances of videographic criticism with sensitivity and reflexive intelligence. May Santiago (nominated by Alan O’Leary) May Santiago, a performance academic based in Baltimore, has already been nominated multiple times for this poll. She describes her PhD work as archiving as activism, or as a counter to the colonial archive of Puerto Rico. Video essays such as Desidentificación (published in Burges and Cooper’s Personal Mediascapes collection) and Agencia (presented at SCMS in Chicago this year), combine archival and performative material, self-generated footage and personal revelation. They are incredibly intense and somehow intensely glamorous. Noa Epars & Marvin Merkel (nominated by Delphine Jeanneret) Born in 1998 in Penthalaz, he is of Swiss origin. After obtaining a bachelor’s degree in French Literature and History at the University of Lausanne, he began studying cinema at the HEAD – Geneva (University of Art and Design) in 2021. In 2022, he co-directed Serafina, presented in official competition at the 75th Locarno Film Festival and at the New Directors/New Films Festival at the MoMA. The same year, he directed The Misanthrope, presented in several European festivals. Marvin Merkel is a Lausanne-based artist who combines photography with his sculptural and performative work. The nominator specifically highlighted their newest piece, Always Wanted to Be God, Never Wanted to Do Good. Renegade Cut (nominated by Willow Q. Petri) While he has been making videos for a long time, his recent pivot into making whatever he wants has been an incredible creative inspiration to what video essays can be. Rotem Sudman (nominated by Colleen Laird) Rotem Sudman is an extraordinarily promising emerging voice whose work moves with equal measures of young intellectual rigor and technical precision informed by moral courage and a palpably bursting heart. My first encounter with her videographic essay was through her entry on Terrace House in the TV Dictionary series (published in [in]Transition), which I reviewed. Sudman is a deft editor, but she is also something rarer: a maker who understands the video essay as a method of critical witnessing. Her ongoing research demonstrates a profound commitment to rethinking film’s relationship to history, memory, political struggle, and stakes. Sudman brings a perspective that is both ethically attuned and urgently needed. Forthcoming in 2026 peer-reviewed publications, her efforts confront the violences operational in archival erasure while offering space for counter-narratives to emerge. Sudman’s work gives me hope. Salomé Aguilera Skvirsky (nominated by Catherine Grant) Salomé is one of two established scholars who, as recent alumna of the Middlebury Workshop on Scholarship in Sound and Image, made a great impact as new video essayists on this year’s Adelio Ferrero Award for Video Essays. Salomé’s astonishingly original work Our Morals and Theirs on the Chilean film El chacal de Nahueltoro (Miguel Littín, 1969) took first prize. Samantha Wojcik (nominated by Jenny Oyallon-Koloski) Samantha’s work, inspired by Agnès Varda’s The Gleaners and I, was in high consideration for the first annual graduate student video essay award organised through the Society for Cinema and Media Studies, judged by myself, Allison Cooper (Bowdoin College), and Andrea Comiskey (Carnegie Mellon University). She uses an expanded definition of ‘gleaning’ to take the spectator on a joyous, eclectic tour of queer and queer-adjacent imagery, concluding with an exhilarating performance in the desktop documentary form. Sarah Davis Baker (nominated by Dan Schindel) Baker has come out of the gate as a video essayist with some really strong stuff this year. She’s very thoughtful and has done a great job of finding novel topics and approaching them from unexpected angles. Check out The Internet Used to Be a Place. Silvia Cipelletti (nominated by Kevin B. Lee) Cipelletti is part of my research group and in 2025 really came into her own with several video essays, Mediterranean Border and Algorithmic Borders (later adapted into a segment for the TV series PhantasIA), which are part of her doctoral dissertation research on videographic approaches to border landscapes, and her collaboration with Evelyn Kreutzer Locarno parla italiano – 404!: Glitching Locarno Film Festival explored the divided realities under the surface of a celebratory event. All these works demonstrate an energetic and self-exposing approach to negotiating between desktop and ethnographic field research. Therapist Plus Gamer (nominated by Denis (LambHoot)) Jared (Therapist Plus Gamer) has been doing one of my favourite things on this platform: bringing real-life professional expertise into video essays. I’m glad he finds the time to be so productive at crafting well-made, educational, and entertaining videos. Watching his latest piece during lunch is a ritual I look forward to every week. Timothée Engasser (nominated by Delphine Jeanneret) Born in Saint-Sébastien-sur-Loire in 1991, Timothée Engasser lives and works between Marseille and Lille. A graduate in urban sociology with a thesis in research and creation (ENSAV/Université du Mirail), he has pursued the themes of his research in cinematographic works on the edge of reality, between documentary and experimental. His films include Tenace, Il y a un endroit dans la nuit and Omens bloom in the dark, which have been screened at a number of international festivals (International Kurzfilmtage Winterthur, Les Yeux ouverts, Entrevues de Belfort, FRAC Grand Large). He seeks to explore the imaginary worlds among traces, ruins and gaps. The nominator specifically highlighted their piece, Home Is Where the Heart Is. Tingyu Chen (nominated by Jenny Oyallon-Koloski) Tingyu’s videographic analysis of Chantal Akerman’s Jeanne Dielman was highly ranked by Allison Cooper (Bowdoin College), Andrea Comiskey (Carnegie Mellon University), and myself for the first annual graduate student video essay award organised through the Society for Cinema and Media Studies. This ambitious project intensifies the film’s spatial qualities using deformative methods to expand our understanding of a film better known for its durational representation of women’s labor. Toni’s Film Club (nominated by Queline Meadows) While Toni has been releasing videos for a few years now, he seemed to really hit his stride in 2025. He puts a ton of effort into everything he makes (many of his recent videos include interviews) and I can’t wait to see what he does next. Valeria Villegas Lindvall (nominated by Alison Peirse) A major new thinker in decolonial horror criticism, Valeria Villegas Lindvall is now finding her voice in videographic criticism. And that voice is raw punk energy. weisensei (nominated by Hizzy Hay) A video essayist with a background as a story artist, which provides a unique perspective on what makes media excel.

December 24, 2025 06:55 ET | Source: YieldMax YieldMax CHICAGO and MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Dec. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax® ETFs today announced distributions for the YieldMax® Group 2 weekly pay ETFs. Group 2 Distribution Announcement Ex. & Record Date: December 26, 2025Payment Date: December 29, 2025 Performance data quoted represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted above. Performance current to the most recent month-end can be obtained by calling (866) 864-3968. For the most recent STANDARDIZED AND MONTH-END PERFORMANCE, please click on the ETF ticker below: Each Fund has a limited operating history, and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. Note: CRSH, DIPS, FIAT, WNTR and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs.” Distributions are not guaranteed. The Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield are not indicative of future distributions, if any, on the ETFs. In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). 1 All YieldMax® ETFs shown in the table have a gross expense ratio of 0.99%.2 The Distribution Rate shown is as of close on December 23, 2025. The Distribution Rate is the annual distribution rate an investor would receive if the most recent distribution, which includes option income, remained the same going forward. The Distribution Rate is calculated by annualizing an ETF’s Distribution per Share and dividing such annualized amount by the ETF’s most recent NAV. The Distribution Rate represents a single distribution from the ETF and does not represent its total return. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gains, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These Distribution Rates may be caused by unusually favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future.3 The 30-Day SEC Yield represents net investment income, which excludes option income, earned by such ETF over the 30-Day period ending November 30, 2025, expressed as an annual percentage rate based on such ETF’s share price at the end of the 30-Day period.4 Each ETF’s strategy (except those of the Short ETFs) will cap potential gains if its reference asset’s shares increase in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset’s shares decrease in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. Each Short ETF’s strategy will cap potential gains if its reference asset decreases in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset increases in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF.5 ROC refers to Return of Capital. The ROC percentage indicates how much the distribution reflects an investor's initial investment. The figures shown for each Fund in the table above are estimates and may later be determined to be taxable net investment income, short-term gains, long-term gains (to the extent permitted by law), or return of capital. Actual amounts and sources for tax reporting will depend upon the Fund's investment activities during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Your broker will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year to tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Important Information This material must be preceded or accompanied by the prospectus. For all prospectuses, click here. Tidal Investments, LLC is the adviser for all YieldMax® ETFs. THE FUND, TRUST, AND ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Referenced Index Risk. The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Index (or the Index ETFs). This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of companies that comprised the Index or an ETF that tracks the Index, even though it does not. Indirect Investment Risk. The Index is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved with this offering in any way. Investors in the Fund will not have the right to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights with respect to the companies that comprise the Index but will be subject to declines in the performance of the Index. Russell 2000 Index Risks. The Index, which consists of small-cap U.S. companies, is particularly susceptible to economic changes, as these firms often have less financial resilience than larger companies. Market volatility can disproportionately affect these smaller businesses, leading to significant price swings. Additionally, these companies are often more exposed to specific industry risks and have less diverse revenue streams. They can also be more vulnerable to changes in domestic regulatory or policy environments. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political events, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund’s expenses. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR, MARA, CVNA, HOOD, BRK.B, DKNG, RBLX, RDDT, GME, HIMS, CRCL), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Indirect Investment Risk. The Index is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved with this offering in any way. Risk Disclosure (applicable only to MARO) Digital Assets Risk: The Fund does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than the Fund. Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting, and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Shorting Risk. The Fund may enter into a short sale by selling a security it has borrowed (typically from a broker or other institution). If the market price of a security increases after the Fund borrows the security, the Fund will suffer a (potentially unlimited) loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price. In certain cases, purchasing a security to cover a short position can itself cause the price of the security to rise further, thereby exacerbating the loss. In addition, the Fund may not always be able to borrow the security at a particular time or at an acceptable price. The Fund may also take a short position synthetically through use of derivatives. Synthetic short positions, achieved through derivatives such as options, additionally expose the Fund to the inherent risks of derivatives (described above). These combined risks can result in greater losses for the Fund than those associated with direct short sales, potentially preventing the Fund from achieving its investment objective. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared ("cleared derivatives"). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house ("clearing members") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political events, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA, MSTR), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © websummit / Flickr Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is one of the top hedge funds today. It has over $100 billion in assets, and the fund has made solid moves despite market uncertainties. Following the steps of billionaires can help you build a portfolio that stands the test of time. However, due diligence is very important. Bridgewater Associates has made several transactions in the third quarter, and it is reflected in the 13F reports. However, the billionaire has played safe with his investments. His top holdings include two tech titans and two ETFs. Here’s why I’d recommend them too. Bridgewater Associates has the highest allocation in the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:IVV), comprising 10.62% of the portfolio. The hedge fund increased its position by 4.83% in the third quarter. Bridgewater owns more than 1 million shares of the ETF and started investing in IVV in 2010. IVV has $733 billion in assets under management. The ETF provides exposure to large-cap companies in the U.S. and tracks the performance of the S&P 500 index. IVV invests in the 500 top U.S. companies based on their market capitalization. This means its top holdings include Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon. The fund has a yield of 1.04% and pays quarterly dividends. Its highest allocation lies in the technology sector at 34.36%, followed by financials (13.38%) and consumer discretionary (10.56%). IVV has a low expense ratio of 0.03% and has generated a cumulative 3-year return of 94.83% and a 5-year return of 114.12%. IVV has gained 17.09% in 2025 and is exchanging hands for $687.83. The fund has the potential to outperform the broader market in the coming years. With more than two decades of history, the fund has established itself as a strong player offering broad U.S. equity exposure. Ja Crispy / Shutterstock.com Bridgewater has the second-highest position in State Street’s S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: SPY), which makes up 6.69% of the total portfolio. The fund also tracks the performance of the S&P 500 and is the first exchange-traded fund listed in the United States. SPY is a low-risk investment that ensures steady capital appreciation. It has gained 17.41% in 2025 and is exchanging hands for $684.83. The fund holds 503 stocks and has an expense ratio of 0.09%. It has a yield of 1.04% and has the highest allocation in the information technology sector (34.08%), followed by financials (13.55%) and consumer discretionary (10.62%). Similar to IVV, its top 10 holdings include industry stalwarts such as Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, and Meta Platforms. Despite making several buy and sell transactions, Dalio prefers to stick to some ETFs, and SPY is one of them. It can help build a strong foundation for your portfolio. The fund has generated a cumulative 3-year return of 20.43% and a 5-year return of 15.12%. With SPY, you get to own the biggest companies across industries. IVV and SPY are virtually identical in many ways. Both track the S&P 500 index and have generated similar returns over time. Prykhodov / iStock Editorial via Getty Images Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) forms 2.53% of Bridgewater’s portfolio and holds more than 3 million shares. While the hedge fund has trimmed its position over time, it still remains one of the top holdings. Looking at Dalio’s holdings, it shows that he’s bullish on the tech sector. Alphabet has gained 61.89% in 2025 and is exchanging hands for $308.61. It has a comprehensive AI ecosystem that ensures steady revenue growth. While the company is known for the dominating Google search engine, it has a massive empire that continues to grow. Its search engine continues to lead the industry, while YouTube has become the largest streaming platform today. Its numbers are impressive. It reported a revenue of $102.3 billion, up 16% year over year, while the net income jumped 33%. Its cloud revenue soared 34% to $15.2 billion, and Google Services revenue jumped 14% to $87.1 billion. Its cloud division has gained a multi-year deal worth $10 billion with Palo Alto Networks, aimed at expanding the AI-driven security infrastructure. There’s plenty of growth still to come. Wall Street remains bullish on the stock as its core business continues to thrive. A Wedbush analyst has an Outperform rating for the stock with a price target of $350. 2024 Getty Images / Getty Images News via Getty Images Tech dinosaur Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) forms 2.23% of Dalio’s portfolio. While he has trimmed his stake in the company during the third quarter, Microsoft continues to remain one of the top five holdings. The tech giant has seen a steady climb and continued optimism by Wall Street experts. AI will accelerate Microsoft’s growth, and the demand for Microsoft’s Azure cloud infrastructure has outpaced supply. There’s a lot of talk about Microsoft’s AI rollout across its entire product stack and the expansion of CoPilot in Windows. In the recently announced results, the company beat earnings and revenue expectations. It reported a revenue of $77.67 billion, up 18% year over year, and an EPS of $4.13. Its cloud segment recorded a growth of 28% with a revenue of $30.9 billion, being one of the biggest growth drivers for the business. MSFT stock has gained 15.80% year to date and is exchanging hands for $484.72. It has a dividend yield of 0.75% and has raised dividends every year since 2010. Despite the low yield, it is an excellent dividend stock to own. The company has increased its dividend by 250% in the past decade. However, the stock price has gone up; hence, the yield has dropped. Despite trimming his stake, Dalio believes in the future of Microsoft and has held the stock since 2005. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

In July 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) released the 23rd Model List of Essential Medicines (EML) for adults and the 9th Model List of EML for children. These lists serve as global references for essential medicines that should be universally available, accessible, and affordable. This editorial explores recent updates to the WHO EML lists, with a particular focus on medicines addressing neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). We discuss the persistent barriers to equitable access, including economic, regulatory, and logistical challenges; highlight global initiatives aimed at improving accessibility; and propose strategies to bridge the gap in essential medicine access. We emphasize the need for international collaboration, increased funding for research institutions, pharmaceutical companies, and global health initiatives to support the development of novel treatments for NTDs, and innovative distribution approaches to ensure these medications reach underserved populations.

Funding: The authors received no specific funding for this work. Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Essential medicines are chosen according to a population’s health priorities. Selection is made based on disease prevalence, evidence for efficacy and safety, and cost-effectiveness—criteria established by the World Health Organization (WHO) and reaffirmed in 2024 [1,2]. These same criteria were applied to the 23rd Model List of Essential Medicines (EML) in 2023, which this editorial examines. Since its first publication in 1977, the EML has guided national medicine policies and improved the availability of life-saving medicines to all who need them [3], yet around 2 billion people globally still lack access to essential medicines, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [1–4]. Recent analyses confirm that affordability challenges remain pressing even in 2025, with essential generics still unaffordable for many households [5]. Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are ancient illnesses of poverty that impose a devastating human, social, and economic burden on over 1 billion people annually [2], primarily in tropical and subtropical regions among vulnerable, marginalized populations. Over 90% of NTDs affect LMICs, thriving in environments marked by inadequate sanitation and weak healthcare infrastructure [6]. NTDs include, but are not limited to, lymphatic filariasis, trachoma, onchocerciasis, leishmaniasis, and schistosomiasis. Despite their significant impact, NTDs remain underfunded in both research and pharmaceutical industry investments compared to other global diseases. Although NTDs represented nearly 20% of the infectious disease burden in 2022, they still accounted for less than 0.5% of global health Research and Development (R&D) funding [7]. The 23rd Model List of Essential Medicines of the WHO (2023) is significant for its increased emphasis on infectious diseases, antimicrobial stewardship, and the equitable medicine distribution. Nevertheless, the primary obstacles to accessing essential medicines in the LMICs remain. This editorial will highlight some of these challenges and illustrate how real-world evidence can be used to address them in the context of policymaking. Although malaria is not classified by the WHO as a NTD [8], it disproportionately affects underserved and vulnerable populations in many LMICs and faces similar barriers to equitable medicine access. Therefore, in this editorial, malaria is included in certain sections as a comparative example to highlight overlapping challenges and potential shared solutions. The WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (EML) was first introduced in 1977 to assist countries in identifying those essential and cost-effective medicines that should be made available to the population [1]. The list has become a global reference. Updated every two years, the list now informs national essential medicine policies in more than 110 countries [3]. The WHO EML criteria for selecting medicines are: The WHO EML is further divided into two lists: By serving as a global reference, the EML guides procurement, supply chain planning, and policymaking at the national level [1]. It also plays a role in supporting universal health coverage by identifying treatments that should be accessible, affordable, and available to all populations [4]. The 55 new medicines were recommended for inclusion in the 23rd WHO Model List (2023), and 9 existing drugs had their indications expanded. This update focuses on infectious diseases, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and affordability [1]. The 2023 WHO EML includes several additions and revisions that directly impact the prevention and treatment of NTDs. Primarily, the inclusion of pediatric formulations for leishmaniasis and schistosomiasis addresses long-standing gaps in child-appropriate dosing and administration, a key barrier in endemic regions [1,8]. Updated recommendations for antiparasitic medicines enhance treatment efficacy and may help mitigate resistance development [1]. Although malaria is not classified as an NTD, the addition of newer artemisinin-based combination therapies offers lessons in scaling up access to essential medicines for other diseases affecting neglected populations [8]. These updates, while important, highlight remaining gaps; for example, the absence of certain NTD treatments from the core list, limited guidance on affordable procurement mechanisms for LMICs, and the need for stronger links between the EML and national procurement systems [1,9]. The 2023 updates are consistent with the WHO’s efforts to address issues of equity in access to medicines on a global level. However, policy changes and more funding are required for real-world adoption. More than one billion people are affected by NTDs, mainly in Africa, South Asia, and Latin America [2]. These diseases hold and maintain people in the poverty cycle through long-term health impairment, disability, and reduced economic productivity. Some examples are: However, there has been less investment in research and development for NTDs than for diseases that are more common in high-income countries, resulting in the treatment gap and slow development of new treatments [6]. Approximately 2 billion people, especially in LMICs, are still faced with great challenges in obtaining the essential medicines as data shows that over 50% of public health facilities in LMICs experience regular stock-outs [10]. These barriers are a result of economic factors, policy barriers, weak health systems, and pharmaceutical industry factors [4,11]. Despite persisting challenges, global access to essential medicines did not stop improving. WHO reports that global access to essential medicines rose from 50% in 2015 to 65% in 2022 [1]. The upward trend in access demonstrates successful worldwide initiatives, but LMICs continue to face substantial access challenges. The high cost and low health care financing in LMICs is a major factor that limits the access to essential medicines for NTDs. The inability of most national health systems to afford essential medicines has led to stockouts or mimicking donor-dependent programmes [12–15]. Recent WHO reporting and 2025 analyses reaffirm that affordability gaps persist despite progress [5]. Access to medicines in LMICs is frequently hindered by regulatory and logistical barriers. Lengthy drug approval processes delay market entry, while weak procurement and distribution systems contribute to recurring stock-outs of essential medicines. Inadequate quality control and limited regulatory oversight also increase the prevalence of counterfeit or substandard products. Together, these challenges create systemic barriers that prevent timely and equitable access to essential medicines in LMICs [9,16,17]. The lack of profits in the market for NTDs removes incentives for pharmaceutical companies to conduct research and development of new treatments. This market failure can be addressed by public–private partnerships (PPPs), subsidies, and advance market commitments that reduce the financial risks and ensure demand [10]. Funding, tax incentives, and volume guarantees are some of the mechanisms that provide funding and make NTD treatments more attractive to pharmaceutical investors [18,19]. Uncertainty of demand discourages pharmaceutical companies from investing in NTD treatments. Without predictable markets, R&D for low-profit diseases remains unattractive. The financing tool known as Advanced Purchase Commitments (APCs) helps minimize financial risks that come from developing treatments for NTDs. The guaranteed market through APCs gives pharmaceutical companies the necessary certainty to conduct R&D for diseases that generate limited profits. The Global Fund together with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) has implemented APCs to promote vaccine development for malaria and rotavirus while similar models should be used for NTDs [10]. Similar models, if applied to NTDs, could help overcome this barrier and stimulate innovation [18,19] Pricing remains a fundamental barrier to equitable access for NTD medicines. Pharmaceutical companies implement tiered pricing structures which enable them to establish varying medication costs based on the income level of each purchasing nation. While the HIV/AIDS sector demonstrates successful implementation of this pricing model through antiretroviral drugs that maintain affordability for low-income nations, NTD medicines have not benefited from similar arrangements. The absence of transparent fair pricing model and mechanisms creates a barrier for LMICs that must fund NTD programs largely without donor subsidies. Without adaptation of tiered pricing to NTD medicines, affordability remains a critical obstacle to equitable access [5,12–14] Pharmaceutical companies often lack financial incentives to pursue R&D for NTDs, as these conditions primarily affect low-income populations with limited market potential. Tax credits serve as incentives that can motivate pharmaceutical companies to invest in NTD drug development. Governments could provide tax reductions to pharmaceutical companies that dedicate specific parts of their R&D funding to neglected diseases. This approach would help ease the financial burden on companies while enhancing their interest in developing treatments for NTDs. A relevant example is the Orphan Drug Tax Credit in the United States, which successfully stimulated investment in therapies for rare diseases by reducing the effective cost of development [12]. Analyses of the neglected disease R&D landscape highlight persistent financing gaps and underscore the need for targeted incentives to overcome the innovation deficit [18,19]. More recently, frameworks such as the UBC Global Access Principles have demonstrated how aligning innovation incentives with equitable access goals can further ensure that new medicines benefit populations in LMICs [20]. Adapting such tax-based incentives for NTDs could help fill critical innovation gaps and align private sector efforts with public health needs. NTDs are a subset of infectious diseases that account for 19% of global disease burden, yet they have obtained less than 0.5% of global health funding and development funding during the last decade—far less than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, or malaria [4,7]. WHO’s initiatives and rising use of real-world evidence attempt to address these deficiencies by providing new approaches to enhance the availability, affordability, and distribution of these potentially life-saving drugs. Notwithstanding these efforts and the increasing momentum in the global fight against NTDs by international health organizations, governments, pharmaceutical companies, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the challenge of equitable access to essential medicines persists. WHO is central in setting up global standards as well as frameworks for action to combat NTDs. Accelerating programmatic action, increasing cross-sectoral collaboration, and strengthening country ownership are the three key strategic pillars of the WHO’s activities in this regard based on the Global Strategy for Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases (2021–2030) [21]. Some of the components are: In countries with high prevalence of certain diseases including lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, and schistosomiasis, the World Health Organization has recommended preventive chemotherapy and has initiated Mass Drug Administration (MDA) campaigns. In this regard, the 2021 MDA campaign covered more than 800 million people in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia [1] with the assistance of the WHO. The WHO works with organizations like the Global Drug Facility and the Medicines Patent Pool to ensure the availability and affordability of essential medicines that include antimalarials, antiparasitic, and tuberculosis drugs [22]. By voluntary licensing agreements, generic competition, and pooled procurement mechanisms, these partnerships have brought down prices and improved access to medicine in LMICs. For instance, licensing of intellectual property has helped in the affordable procurement of essential medicines in LMICs, resulting in reduced costs and increased treatment coverage [23]. Other global health organizations, including Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi), Gavi, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, have also been involved in financing and delivering essential medicines to WHO. DNDi has provided affordable treatments for leishmaniasis, sleeping sickness, and Chagas disease and more than 2.4 million people have benefited from the life-saving drugs [7]. Especially, the Gates Foundation has made contributions towards vaccine development Global health R&D funding and large-scale disease eradication including malaria and NTDs initiatives. New antibacterial agents and artemisinin-based combination therapies for malaria were added to the 2023 WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, and WHO continued to manifest concern towards antimicrobial stewardship [1]. These initiatives are essential but require further global investment and sustainable funding mechanisms to ensure long-term success. Recent drug approvals have focused on NTDs [24] and AMR [25]. For example, Oral Amphotericin B, which has been developed under UBC’s Global Access Principles, has been listed as a WHO priority medicine for visceral leishmaniasis owing to its cost-effectiveness, thermal stability, and safety in the LMICs [26]. Furthermore, Hancock Lab’s immunomodulatory peptides are effective in combating bacterial, viral, and fungal infections thus supporting WHO’s AMR strategy [26]. WHO functions as the primary organization that develops global strategies to combat NTDs. The effectiveness of these strategies depends heavily on how countries execute them. The National Strategic Plan for malaria elimination in India has achieved a substantial reduction in transmission by using MDA campaigns and enhancing diagnostic testing capabilities [27]. The WHO supports Uganda’s MDA program for river blindness, which has effectively decreased the disease prevalence in affected areas [21]. Brazil implemented WHO-recommended Chagas disease control measures for diagnosis treatment and vector control, which led to a decrease in new infections [15]. The WHO collaborated with Senegal to achieve near-eradication of guinea worm disease, which serves as an exemplary model for NTD control [28]. Here, we identify and highlight key policy, financial, and technological innovations that fit into global health strategies and have been endorsed by WHO [21], DNDi [29], Gavi [30], and other international organizations that can help achieve the vision of increasing access to essential medicines for NTDs. In support of and advocacy for these approaches, and consistent with the mission of NGDI, we stress the importance of more partnerships and implementation efforts. Emphasizing the development of domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing in LMICs is to address dependence on imported medicines and increase the affordability of the former. WHO recommends that countries should: While existing PPPs have played a role in NTD drug donations, expanding these collaborations requires additional measures: WHO’s 2023 Essential Medicines List has been updated to address global health needs in 2025, but significant barriers still hinder equitable access to essential medicines for NTDs. To overcome these challenges, we need stronger global and national policy interventions, more funding for R&D, and technology-based solutions. Through improved cooperation and coordination between governments, pharmaceutical companies, and international health organizations, the global health community can enhance availability of essential medicines and work towards the eradication of NTDs.
