We regret any inconvenience. The world today was engineered to be ephemeral and noisy. This is a terrible combination for an investor. On Twitter alone, there are 456,000 messages sent every minute. On Facebook, there are 510,000 comments posted every minute and 293,000 status updates. Outside of social media, there are 16 million text messages sent every minute and 156 million emails. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MARCH 27: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during ... [+] afternoon trading on March 27, 2024 in New York City. Stocks closed out high with the Dow Jones leading closing over 400 points and is on pace to end March with its fifth straight positive month, the longest streak since August 2020 and the S&P snapping a three day streak of losses. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) For an investor, the antidote to noise is quality stock analysis. Due diligence requires dozens of hours per equity, and it takes hundreds of hours every year to produce a free newsletter with quality analysis. My firm, the I/O Fund, strives to offer some of the team’s best analysis for free, and I believe the consistency and depth of what my firm provides for free is hard to replicate. My firm offers this in the most challenging sector for investors, which is hands-down the tech sector. The tech sector is unusually difficult because it involves many different verticals – artificial intelligence, crypto, consumer, media, cloud, and more. It’s also the highest risk and highest reward sector in the market. Due to sudden price movements in both directions, the stakes are high. Perhaps I am biased, but quality analysis particularly in the tech sector can be hard to come by. Below are highlights from my free analysis on Forbes during a strong year for AI and crypto. Although numerous investor favorites rose more than 100% during the year, many other popular tech stocks declined significantly. My firm offered our readers clues and insights for the leading stocks in AI semiconductors and software, providing unparalleled depth and quality to our free readers. Right out the gate in 2024, I expanded on my highly regarded 2021 prediction that Nvidia would surpass Apple’s valuation within 5 five years; which at the time, this prediction was inconceivable as it would require not only Nvidia to go up more than 300%, but also for the tech leader Apple to plateau. I explained why Nvidia would deliver on this prediction a whole 2 years early in the February 2024 analysis, Nvidia Stock Gained $1.5 Trillion To Surpass The FAANGs - Apple Is Next. In the analysis, I pointed out that it was not just the consistency and magnitude of Nvidia’s multi-billion dollar revenue beats, but the expansion of its margins and earnings as revenue grew >200% for multiple quarters as it approached a $90 billion annualized scale. From that August 2021 prediction to the February 2024 update, Nvidia posted some staggering growth numbers: · Data center revenue grew 676% to $18.4 billion. Data center revenue scaled from a $10 billion run rate to a $75 billion run rate in 2.5 years, a feat that took AWS 6 years to accomplish. · Nvidia’s total revenue increased 240% during the period driven by blazing data center growth, versus a 43% increase for Apple, with iPhone revenue rising just 4.5% from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2023. · Nvidia’s quarterly EPS grew nearly 400% during the period, versus just 14% for Apple. · Nvidia’s operating margin increased from 47% to nearly 67%, while Apple’s expanded from 28% to 34%. My firm provided a handful of reasons that would propel Nvidia to quickly become the world’s most valuable company. This included the long runway for AI accelerators – AMD’s executives forecast the market to reach $400 billion by 2027 – with Nvidia taking the lion’s share. Nvidia’s accelerated product roadmap to a one-year release cadence lets it continue to pry away Big Tech capex, while the software opportunity beckons, already reaching a $1B+ run rate. These tailwinds combined with a valuation that was “eerily low” at the time considering the rapid ascent shares had made through 2023. Supply chain and demand signals point to 2025 being another strong year for Nvidia as Blackwell comes to market, with my firm tracking these data points to assess Nvidia’s growth potential in the year to come. I published numerous free analyses on Nvidia’s Blackwell; some of this explaining back in May why there was still room in the stock price as I called out institutional analyst estimates being too low (which later materialized). I also boldly wrote that delays on Blackwell were overblown, and we have gotten yet another confirmation from Nvidia’s management team at CES that Blackwell is shipping on time. My firm’s ongoing consistency and accuracy on this stock dating back to 2018 for up to 4,000% returns has been unparalleled —premium members received nine real-time buy alerts below $20 in 2021 and 2022; learn more here. · Nvidia Q1 Earnings Preview: Blackwell And The $200B Data Center · Nvidia Stock: Blackwell Suppliers Shrug Off Delay Ahead Of Q2 Earnings · Here’s Why Nvidia Stock Will Reach $10 Trillion Market Cap By 2030 · Nvidia Stock Is A Buy On Dips Before Blackwell Arrives In 2025 · Nvidia’s Stock Has 70% Potential Upside For 2025 My firm provided two crucial updates on our game plan for Bitcoin, with his first update from April 2024 increasing our target price zones. At the time, Bitcoin was an overlooked asset compared to the over-hyped Mag 7, yet the asset has delivered superior returns compared to all of the great large-cap tech stocks in this bull cycle, minus Nvidia, while having a low inverse correlation to tech. Utilizing technical analysis and on-chain data in the analysis We Are Raising Our Bitcoin Targets To $106K - $190K, my firm explained that it was now raising its target zones for Bitcoin to $106,000 to $190,000, up from the previous zone of $75,000 to $130,000. Bitcoin was trading in the mid-$60,000 range at the time, as my firm noted that “the $42,750 support region holds on any ongoing volatility, then we have no reason to doubt the uptrend in place.” My firm provided another update to the Bitcoin thesis at the end of July 2024 in the analysis, Bitcoin Update: Next Stop $100,000; Bitcoin finally surpassed that historic level as 2024 came to a close. My firm explained that Bitcoin had “a full corrective pattern in place that ended around $54,000 in early July,” which “suggests we are in the early stages of the next rally.” My firm had systematically been accumulating since the start of this cycle while raising our critical supports along the way — below is the history of Bitcoin buy alerts that my firm issued to our subscribers in real-time since early 2023. The I/O Fund sent out numerous buy alerts for BTC below $60,000 since early 2023. Notably, my firm assisted readers in capturing immense upside from the two top-performing large-cap tech positions in 2023 and 2024 with Nvidia and Bitcoin; the fact my firm also provided ongoing entries and risk management for these mega-winners should not be understated in terms of the value my firm has delivered.

In the January 2024 analysis, Social Media Stocks: One Metric Shows Meta’s Clear Leadership, I pointed out what separated Meta as a clear social media leader and why Snapchat would struggle with monetization. Since then, Meta shares have risen nearly 65%, while Snapchat has declined -28%. Meta was demonstrating improvements in ad pricing with strong ad impressions growth of >30% in Q2 and Q3 2023, while average revenue per user (ARPU) accelerated in those quarters; whereas Snapchat was struggling to effectively monetize its user base. Additionally, I explained that Meta was much more efficient with spending, maintaining R&D spending below 40% of gross profit while improving ARPU, significantly improving operating margin, and investing in AR/VR and AI technologies. Snapchat was “spending around 80% of its gross profit dollars on R&D,” a disproportionately high amount on R&D relative to peers while failing to increase ARPU and monetization within its user base.” I pointed out that what makes Meta a clear leader is that “it can maintain a high level of R&D spend … while remaining a cash cow with strong operating cash flow and free cash flow growth,” with OCF margin nearing 60% in Q3 2023 and OCF tracking for 50% YoY growth to $75 billion in 2023. In a follow-up analysis in March 2024, Top 3 Ad-Tech Stocks For 2024, I said that Meta’s “key metrics [were] supporting a return to >40% operating margin for the full year and a possible >33% net margin, driven by increasing ad pricing, strong engagement trends and impressions growth, aided by the release of numerous AI features.” Q3 2024’s results put this prediction very close to coming true, with 9M operating margin at 39.6% and net margin at 35.8%. In the February 2024 analysis AI Driving Acceleration For Big 3 Cloud Stocks, I discussed how AI was impacting cloud growth at Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet. For Amazon, I explained that in Q4 2023, “AWS finally accelerated in Q4 for the first time in 2 years, with Amazon reporting 13.2% growth in Q4, up just over 1 point from Q3’s 12%.” However, the more important metric was AWS’ operating leverage improving in the second half of 2023, with operating income growth at 3x the rate of revenue in Q4. At the time, AWS was generating the majority of Amazon’s company-wide operating income (67% of 2023) due to its higher operating margin (27% in Q4 2023), which I had said was “a trend that can strengthen with AI driving accelerated customer and revenue growth and decreased costs.” This has played out, with AWS reporting a 37.8% operating margin in Q3 2024. What I had seen in February 2024 was a combination of increased customer migrations, larger and longer duration contracts, increased incremental revenue QoQ, and opportunities to better monetize the suite via AI. These factors were the necessary ingredients for AWS to show “a sustained AI-driven acceleration,” even though its quarterly growth rates lagged Azure and Google Cloud. AWS growth has now re-accelerated to 19%. In a follow-up article in May, Amazon Stock: Nearing $2 Trillion Club From AWS Growth & Ads Catalyst, I provided evidence that AWS was a primary contributor to Amazon’s push to the $2 trillion milestone. I noted that AWS was contributing more than 60% of Amazon’s total operating income despite contributing less than 20% of total revenue, one reason that corporate gross profit margin has quickly approached 20% and operating margin reached double-digits for the first time ever, at 10.7%. Growth from AI quickly reached a multi-billion dollar run rate, while improvements in operating leverage at AWS aided Amazon’s bottom line and stock price — shares have risen nearly 30% since the February 2024 analysis. My firm was also early to call out a fundamental acceleration for one of 2024’s best performing AI stocks, alongside another AI-exposed ad-tech winner and an AI theme that quickly came to the forefront thanks to Nvidia. In December 2023, my firm outlined four cloud stocks set to see revenue accelerate in 2024, with Palantir one of the four. My firm had said that Palantir was “exhibiting multiple signs of acceleration heading into 2024 with an improved fundamental backdrop driven by increasing AI demand. Palantir’s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is driving a significant acceleration in its US commercial business, while underlying metrics and the bottom line are rapidly improving: Palantir posted its first GAAP profitable quarter in February and has since reported four consecutive GAAP profitable quarters.” My firm explained that “revenue growth is poised to accelerate in Q4 and through 2024, boosted by AI demand, a reacceleration in Palantir’s US government segment, and continued strength in the US commercial segment stemming from [AIP].” Palantir’s shares ended 2024 as the S&P 500’s best performer with a 341% return. In April 2024, my firm discussed Taiwan Semiconductor’s (TSMC) revenue acceleration stemming from the strength of AI/HPC revenue, with April sales surging after Q1 showed strong advanced node revenue growth and record HPC revenue. My firm discussed how TSMC was “riding the enormous wave of demand from Big Tech,” with HPC revenue rising 3% QoQ to $8.68 billion in Q1 2024, “a fresh record despite the first quarter typically being seasonally weaker.” Additionally, my firm said reports of “Nvidia and AMD fully booking out TSMC’s advanced packaging capacity through the end of 2025” lent “to a strong AI-driven outlook.” April’s sales numbers gave my firm confidence that TSMC was “on track to land in the upper half of or above the guided range” for Q2 revenue — it ultimately beat estimates by $500 million, the largest in more than two years. In June 2024, my firm published a thematic analysis on AI power consumption, and the rising power draw from next-generation GPUs. This analysis was underpinned by the “rise of generative AI and surging GPU shipments [which] is causing data centers to scale from tens of thousands to 100,000-plus accelerators, shifting the emphasis to power as a mission-critical problem to solve.” My firm explained how Nvidia’s Hopper and AMD’s MI300X accelerators consume 50% to 75% more power than the prior generation, while Blackwell represented “up to a 300% increase in power consumption across one generation of GPUs with AI systems increasing power consumption at a higher rate.” With power draw now quickly becoming mission-critical for data centers to address due to each generation of GPUs becoming increasingly more powerful than the last, my firm pointed out that this was driving a shift to liquid cooling. For 2025, my firm has worked to identify key Nvidia suppliers with Blackwell on deck to ramp significantly, sharing our in-depth research on the AI networking stack.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Growth Stocks Under $25 to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Lumen Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LUMN) stands against the other growth stocks. Most experts agree that the AI wave is not over yet. On January 8, Wendy Sheehan Donnell, Editor-in-Chief at PCMag, joined Yahoo Finance from CES 2025 to share her take on trending innovations and the increasing role of artificial intelligence in revolutionizing industries. Donnell unveiled some of the groundbreaking innovations spearheaded by companies from across the globe and emphasized that "AI is the prevailing theme" across all these new products and services. She highlighted the incidence of AI-powered home devices such as smart microwaves and fridges to help people live smarter and tech-immersed lives. She also shed light on the growing role of AI in healthcare and biotechnology, which will contribute to the well-being of people. The market close on Tuesday reiterated a similar pattern where tech stocks continued to shine, however, some analysts expect the market to broaden over the course of 2025. On January 7, Joe Mazzola, head trading and derivatives strategist at Charles Schwab, joined Yahoo Finance, to discuss his market thesis for the tech sector especially. Mazzola suggested that the market breadth was of importance in the earnings season, and pointed towards the strengthening of the US dollar and how it may impact the earnings of tech names. He added that the market needs the other "493 names" in the S&P 500 to catch up. Mazolla also emphasized that while 2025 can be a win for Big Tech like 2024, a broadening would help the overall market immensely in terms of earnings. He added that the financials sector would supposedly catalyze the broadening of the market, because of favorable economic and market conditions. He then discussed the tailwinds for financials and how the same factors serve as headwinds to Big Tech, emphasizing that the bullishness on tech has been slower than it was at the end of 2024. Our Methodology We used Finviz to look for companies operating in growth sectors such as technology, financials (fintech), biotech, and communication services. We only focused on companies with a market cap of at least $2 billion and that gained more than 50% over the past 2 quarters. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment surrounding 25 stocks and picked the 12 stocks that were the most widely held by hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Close-up of a technician's hands adjusting a communication router. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26 Share Price as of January 8, 2024: $5.55 Lumen Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LUMN) is a telecommunications company offering cloud solutions, network services, security services, and other managed services. The company offers its services to multiple leading names such as Zoom, Vikings, VSP Vision, Seattle Seahawks, BlackStar Group, and Horizon Bank. Over the past few months, the company has expanded its services and line-up by partnering with key stakeholders in the technology sector. For instance, on November 5, Lumen Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LUMN) announced a partnership with Google Cloud to speed up its digital transformation and innovation process. The partnership will allow Lumen to power AIOps and provide data insights across its network using Google Cloud. Similarly, in October, LUMN announced a partnership with Meta to help the company accelerate its AI goals. The company's partnerships and collaborations with tech giants have significantly boosted its position in the industry. In addition to that, the advent of AI has pushed the stock higher. 26 hedge funds were bullish on the stock at the end of Q3 2024. Overall LUMN ranks 8th on our list of the best growth stocks under $25 to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of LUMN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LUMN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

In the January 2024 analysis, Social Media Stocks: One Metric Shows Meta’s Clear Leadership, I pointed out what separated Meta as a clear social media leader and why Snapchat would struggle with monetization. Since then, Meta shares have risen nearly 65%, while Snapchat has declined -28%. Meta was demonstrating improvements in ad pricing with strong ad impressions growth of >30% in Q2 and Q3 2023, while average revenue per user (ARPU) accelerated in those quarters; whereas Snapchat was struggling to effectively monetize its user base. Additionally, I explained that Meta was much more efficient with spending, maintaining R&D spending below 40% of gross profit while improving ARPU, significantly improving operating margin, and investing in AR/VR and AI technologies. Snapchat was “spending around 80% of its gross profit dollars on R&D,” a disproportionately high amount on R&D relative to peers while failing to increase ARPU and monetization within its user base.” I pointed out that what makes Meta a clear leader is that “it can maintain a high level of R&D spend … while remaining a cash cow with strong operating cash flow and free cash flow growth,” with OCF margin nearing 60% in Q3 2023 and OCF tracking for 50% YoY growth to $75 billion in 2023. In a follow-up analysis in March 2024, Top 3 Ad-Tech Stocks For 2024, I said that Meta’s “key metrics [were] supporting a return to >40% operating margin for the full year and a possible >33% net margin, driven by increasing ad pricing, strong engagement trends and impressions growth, aided by the release of numerous AI features.” Q3 2024’s results put this prediction very close to coming true, with 9M operating margin at 39.6% and net margin at 35.8%. In the February 2024 analysis AI Driving Acceleration For Big 3 Cloud Stocks, I discussed how AI was impacting cloud growth at Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet. For Amazon, I explained that in Q4 2023, “AWS finally accelerated in Q4 for the first time in 2 years, with Amazon reporting 13.2% growth in Q4, up just over 1 point from Q3’s 12%.” However, the more important metric was AWS’ operating leverage improving in the second half of 2023, with operating income growth at 3x the rate of revenue in Q4. At the time, AWS was generating the majority of Amazon’s company-wide operating income (67% of 2023) due to its higher operating margin (27% in Q4 2023), which I had said was “a trend that can strengthen with AI driving accelerated customer and revenue growth and decreased costs.” This has played out, with AWS reporting a 37.8% operating margin in Q3 2024. What I had seen in February 2024 was a combination of increased customer migrations, larger and longer duration contracts, increased incremental revenue QoQ, and opportunities to better monetize the suite via AI. These factors were the necessary ingredients for AWS to show “a sustained AI-driven acceleration,” even though its quarterly growth rates lagged Azure and Google Cloud. AWS growth has now re-accelerated to 19%. In a follow-up article in May, Amazon Stock: Nearing $2 Trillion Club From AWS Growth & Ads Catalyst, I provided evidence that AWS was a primary contributor to Amazon’s push to the $2 trillion milestone. I noted that AWS was contributing more than 60% of Amazon’s total operating income despite contributing less than 20% of total revenue, one reason that corporate gross profit margin has quickly approached 20% and operating margin reached double-digits for the first time ever, at 10.7%. Growth from AI quickly reached a multi-billion dollar run rate, while improvements in operating leverage at AWS aided Amazon’s bottom line and stock price — shares have risen nearly 30% since the February 2024 analysis. My firm was also early to call out a fundamental acceleration for one of 2024’s best performing AI stocks, alongside another AI-exposed ad-tech winner and an AI theme that quickly came to the forefront thanks to Nvidia. In December 2023, my firm outlined four cloud stocks set to see revenue accelerate in 2024, with Palantir one of the four. My firm had said that Palantir was “exhibiting multiple signs of acceleration heading into 2024 with an improved fundamental backdrop driven by increasing AI demand. Palantir’s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is driving a significant acceleration in its US commercial business, while underlying metrics and the bottom line are rapidly improving: Palantir posted its first GAAP profitable quarter in February and has since reported four consecutive GAAP profitable quarters.” My firm explained that “revenue growth is poised to accelerate in Q4 and through 2024, boosted by AI demand, a reacceleration in Palantir’s US government segment, and continued strength in the US commercial segment stemming from [AIP].” Palantir’s shares ended 2024 as the S&P 500’s best performer with a 341% return. In April 2024, my firm discussed Taiwan Semiconductor’s (TSMC) revenue acceleration stemming from the strength of AI/HPC revenue, with April sales surging after Q1 showed strong advanced node revenue growth and record HPC revenue. My firm discussed how TSMC was “riding the enormous wave of demand from Big Tech,” with HPC revenue rising 3% QoQ to $8.68 billion in Q1 2024, “a fresh record despite the first quarter typically being seasonally weaker.” Additionally, my firm said reports of “Nvidia and AMD fully booking out TSMC’s advanced packaging capacity through the end of 2025” lent “to a strong AI-driven outlook.” April’s sales numbers gave my firm confidence that TSMC was “on track to land in the upper half of or above the guided range” for Q2 revenue — it ultimately beat estimates by $500 million, the largest in more than two years. In June 2024, my firm published a thematic analysis on AI power consumption, and the rising power draw from next-generation GPUs. This analysis was underpinned by the “rise of generative AI and surging GPU shipments [which] is causing data centers to scale from tens of thousands to 100,000-plus accelerators, shifting the emphasis to power as a mission-critical problem to solve.” My firm explained how Nvidia’s Hopper and AMD’s MI300X accelerators consume 50% to 75% more power than the prior generation, while Blackwell represented “up to a 300% increase in power consumption across one generation of GPUs with AI systems increasing power consumption at a higher rate.” With power draw now quickly becoming mission-critical for data centers to address due to each generation of GPUs becoming increasingly more powerful than the last, my firm pointed out that this was driving a shift to liquid cooling. For 2025, my firm has worked to identify key Nvidia suppliers with Blackwell on deck to ramp significantly, sharing our in-depth research on the AI networking stack.

Sean Pyles: Well, here we are. It's a new year. Time to take stock of how things are going with our investments. Are you thinking maybe it's time to take a bit more risk or are you looking at your portfolio and wondering if it's time to pull back? We've got some ways for you to consider all the options for investing in your financial future. Sam Taube: I do believe that people should generally build a safe and boring portfolio of index funds first and then they can speculate with whatever money they've got left over, and I'm practicing what I preach there. Sean Pyles: Welcome to NerdWallet's Smart Money podcast. I'm Sean Pyles. Sam Taube: And I'm Sam Taube. Sean Pyles: It's 2025. Do you know how your stocks are doing? Are you doing that classic new year exercise of checking the batteries in your fire detector and rebalancing your portfolio? Will you be investing some time in your investing strategy? It's a great time of year to do that, and Sam, today we've got a whole slew of tips for getting started. Sam Taube: Yes, we do, and let's say upfront what we always say at the end of the show, which is that we are not investment advisors, and this nerdy investment info is for general educational purposes only. It may not apply to your specific circumstances. That said, a lot of us touch the investing world in some way, whether it's through retirement accounts, college savings plans, or maybe a health savings account. Sean Pyles: The latest Federal Reserve survey of consumer finances showed that some 58% of US households had some sort of stock ownership as part of their finances. That was the highest number on record. The survey measured the year 2019 to 2022, so it included the COVID era and the meme stock era, for whatever that's worth. Sam Taube: For some people, that era was worth a lot. For others, not so much. That Fed survey is also borne out by another survey, this time the Economy and Personal Finance survey from Gallup. That one found that around 62% of American adults invest in stocks. That's everything from what we already mentioned—savings for retirement or college—to people holding individual stock portfolios. If you're interested in investing, well, you have a lot of company. Sean Pyles: Sam, how about you tell us exactly what's going to happen in the stock market this year so we can all make a lot of money? Sam Taube: I would be a very rich man if I could do that, but unfortunately, I can't. Sean Pyles: Bummer. Sam Taube: What we can do here is prepare for both the best and the worst, and make it so that the daily stock market gyrations don't factor that much into our overall well-being. Our goal today is to make that possible for you. Sean Pyles: Fair enough. We want to hear what you think too, listeners. What are you working on in your financial life as we start the new year? Leave us a voicemail or text the Nerd hotline at (901) 720-6373. That's 901-730-N-E-R-D, or email a voice memo to [email protected]. Sam, last week we talked with fellow Nerd and chief economist, Elizabeth Renter, about financial regrets. Let me ask you to gaze back on last year and talk about what the investing year was like, and maybe some regrets or at least lessons we might be able to take away from it. Sam Taube: It was a rip-roaring year for a lot of different kinds of investments. The S&P 500 was up over 25% year-to-date by early December, which is when we're recording this. That's an exceptionally good return compared to the long-term average of 10% per year. It was also a really big year for crypto. Bitcoin more than doubled in price last year, and certain tech stocks did even better than that. Nvidia shareholders, for example, almost tripled their money last year. If you spend enough time on social media, you find stories of people who have gotten very rich very quickly from big bets on these things over the last year. If you weren't one of those people, it's easy to get retroactive FOMO about it. Sean Pyles: Yeah, I feel that. Sam Taube: In truth, if you diversify your investments enough, you're not really missing out. As a personal example, I did not own individual shares of Nvidia at any point last year, but I did indirectly profit from Nvidia's gains because I own S&P 500 index funds, which contain Nvidia. My returns for the year were probably lower than someone who went all in on that single stock. On the other hand, that person was probably a lot more stressed about their investment than I was. Sean Pyles: Let's talk about some of the standout sectors that did especially well or especially poorly. I know you were all over the Nvidia story and came on the show a couple of times to talk about it. What were some other winners? Sam Taube: Tech in general had a pretty good year. The NASDAQ composite is actually doing even better than the S&P 500 at the time of recording in late 2024. There's still a lot of hype for certain kinds of AI and semiconductor-related companies like Taiwan Semiconductor, and as we previously mentioned, Nvidia. They've kind of carried the tech sector this year. Another sector that outperformed the market in 2024 was communications. There's a blurred line between communications and tech. For example, Meta, which was formerly known as Facebook, had a really great year, as have certain kinds of big media conglomerates like Disney and Netflix. Another big outperformer last year was the financial services sector. A lot of the big banks like Goldman Sachs and Bank of America also outperformed the market by quite a bit, and then, as we mentioned, crypto had a really great year. Sean Pyles: That's right. My Dogecoin shot up quite a bit after the election. As of this recording, it's at a whopping 38 cents, and it was often much, much lower, maybe closer to 1 cent at different points in the year. I'm really proud of the performance of my joke cryptocurrency. Sam Taube: Congrats. Sean Pyles: So, Sam, how about some loser industries in 2024? Sam Taube: The energy sector was kind of a laggard last year. It had a positive return, but less than the S&P 500. The performance of oil and gas stocks, generally speaking, is very dependent on the market price of oil, and that has actually decreased slightly over the course of 2024. You might think that poor performance in the fossil fuel industry would mean that clean energy has done well, but that has not been the case. Clean energy, particularly solar, has actually had a really rough year. The Invesco Solar ETF, which is sometimes used as a benchmark for the solar industry, was down almost 30% last year, despite the strong performance of so many other stocks. Sean Pyles: What, if anything, do these poor performers tell us about what might be coming for the markets in 2025? Sam Taube: A lot of these trends, both the winners and some of the losers, are likely related to the election. There's a theory that the stock market was anticipating that President-elect Donald Trump would win. Many of these trends may reflect expected changes in government policy or regulations that have been priced into the market over the last year. For example, the Biden administration has made some moves toward trying to break up some of the big monopolistic tech companies. Shareholders in that industry may be betting that those antitrust actions are just going to go away under Trump. Another thing that's really important for the tech industry is there's a perception that we may be getting a looser regulatory approach to AI under Trump than we might've gotten under Vice President Kamala Harris. Bank shareholders may also be anticipating looser regulations. In his first term, Trump loosened some of the banking regulations that were put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, and there's a chance he may do more of that in his second term. It's a similar deal with crypto. Markets may be just betting on less regulation in that space. Sean Pyles: Going back to the clean energy industry, do you think the dip there is also election-related? Sam Taube: There is a good case for it. The solar industry, in particular, has really benefited from tax credits under Biden, and shareholders may be predicting that those tax credits won't last. But there's an important caveat here, which is that there are a lot of assumptions in this thinking. We don't necessarily know what's going to come out of this new administration, and if these policy changes I've talked about don't happen — say the new government doesn't loosen banking regulations or it keeps the solar tax credit going — then these trends that we've been talking about might reverse somewhat. Sean Pyles: The main stock indices — S&P 500, Dow — hit new records last year over and over again. What does that mean historically? The saying is that what goes up must come down, but what do we know about how markets and investors behave in an environment of rising stock prices? Sam Taube: "What goes up must come down" is very true in physics, but in some ways, the inverse is true when we're talking about the stock market. When it comes to stock indexes like the S&P 500, it's kind of "what goes down must come up." Bear markets do happen, and they can feel really gnarly while they're happening, but they're generally followed by much longer bull markets that tend to surpass previous highs by quite a bit. Since 1932, the average S&P 500 bear market has lasted less than two years. The average bull market, on the other hand, has lasted more than four years, and we just had a bear market in 2022. History suggests that we've got a lot more upside ahead, even after a very strong 2024. Sean Pyles: At a high level, Sam, should we even pay attention when we hear news items about stocks hitting records? Sam Taube: For long-term investors, I can't really think of an immediate action anyone needs to take when we hit a new high, but it's something to keep in mind. A lot of people set up their portfolio to contain a particular mix of stocks and bonds, say 80% stocks, 20% bonds, and when we have a really strong year in the stock market, it can sometimes mess up those proportions. If stocks go up more than bonds, you might log into your retirement account or whatever after a while away and find that you now have a 90:10 stock and bond portfolio. This is why financial advisors recommend rebalancing your portfolio once or twice a year, which you mentioned at the beginning of this episode. That means selling off some of the investments that have done really well and then using the proceeds to purchase some more of the investments that have lagged so that you maintain your target mix over time. Sean Pyles: Okay. We're going to take a short break. We are back in a moment with more investing information for 2025. Stay with us. Sean Pyles: Sam, it's time to get personal. How are you approaching investing in 2025? Doing anything different, new, exciting, boring? What are you keeping your eye on? Sam Taube: I'm mostly very boring. Almost all my investments are in index funds, and I'm planning to hold them for years. For the most part, I'm just going to keep holding and adding money to them in 2025. I do also have a tiny amount of Bitcoin and Ethereum. It's spare money, and I don't have a particularly strong investment thesis for it, but one Bitcoin was worth a few hundred dollars in the early 2010s, and recently, it passed a hundred thousand dollars. I want to see what it does in the years ahead. In our line of work, people can sometimes sound a little bit scoldy when we talk about high-risk speculative investments like crypto. I don't know if it's realistic to tell people that they should never, ever touch stuff like that. I know how risky crypto is, but I'm a human being, and I'm curious about it. But I do believe that people should generally build a safe and boring portfolio of index funds first, and then they can speculate with whatever money they've got left over, and I'm practicing what I preach there. Sean Pyles: I think that's good advice. You cover your fundamentals first, make sure that you are saving and investing for retirement, and then if you have some leftover cash, maybe dabble a bit in other areas. But I think if people are putting all of their money into crypto for retirement, that's a very risky, potentially dangerous idea. Sam Taube: Exactly. Very well said. Sean Pyles: Let's talk about how to get into investing if it's something that you're not already immersed in but maybe want to experiment with, especially outside of retirement and other savings funds. With the caveat once again that we are not investment advisors, what's a good way to dip a toe into the stock market waters—or maybe the bond waters if that's your thing? Sam Taube: The first step is going to be to open an investment account if you don't have one. NerdWallet has some really helpful roundups of the best brokerage accounts if you don't know where to look. Once you have an account, you need to put some money in, and then you also need to invest that money. I've mentioned index funds a couple of times already. For listeners who don't know, these are baskets of stocks that mirror the performance of a stock market index like the S&P 500. They're really good for beginners. The nice thing about S&P 500 index funds and most other index funds is that they give you exposure to dozens or hundreds of stocks in a single purchase. They're pretty low maintenance. You don't really have to research the individual stocks or worry about whether or not they're doing better or worse than the overall market because index funds just give you the overall market's return. Sean Pyles: And what are some red flags to keep an eye out for if you are new to the investing world? Sam Taube: There's a lot of bad faith and scammy information out there, and I think a big red flag is any kind of promised return. If you come across some crypto product or investment guru or something who promises that they can double your money in a year, that's probably a scam. A milder red flag is if someone or something is bragging about its past returns. If you go on TikTok, you can find these stock-picking gurus who advertise themselves by bragging about the big 500% score they made on Nvidia options last year or whatever the case may be. The thing is, even if that claim is legitimate, past performance doesn't guarantee future performance. It's still good to be skeptical of any kind of influencer or financial product that advertises itself that way. There's a common thread here, which is to be aware of things that sound like get-rich-quick schemes. If it seems too good to be true, there's a good chance that it is. Sean Pyles: Sam, what are some ways to figure out which investing platform is best for you? There are so many apps and websites out there. What advice do you have for picking one over another? What factors should people be considering? Sam Taube: The best investing platform for a particular person is going to depend on their goals and also on their skill level. Again, I'm going to plug NerdWallet's roundups here because we have a whole bunch of them that cater to different kinds of needs. If you're looking for a retirement account, we have a roundup of the best IRAs. If you're really new to investing, we have a roundup of the best brokerage accounts for beginners. If you're more experienced and you're looking to trade options, we have a roundup of the best brokerage accounts for options, too. On each of these roundups, we have a really easy-to-read table that lists each broker's fees, account minimums, active promotions, and our NerdWallet rating, and also detailed pros and cons lists for each one. We want to make it easy for you to do all your comparison shopping in one place. Of course, we'll include a link to those in today's show notes. Sean Pyles: Sam, I wonder if you could talk a bit about the relative importance of stock markets in our financial lives. There's a common saying that the stock market is not the economy, right? Yes, it's a large part of the financial world, but would you agree that it's not the end-all, be-all? When we hear news headlines about the stock market, we need to understand that there are other aspects of the economy that are just as important. Sam Taube: Absolutely. For that matter, if you're really just starting out from square one financially, investing probably isn't even going to be your top priority, and ditto if you're trying to recover from some kind of setback or get out of debt. Many advisors would say that building up an emergency fund and paying down high-interest debts like credit card debt are good things to tackle before you even start thinking about long-term savings and investments. Sean Pyles: Very sound advice. Sam Taube, thank you so much for helping us out today. Sam Taube: Always great to be here. Sean Pyles: And be sure to join us next week as we continue to look at your money in 2025. We're going to hear all about budgeting and how to manage your credit life. Kim Palmer: The main caution to watch out for with credit cards is overspending. Credit cards can just be really tricky because it doesn't necessarily feel like real money, and other than the credit limit on the card, there's really nothing stopping us to keep swiping away to buy what we want. Sam Taube: For now, that's all we have for this episode. Do you have a money question of your own? Turn to the Nerds and call or text us your questions at (901) 730-6373. That's (901) 730-NERD.

Title: What’s Happening With eBay Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/01/09/whats-happening-with-ebay-stock/
Time Published: 2025-01-09T14:24:22Z
Full Content:
POLAND - 2024/12/17: In this photo illustration, the eBay company logo is seen displayed on a ... [+] smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Piotr Swat/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) The stock price of eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) saw a 10% jump on Wednesday, January 8, after Meta announced that it would allow certain eBay listings to appear on Facebook Marketplace. A collaboration with Meta might strengthen eBay’s competitive standing in the e-commerce landscape. eBay has been struggling with falling gross merchandise volume, which fell from$87.4 billion in 2021 to $73.2 billion in 2023, due to a challenging macroeconomic environment. Higher inflation and weak consumer sentiment have weighed on the company’s top-line growth. However, the company has seen a slight recovery in 2024. The recent move from Meta will help eBay improve its GMV, given the solid traffic Facebook sees. For Meta, this move comes after the European Commission imposed a penalty over alleged anticompetitive practices in its online classifieds business. eBay stock has had a good past year – thanks to the recovery in GMV. It was up 45% in 2024, outperforming the broader S&P 500 index, up 23%. Looking at a slightly longer period, eBay has seen its stock rise 75% from levels of $40 in early 2023 to $63 now. This can be attributed to: eBay’s revenue growth lately has been driven by growth in its focus categories, which includes auto parts and accessories, collectibles, handbags, refurbished goods, and luxury fashion. This has helped it see higher GMV and take rate over the recent quarters. The company has been targeting AI to bolster its sales by offering personalized recommendations. Its focus on certain categories, such as auto parts and accessories, seems to be working well for the company. Still, eBay faces tough competition from the likes of Amazon, Walmart, Etsy, and Temu, among others. Separately, look at What’s Happening With RGTI Stock? Looking at the company’s profitability, its operating margin declined from 24% in 2022 to 21.3% now. Given the fall in revenue and operating margin, eBay’s adjusted net income declined from $2.7 billion in 2022 to $2.4 billion now. However, its share repurchases helped the bottom line expand from $4.02 to $4.69 over this period. Although EBAY has outperformed the broader markets lately, the increase in EBAY stock over the recent years has been far from consistent, with annual returns being more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 34% in 2021, -36% in 2022, 8% in 2023, and 45% in 2024. While EBAY stock has seen mixed growth over recent years, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark S&P 500 index over the last four year period; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and weak consumer sentiment, could EBAY face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? From a valuation perspective, we think it’s fully valued. We estimate eBay valuation to be $60 per share, 13% below the current market price of $69. At its current levels, EBAY stock is already trading at over 13x its forward expected earnings of $5.21 per share in 2025. This compares with the stock’s average P/E ratio of 11x over the last five years. While EBAY stock looks like it is fully valued, it is helpful to see how eBay’s peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: Refining fine-mapping: Effect sizes and regional heritability
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1011480
Time Published: 2025-01-09T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
Recent statistical approaches have shown that the set of all available genetic variants explains considerably more phenotypic variance of complex traits and diseases than the individual variants that are robustly associated with these phenotypes. However, rapidly increasing sample sizes constantly improve detection and prioritization of individual variants driving the associations between genomic regions and phenotypes. Therefore, it is useful to routinely estimate how much phenotypic variance the detected variants explain for each region by taking into account the correlation structure of variants and the uncertainty in their causal status. Here we extend the FINEMAP software to estimate the effect sizes and regional heritability under the probabilistic model that assumes a handful of causal variants per region. Using the UK Biobank (UKB) data to simulate genomic regions, we demonstrate that FINEMAP provides higher precision and enables more detailed decomposition of regional heritability into individual variants than the variance component model implemented in BOLT or the fixed-effect model implemented in HESS, particularly when there are only a few causal variants in the fine-mapped region. Using data from 2,940 plasma proteins from the UKB study, we observed that on average FINEMAP identified 2.5 causal variants at an association signal and captured 36% more regional heritability than the variant with the lowest P-value. We estimate that in genomic regions with notable contribution to the total heritability, FINEMAP captures on average 13% and 40% more heritability than BOLT and HESS respectively. Our analysis shows how FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS relate to each other in cases where inference of a variant-level picture of the regional genetic architecture is possible. Advancements in statistical methodologies to analyze Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have revealed that numerous genetic variants across the whole genome significantly contribute to the phenotypic variation in quantitative traits and disease risk. As sample sizes in GWAS grow, there is a continuous improvement in identifying and prioritizing individual variants that drive associations between genomic regions and phenotypes. To better understand both the individual and joint contribution of these variants to phenotypic variation, we extend the FINEMAP software to simultaneously estimate effect sizes of individual variants and heritability of genomic regions. Using simulations, we study how regional heritability estimates of FINEMAP and existing heritability approaches relate to each other and when a fine-mapping model is able to accurately narrow down the regional heritability into contributions from individual variants. In the analysis of plasma biomarkers, we demonstrate that FINEMAP offers more precise regional heritability estimates than existing heritability approaches in genomic regions that contribute notably to the total heritability. These new features in FINEMAP enable routine comparisons between the regional heritability estimates originating from different modeling assumptions, and inform us about the genetic architecture of each genomic region.

Over the last decade, GWAS have accumulated a massive catalog of robust statistical associations between numerous genomic regions and complex traits or diseases [1]. Typically, genetic variants highlighted by GWAS explain only a small fraction of total phenotypic variation (the missing heritability problem [2]) and are clustered into clumps of even hundreds of highly correlated variants giving rise to the fine-mapping problem [3]. The missing heritability problem has spurred highly successful methodological research in variance components models to evaluate the heritability contribution from the whole genome, not just from the statistically significantly associated variants [4–6]. Software packages implementing variance component models include EMMAX [7], GCTA [8], GEMMA [9], MMM [10] and BOLT [5]. Common to these implementations is the requirement of individual-level genotype-phenotype data and the assumption that the phenotype has a polygenic architecture under which all variants are causal with tiny effects. Heritability estimation using a polygenic model has also been carried out with LD Score regression [6] and a polygenic score method AVENGEME [11] from GWAS summary statistics without access to the original genotype-phenotype data. Together these methods have considerably narrowed the gap between estimated SNP heritability and heritability estimates from twin studies for many phenotypes and, importantly, shed light on the genetic architecture and enrichment of functional genetic variation in complex traits and diseases [12–13]. With increasing statistical power of GWAS comes a possibility to narrow the heritability down into specific regions of the genome. Heritability estimation in genomic regions from GWAS summary statistics was introduced in the software package HESS [14] under the assumption of arbitrary genetic architecture and a fixed-effect model for causal effect sizes. HESS estimates heritability through a regularized quadratic form built on marginal effect size estimates of all variants and their pairwise correlations to account for Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) between them. HESS was shown to be more accurate than LD Score regression in regional heritability estimation on simulated data when both methods were run with pairwise correlations either from the original genotype data or a reference panel. Although polygenic and fixed-effect models have been very useful approaches for the estimation of genome-wide or regional heritability, the model assumptions of polygenicity or arbitrary genetic architecture likely leave room for improvement in accuracy if regional heritability can be attributed to only a few causal variants. Furthermore, our ultimate goal is to pinpoint the individual variants contributing to heritability and obtain accurate effect size estimates for them. Because existing heritability estimation methods do not provide such information, we turn to the fine-mapping framework instead. The decisive solution to the fine-mapping problem is often hindered by the lack of information due to small effect sizes, high LD between variants and imperfect genotype information. Therefore, many recent fine-mapping methods [15–19] implement principled probabilistic quantification of causal variants that can then be used for downstream analyses. As GWAS sample sizes are soon counted in millions providing unprecedented accuracy for statistical fine-mapping, it would be useful to routinely evaluate how much of the regional heritability can be explained by the fine-mapped variants. In particular, we may expect that fine-mapping captures a large part of the regional heritability in 1) molecular endophenotypes with moderate to large effect sizes at causal variants, and 2) in large-scale biobank projects and ongoing GWAS meta-analyses with adequate statistical power to detect most individual causal variants even with smaller effect sizes. On the other hand, fine-mapping is likely not informative in regions with only tiny effect sizes or in GWAS with very small sample sizes. In cases where the fine-mapping seems to explain the total regional heritability, we have a much more informative picture of the regional architecture than is given by the existing heritability estimation methods that do not identify individual causal variants. Therefore, we have extended the FINEMAP software [18] to provide estimates of effect sizes and regional heritability. Our previously published FINEMAP algorithm (version 1.1) [18] worked only with small causal effect sizes and did not provide estimates of effect sizes or regional heritability. Here we introduce FINEMAP version 1.4 that estimates causal effects of arbitrary magnitude and estimates regional heritability by accounting for the uncertainty of the causal configuration and the LD-adjusted joint effect sizes of causal variants. We compare regional heritability estimation using FINEMAP with both the variance component model implemented in BOLT and the fixed-effect model implemented in HESS. Ideally, with such comparisons, we can evaluate how much of the total regional heritability we capture with fine-mapped variants. Previously, Gusev et al. [20] have studied how the variance explained by the variant with the lowest P-value of a GWAS region compares to the results of a variance component model applied to the same region. They reported that on average the variance component model explained 1.29 times more heritability over nine diseases. We use plasma level concentrations of 2,940 unique proteins from the UKB, with a broad spectrum of genome-wide heritability levels. As an example where both FINEMAP and BOLT give a similar estimate of about 41% regional heritability, we study in detail the association between the PON1 gene and Paraoxonase 1 levels. To interpret the results from our protein data analysis more generally, we also perform a simulation study to evaluate FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS under different genetic architectures. As our ultimate goal is to narrow down the polygenic regional heritability into individual variants, it is useful to know how the heritability estimates of FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS relate to each other in cases where such decomposition is indeed possible. More generally, an ability to do routine comparisons between the regional heritability estimates originating from different modeling assumptions, including a fine-mapping model, further informs us about the genetic architecture of each region. We start with a motivating example of a region with a large contribution to the total heritability. Next, we study by simulation how a fine-mapping method FINEMAP, a variance component model BOLT and a fixed-effect heritability estimation model HESS perform more generally. Finally, we apply the methods to estimate the regional heritability of Protein Quantitative Trait Loci (pQTLs). Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is a protein encoded by the PON1 gene on chromosome 7. Serum levels of PON1 have been reported to be reversely associated with systemic oxidative stress and atherosclerosis risk [21]. The strongest genetic associations with the serum level of PON1 were indeed located near the PON1 gene, which agrees with an earlier GWAS [21]. We applied FINEMAP on a 5.9Mb genomic region around the PON1 gene with 1,095 variants. FINEMAP estimated that with over 95% probability 16 variants are needed to explain the association signal and the fine-mapped variants together explain a heritability of h2 = 0.42 (CI0.95: 0.40–0.43) which is considerably more than the lead variant rs854560 alone (h2 = 0.21, CI0.95: 0.20–0.22). The top configuration from FINEMAP included 16 variants which were compared to the top 16 variants identified by the stepwise conditioning (S1 Table). The log-likelihood difference was 48.2 in favor of the configuration identified by FINEMAP demonstrating the efficiency of the search algorithm of FINEMAP compared to the stepwise conditional analysis. BOLT estimated regional h2 = 0.41 (CI0.95: 0.39–0.44) which was similar to the estimate from FINEMAP but with a wider confidence interval. HESS with the default regularization gave an unexpectedly small value h2 = 0.33 (CI0.95: 0.32–0.34), that was larger than the marginal heritability contribution of the lead variant alone but clearly smaller than FINEMAP and BOLT. HESS without regularization of the LD matrix yielded a value h2 = 0.53 (CI0.95: 0.52–0.54) that was much larger than the values from FINEMAP and BOLT. As a conclusion, the PON1 cis-pQTL is an example of a large effect region where FINEMAP provides fine-mapping that is statistically preferred over both the stepwise conditioning and single-variant analysis, and produces heritability estimates that are more detailed and more precise than the results from BOLT or HESS. However, paraoxonase 1 levels are an extreme case with a very large regional heritability contribution from the cis-pQTL and low polygenicity for the levels of PON1 outside of the PON1 locus (BOLT h2 = 0.06, CI0.95: 0.02–0.10). Therefore, we next performed simulation studies to assess more generally the performance of FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS under different genetic architectures. Using datasets on 100 GWAS regions, we evaluated heritability estimation implemented in FINEMAP, HESS and BOLT in simulations with three randomly chosen causal variants. This setting of a very sparse genetic architecture is particularly suitable for FINEMAP and we are interested in how BOLT and HESS perform relative to FINEMAP in order to later interpret results from our protein data analysis. The FINEMAP results verified our implementation as the estimates were nearly unbiased and the precision increased with the sample size (Fig 1 and S2A Table). When the sample size was small or the heritability was low, FINEMAP tended to underestimate the heritability but this effect disappeared with increasing sample size. This phenomenon shows how our prior distributions favor sparse models and smaller effect sizes in cases where the information in the data is weak, but how the effect of the priors diminishes with more informative data. However, when the heritability is tiny and the data are uninformative (n = 5,000, h2 = 0.025%), FINEMAP can also overestimate the heritability (Fig 1A and S2A Table). BOLT was downwardly biased for the larger heritabilities but upwardly biased for the smaller heritabilities (Fig 1 and S2A Table). The downward bias for the large heritabilities may result from a clear violation of the polygenic model whereas the upward bias for the small heritabilities may exist because BOLT constrains the REML-estimates to reside in the interval [0,1] and hence can overestimate heritability values close to zero. Root mean square error (RMSE) of BOLT improved with increasing sample size except for a heritability value of 5%. Compared to FINEMAP, BOLT had larger RMSE (S2B Table). This suggests that the polygenic assumption of BOLT leads to less accurate estimates compared to FINEMAP in cases where heritability can be attributed to a few causal variants. Genotype data from UKB over 100 GWAS regions were used for phenotype generation. Three GWAS sample sizes (n) and four heritability values (h2) were considered and for each combination of region, sample size and heritability, 10 datasets were generated per GWAS region. Each dataset included three causal variants with joint effect sizes chosen so that the three variants together account for the regional heritability in proportions of 61.8%, 25.8% and 12.4%. For each of the three estimation methods, we show the boxplots of point estimates over the datasets. The horizontal lines mark the true value of heritability.

This may indicate that the regularization method applied by HESS can cause considerable underestimation of heritability in regions with only a few causal variants. We observed that HESS without regularization was upwardly biased across the sample sizes. The RMSE values from HESS were always larger than those from FINEMAP and, in most cases, also larger than those from BOLT (S2B Table). To assess the calibration of uncertainty estimates of h2, we study the coverage of 95% credible and confidence intervals defined as the proportion of intervals that covered the true level of heritability (S2B Table). For FINEMAP, the coverage was always at least 86% while for some of the 95% intervals of BOLT the coverage dropped below 10%. For all sample sizes, the 95% intervals from HESS with and without regularization were clearly miscalibrated for the larger heritabilities because of the systematic bias in heritability estimates. S2B Table also shows the ratio between the average standard error (BOLT and HESS) or average posterior standard deviation (FINEMAP) and the standard deviation of the heritability estimates of the respective method. If the estimated standard error or posterior standard deviation was frequentistically well calibrated, we would expect this ratio to be close to one. We see that for FINEMAP and HESS without regularization, in most scenarios, the ratio is in the range of 0.8–1.2 showing a reasonably good frequentist calibration. For BOLT and HESS with regularization the ratio is systematically above one and often clearly above 1.2, which indicates a worse frequentist calibration of the standard error estimates. S1A Fig shows a comparison of marginal posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs) between FINEMAP and CAVIARBF across datasets with three causal variants. The strategies for handling large effect regions yield similar PIPs for both methods, but we note that CAVIARBF does not produce estimates of effect sizes or regional heritability. S1B Fig shows a comparison of PIPs from FINEMAP using different strategies to model large effect regions. FINEMAP v1.4 performs well in all settings whereas we observe many false positives when large effects are not appropriately accounted for in the previously published FINEMAP v1.1. This is because when we incorrectly assume that all effects are small, the only way to explain large regional heritability is by stipulating that also many non-causal variants contribute to the heritability. We also evaluated FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS in simulations with fifty randomly chosen causal variants using the 100 GWAS regions. This setting is less suitable for FINEMAP than the previous setting with three causal variants because individual causal variants now explain much less heritability. However, as large biobank data can provide adequate statistical power to detect many individual causal variants even with small effect sizes, these results are useful when we interpret the results from our protein data analysis. FINEMAP was downwardly biased for the smallest h2 of 0.025% and 0.15% (Fig 2A–2C) for all sample sizes except for the smallest sample size n = 5,000 when h2 was 0.025% (Fig 2A). For larger h2 of 5% and 50%, FINEMAP underestimated the heritability when n = 5,000 but this effect diminished with increasing sample size. These results show how the fine-mapping priors, that favor sparse causal models, tend to underestimate the heritability when the heritability is scattered across numerous tiny effects but this underestimation decreases when both the effect sizes and the sample sizes increase. BOLT was weakly upwardly biased for the smallest h2 of 0.025% and 0.15% except when h2 was 0.15% and n = 300,000 (Fig 2A–2C). For larger heritabilities, BOLT provided downwardly biased heritability estimates (Fig 2D–2F). Heritability estimates from HESS in simulations with fifty causal variants were similar to results in simulations with three causal variants (S2A, S2B, S3A and S3B Tables). Genotype data from UKB over 100 GWAS regions were used for phenotype generation. Three GWAS sample sizes (n) and four regional heritability values (h2) were considered and for each combination of region, sample size and heritability, 10 datasets were generated per GWAS region. Each dataset included 50 causal variants with equal effect size. For each of the three estimation methods, we show the boxplots of point estimates over the datasets. The horizontal lines mark the true value of heritability. Genotype data from UKB over 100 GWAS regions were used for phenotype generation.

The coverage of BOLT was always above 72%, except at h2 of 0.025% when n = 5,000 and at h2 of 50% when n = 300,000 the coverage dropped below 60%. For all sample sizes, the 95% intervals from HESS with and without regularization were clearly miscalibrated for the larger heritabilities because of the systematic bias in heritability estimates. For FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS with regularization the ratio between the average standard error (BOLT and HESS) or average posterior standard deviation (FINEMAP) and the standard deviation of the heritability estimates of the respective method was systematically above one and often clearly above 1.2, which indicates a worse frequentist calibration of the standard error estimates. For HESS without regularization the ratio is in the range of 0.8–1.0 showing a reasonably good frequentist calibration. We observed that as heritability and sample size increase, the expected number of causal variants estimated by FINEMAP becomes a reliable statistic to inform us about whether the genetic architecture in the region is sparse or polygenic. In S2 Fig we see that this statistic makes a clear distinction between the sparse and polygenic architectures starting from the setting when h2 = 0.15% and n = 300,000. GWAS of 2,490 unique proteins identified 14,189 genome-wide significant pQTL regions. Using BOLT, we estimated an average polygenic component of heritability from outside the pQTL regions of 0.11 per protein ranging from 0.00 (Transgelin-3, UniProt: Q9UI15) to 0.37 (Cystatin-M, UniProt: Q15828), whereas in 23% of the proteins causal variants in pQTLs estimated by FINEMAP explained more protein level variation than the polygenic component (Fig 3) and on average 36% more regional heritability than the lead variant alone (Fig 4A). FINEMAP analyses further showed that the posterior expected number of causal variants is 2.5 on average, ranging from 1 (Uromodulin, UniProt: P07911) to 30 (Amnionless, UniProt: Q9BXJ7), and that the minor allele frequency (MAF) of causal variants is 0.24 on average, ranging from 0.02 (ADAMTS-like protein 4, UniProt: Q6UY14) to 0.47 (Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5, UniProt: P06731). The region-specific results are given in S4 Table. Each circle represents the point estimate of heritability (h2) for the pQTL component (sum of variance explained across all pQTLs) vs. the polygenic component (genome-wide heritability excluding regions defined by pQTLs ±5Mb). Heritability was estimated with FINEMAP and BOLT using up to 28,008 unrelated individuals of European ancestry from UKB and genotyped biallelic variants with MAF greater than 1%.

When FINEMAP estimated regional heritability above h2 = 0.01 (2,302 / 14,189 regions), we observed 6.28 (CI0.95: 1.24–18.70) causal variants on average and the heritability estimates from FINEMAP were on average 13% larger than BOLT and 40% larger than HESS with default regularization (Fig 4B and 4C). This suggests that the regional genetic architecture of these pQTLs is not highly polygenic. For the regions where FINEMAP estimated a heritability level below 0.0l, the estimates from FINEMAP were on average 14% lower than BOLT and HESS with default regularization (Fig 5B and 5C). Compared to FINEMAP, the heritability estimates from HESS without regularization (Figs 4D and 5D) were 57% larger on average.

When the heritability captured by FINEMAP was more than h2 = 0.01, BOLT and HESS with default regularization provided respectively 83% and 20% wider 95% confidence intervals on average compared to FINEMAP. HESS without regularization provided 95% confidence intervals that were 162% wider on average compared to 95% credible intervals from FINEMAP. Large biobanks with hundreds of thousands of samples are boosting our ability to fine-map genomic regions, that is, to probabilistically quantify which of the many correlated genetic variants have a putative causal effect on complex traits and diseases. As the power to identify causal variants and the precision of their effect size estimates increases, it is useful to be able to routinely evaluate how much of the phenotypic variance these causal variants explain together and how that compares to regional heritability estimates from models with different assumptions about the genetic architecture. To our knowledge, an estimate of the regional heritability of the fine-mapped variants is not given by the existing probabilistic fine-mapping methods. In this work, we extended the FINEMAP software to output estimates of effect sizes and regional heritability by taking into account the LD structure among the variants and the posterior probability of each putative causal configuration of variants. We performed simulations to verify our implementation and to assess how existing heritability estimation methods BOLT and HESS work in the case where a genomic region truly contains only a few causal variants. Previously, BOLT and HESS have been tested under highly polygenic architectures and here we assessed how they perform when there is considerable regional heritability but its source is not polygenic. We see this as an important piece of information since our goal is to interpret what the possible differences in the regional heritability estimates from FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS reveal about the genetic architecture of the region. We also considered highly polygenic settings where genetic effects would be distributed among numerous variants with tiny effects. In such settings, we expect that reduced statistical power to detect individual causal variants makes fine-mapping difficult and consequently also keeps the regional heritability estimate of FINEMAP low, which was confirmed by our results. Based on previous analyses [14], we expected that some existing methods, such as BOLT and HESS, could still provide reasonable heritability in such highly polygenic regions. Our simulation results show that FINEMAP is nearly unbiased for larger sample sizes and provides accurate uncertainty quantification of the regional heritability estimates when there are only a few causal variants in the region. With BOLT, there was an upward bias for the smallest heritability values possibly because BOLT constrains the REML-estimates to be positive. BOLT overestimated the standard error and had wider confidence intervals compared to FINEMAP, likely due to the simulation setup which differed from the polygenic modeling assumptions of BOLT and was similar to the FINEMAP model. In simulations with 50 causal variants per region, we observed that FINEMAP underestimated the heritability, especially when both the regional heritability and the sample size were small. This is expected since the fine-mapping model assumes sparse genetic architecture, and therefore is not expected to perform well when there are as many as 50 causal variants with small effects. In this setting, BOLT typically provided smaller mean square error and better calibration of 95% intervals than FINEMAP. We also observed that the default regularization method applied by HESS induces a systematic downward bias and low precision in the estimates. The default regularization corresponds to using only the first 50 principal components of the correlation structure of the variants to remove noise present in the trailing components, especially when the LD structure does not match the GWAS summary statistics. A possible explanation for the downward bias is that the weight of the variants contributing to heritability may be weak on the leading principal components and therefore using the default settings in HESS misses important information. In our simulations, we had a perfect match between the LD structure and GWAS summary statistics and we observed that by deactivating the regularization method we could remove the bias for the smallest heritability levels. However, this could not solve the problem for the largest heritability level and led to larger confidence intervals that increased with GWAS sample size. In the protein data analysis, we also observed that deactivating regularization of HESS does not always work even when we have access to the original LD structure. Based on our simulations, our expectation in the analysis of protein data was that the FINEMAP heritability estimates would be bounded from below by the contribution from the variant with the lowest P-value alone and from above by polygenic and fixed-effect models, such as BOLT and HESS, that conceptually consider all variants causal. We indeed observed such a pattern with FINEMAP explaining 36% more regional heritability on average than the variant with the lowest P-value alone. The regional heritability estimates from BOLT tended to be lower than the values from FINEMAP in 58% of pQTLs (977 / 2,302 regions) in which FINEMAP estimated a heritability greater than 0.01 (2,302 / 14,182 regions). A possible explanation is that these pQTLs may contain a heritability contribution that is not highly polygenic and fine-mapping accurately captures it with our sample size of 28,008 individuals. In 78% of pQTLs (9,313 / 11,880 regions) in which regional heritability estimates from FINEMAP were less than 0.01 (11,880 / 14,182 regions), BOLT regional heritability estimates were larger compared to FINEMAP. Similar to our simulations, a part of the higher point estimates of BOLT may result from BOLT constraining the REML-estimates to reside in the interval [0,1] and hence overestimating heritability values close to zero and/or FINEMAP not capturing the lower heritability levels in these pQTLs. The estimates from HESS with default regularization were on average 5% larger compared to FINEMAP. Deactivation of the regularization method of HESS increased the HESS estimates so that they became 57% larger than the values from FINEMAP. A possible explanation is the presence of (nearly) perfectly correlated variants in the pQTL regions making the correlation matrices not invertible or unstable in genomic regions with (nearly) perfectly correlated variants. An ultimate goal in genetics research is to narrow down the polygenic regional heritability into individual variants contributing to heritability and to obtain accurate effect sizes for them. The extensions for effect size and heritability estimation that we have introduced in the FINEMAP software provide a computationally efficient framework to deduce a variant-level picture of the regional genetic architecture. We expect that these new features prove useful as the accuracy of fine-mapping constantly increases with rapidly growing sample size of biobank-scale studies. We used data from the UKB [22] using the Application number 44257. Ethics approval for the UKB study was obtained from the North West Centre for Research Ethics Committee (11/ NW/0382). Proteomic profiling of the UKB was approved by the Access Subcommittee of UKB, under Access Management System Application No. 65851. All participants of the UKB provided written informed consent. The goal of statistical fine-mapping is to refine a large set of genetic variants simply associated with a phenotype down to a much smaller set of variants with direct effect on the phenotype by accounting for the complex correlations between the variants. Although we call the variants with such direct effects “causal”, we bear in mind that further laboratory experiments would be required to establish the exact biological mechanisms of those variants. The statistical framework in FINEMAP (see Web Resources) to infer causal variants is built on Bayesian variable selection for linear regression models [23] using Bayes factors. Previously [18], we derived the Bayes factor to assess the support for each combination of k variants denoted by γ, and hereafter called causal configuration, over the null configuration. Our previous derivation18 implemented in FINEMAP v.1.1, started with a likelihood approximation for the joint linear regression model for all variants in the region and assumed small enough effect sizes that we could ignore the differences in residual variance between causal configurations. In the following, we derive a corresponding Bayes factor by using a likelihood approximation of only the causal variants, which makes the effect size estimation feasible, and by allowing different residual variances for different configurations. For this, we assume the following Bayesian linear regression model for the causal configuration γ, (1) where y is a standardized vector with phenotypic values for n individuals (with is a matrix of dimension n×k with standardized genotypes at the variants, λγ are the additive effect sizes of the standardized variants, is the user-given prior variance for the effect sizes and is the point estimate of the residual variance in the multiple linear regression that we learn from the data (details below). Integrating out effect sizes λγ analytically yields the marginal likelihood of the causal configuration where we reduced computational complexity by applying the Matrix determinant lemma and Woodbury matrix identity on line 2. The computational complexity of evaluating the marginal likelihood can be further reduced substantially by replacing the phenotype-genotype data with GWAS summary statistics and pairwise correlations between variants [15–19]. That is, we replace individual-level data (y,X) with GWAS summary data in which case where is a vector of ratios of effect size estimates and their standard errors from individual univariate linear regressions of each variant in the causal configuration, is a matrix of pairwise sample correlations among the variants and is a diagonal matrix of estimates for residual variances in the univariate linear regressions. Thus, we can compute the Bayes factor to assess the support for a causal configuration γ over the null configuration γ0, that contains no variants, by using only GWAS summary data on variants included in the causal configuration γ Numerically, this Bayes factor agrees with our earlier derivation [18] when causal variants have small effect sizes and hence . With the current derivation of the Bayes factor, we can also account for causal variants with larger effect sizes by allowing for different residual variances for different configurations and we provide a simple way to extract the posterior distribution of the effect sizes as explained next. The posterior distribution of the effect sizes of variants included in a causal configuration is where and . An estimate of the heritability of a causal configuration γ is given by the ratio between the variance explained by the causal variants and the total variance of the phenotype, which we here compute conditional on the effect sizes λγ as (2) where the empirical estimate from the data equals zero because of centered genotypes. Hence our point estimate is and we compute the posterior distribution of by evaluating Eq (2) for each draw from the posterior for λγ. This approach allows us to obtain the mean, standard deviation and 95% credible interval (equal tail area interval) of the posterior. We expect high quality posterior inference if is a good approximation to the pairwise sample correlations computed from the original GWAS genotype data [24]. For quantitative traits, setting the estimates for residual variances in equal to one is a good approximation in genomic regions with small causal effects and FINEMAP v1.1 uses this approximation. However, this approach can lead to problems when causal variants have larger effect sizes [25]. Since FINEMAP v1.2, we account for different magnitudes of effect sizes by calculating, for each variant ℓ, the maximum likelihood estimate for the residual variance in univariate linear regression. If all variants individually account for less than heritability of 1%, we keep in Eq (1) fixed at a value of 1.0 and set the prior variance for the effect size equal to 0.052; this means that a causal variant contributes less than heritability of 1% with probability 0.95 [18]. Otherwise, we expect to see larger effect sizes. In this case, we set in Eq (1) equal to the maximum likelihood estimate for the residual variance from multiple linear regression of variants in the causal configuration γ. For each causal configuration, we further use an equidistant grid of four values for the prior variance with a lower bound at 0.052 and an upper bound where, with probability 0.95, a causal variant contributes less than the point estimate of heritability of a causal configuration γ of the variants with pairwise absolute correlations less than 0.95 that are marginally the most significant and that each contribute more than heritability of 1%. For each grid value, we compute the Bayes factor for assessing the evidence against the null configuration. We obtain the final Bayes factor by computing the average value of the individual Bayes factors. This model averaging corresponds to a uniform prior distribution on over the grid points. Our strategy for adapting to large effect sizes requires no actions from the user and therefore differs from the approach [25] of CAVIARBF v0.2.1 (see Web Resources) which requires user-given values for the prior standard deviation sλ. We compare FINEMAP v1.4 with CAVIARBF and FINEMAP v1.1 on simulated datasets with three causal variants among 150 variants in a genomic region (see “Simulations with GWAS regions”). Each dataset was analyzed with FINEMAP and CAVIARBF using default values and allowing for a maximum of four causal variants in the region. For CAVIARBF, we excluded the null configuration from the output and used multiple values 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 to specify the prior standard deviation sλ as recommended [25]. The Bayesian variable selection approach to fine-mapping causal variants is a hard combinatorial problem which precludes exhaustive enumeration of all possible causal configurations. In previous work [18], we tackled the combinatorial problem with Shotgun Stochastic Search [26] algorithm to identify a list of causal configurations which captures a large majority of the total posterior probability [18]. According to the Bayesian paradigm, we account for model uncertainty through Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) [27]. BMA combines inference about a quantity common to all models by averaging the posterior distribution of that quantity under each model using posterior model probabilities as weights. Using BMA, we compute the PIP for the ℓth variant by summing up the posterior probability of all causal configurations in which this variant is included. We model-average estimates of heritability to quantify the contribution of causal variants. Examples of other useful model-averaged estimates are the posterior effect size mean and standard deviation of the ℓth variant. We output marginalized shrinkage estimates of the posterior effect size mean and standard deviation by averaging over all causal configurations assuming that the effect size of the ℓth variant is zero if the variant is absent from a causal configuration. We also output the conditional estimates of the posterior effect size mean and standard deviation conditional on inclusion by averaging over only those causal configurations in which the ℓth variant is included. The magnitude of the conditional model-averaged estimate of the ℓth variant is much larger than the shrinkage model-averaged estimate if the PIP for the ℓth variant is small. Variance component models are extensively used for heritability estimation under a polygenic model assumption. We performed regional heritability estimation from individual-level genotype-phenotype data with BOLT v2.3 (see Web Resources) using default settings. In genome-wide analyses, we used an LD pruned set of variants (—indep-pairwise 1000 100 0.8, see Web Resources) while in regional analyses we used an unpruned set of variants to maintain comparability to other methods that estimate regional heritability. Since the model assumption of polygenicity may not hold in any particular genomic region [14], we also estimated regional heritability with HESS v0.5.2 (see Web Resources) to avoid assumptions about causal effect sizes. HESS requires GWAS summary statistics and genotype data to compute pairwise correlations between the variants to account for LD. To keep the allele coding between GWAS summary statistics and pairwise correlations consistent and maintain comparability with FINEMAP, we modified HESS to read in the same pre-computed pairwise correlations obtained from the original GWAS genotype data as we use in FINEMAP. We further used marginal effect size estimates on the standardized scale as input to HESS (personal communication with the authors of HESS). We ran HESS on approximately independent LD blocks [28] using all variants in the genomic region and default settings. We also ran HESS without default adjustment for noise in the LD matrix by setting the command-line flags—max-num-eig m and—min-eigval 10−8, as recommended by the authors of HESS, where m is the number of variants in the genomic region. We used genotype data on 426,844 individuals of EUR ancestry (see Web Resources) provided by UKB. For documentation about imputation of the UKB genotype data see Web Resources. We retained genotyped biallelic variants with MAF greater than 1% and excluded related individuals with KING’s [29] kinship coefficient greater than 0.0442 using a greedy algorithm that maximizes the final sample size. This left us with 374,073 samples in UKB. We used plasma level concentrations of 2,940 unique proteins measured with the antibody-based Olink Explore 3072 Proximity Extension Assay (PEA) across a randomly chosen set of 32,867 unrelated individuals of European ancestry included in UKB. Details about the proteomics data are given in Sun et al. [30]. Protein level concentrations were adjusted by age, age2, sex, age × sex, age2 × sex, batch, UKB assessment center, UKB genetic array, time between blood sampling and measurement and the first 20 genetic principal components using a linear regression model. Regression residuals were normalized using a rank-based transformation to the standard Normal distribution. The UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Projects (UKB-PPP) used REGENIE (see Web Resources) to test genome-wide associations with 2,940 proteins. We defined the level of statistical significance as P < 1.7×10−11 corresponding to the standard genome-wide significance level (P < 5 × 10−8) corrected for the number of proteins analyzed (5 × 10−8 / 2940 = 1.7×10−11). The pQTLs were defined through clumping ±1Mb around statistically significant variants, excluding the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region which is treated as one locus due to complex and extensive LD patterns. Physically overlapping regions were merged into one, deeming the variant with the lowest P-value as the lead variant. We estimated regional heritability with BOLT, HESS and FINEMAP across 14,189 pQTLs from the UKB-PPP in 28,008 unrelated individuals of European ancestry. Our motivation to use unrelated individuals is to prevent the possibility of bias across the three methods. For FINEMAP and HESS we generated summary statistics with a linear model implemented in PLINK2 (see Web Resources). With FINEMAP we either allowed for thirty causal variants or only one causal variant to estimate the heritability captured by the lead variant. The polygenic component of heritability was estimated with BOLT using genome-wide variants outside of regions defined by pQTLs ±5Mb. In the Paraoxonase 1 cis-pQTL, we performed a stepwise conditional analysis implemented in PLINK2 by first conditioning on the variant with the lowest P-value, hereafter called the lead variant, and then iteratively adding to the model the variant with the lowest conditional P-value until no further variant reached the standard genome-wide significance threshold (P < 5 × 10−8) or until we had conducted a pre-specified number of iterations. To assess how different methods estimate regional heritability we performed comprehensive simulations over genomic regions chosen from GWAS meta-analyses for coronary artery disease (CAD) [31], Crohn’s disease (CD) [32], lipid traits (LIPs) [33], schizophrenia (SCZ) [34], and type 2 diabetes (T2D) [35]. For each study, we retained the lead variants outside the HLA region with a marginal P-value less than 5 × 10−8 and selected 100 lead variants (18 from CAD, 20 from CD, 21 from LIPs, 21 from SCZ, and 20 from T2D) for further analyses. Around each lead variant, we defined genomic regions of 3 Mb. We considered the following fine-mapping setting: Increasing regional heritability (h2 = 0.00025, 0.0015, 0.05, 0.5) Increasing number of causal variants (m = 3, 50) Increasing GWAS sample size (n = 5,000, 50,000, 300,000) A total of 1,000 datasets (10 replicates per each region) were generated under each of the 24 combinations of scenarios H, M and N using the following linear model where C is the set of causal variants, gc the vector of standardized genotypes from 374,073 UKB individuals at the cth causal variant, βc the standardized effect size of the cth variant and ϵ is Normal noise with mean 0 and variance . Causal variants were randomly chosen. In datasets with three causal variants, the joint causal effect sizes were specified such that in the true causal configuration, the three variants accounted for 61.8%, 25.8% and 12.4% of the regional heritability, respectively (That is, the effect size of a standardized genotype variable of a causal variant was (h2×p)1/2, where h2 is the regional heritability and p is the proportion of heritability accounted for by the variant). These per-variant proportions were chosen from a meta-analysis of the association between MC4R locus and body mass index [36]. In simulations with fifty causal variants, joint causal effect sizes were specified such that each causal variant accounted for the same proportion of regional heritability. For each set of 1,000 simulations, we report the average heritability estimates and the average standard error (BOLT, HESS) or posterior standard deviation (FINEMAP). We also assess the uncertainty of heritability estimates across 100 simulated datasets of the same region with causal variants kept fixed. For 95% credible and confidence intervals (normal approximations), we calculate their coverage as the proportion of intervals that covered the true level of heritability. We also compute the RMSE defined as the square root of the average squared deviation of the estimated heritability from the true level of heritability. RMSE summarizes both bias and precision of the estimation procedures with smaller RMSE values indicating better performance.

Title: Crypto Daybook Americas: Turmoil Across The Pond as Bitcoin Defends $93K After $300B Wipeout

You are viewing Crypto Daybook Americas, your new morning briefing on what happened in the crypto markets overnight and what's expected during the coming day. In the coming weeks, this daily update will replace the First Mover Americas newsletter, and arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it. By James Van Straten (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) The total cryptocurrency industry is now under $3.2 trillion in market capitalization, as over $300 billion has been wiped out since Jan. 6, taking away all early gains for the year, according to the TradingView metric TOTAL. As a result, bitcoin (BTC) is now hovering above $93,000 but has been making a succession of higher lows starting from Dec. 30. Adding to the bearish sentiment, market is digesting the unconfirmed reports from DB News which suggest that the U.S. government has been given the green light to liquidate as much as 69,370 BTC ($6.5B) from the Silk Road seizure. This makes the political theatre between the outgoing and incoming U.S. administrations even more intriguing, as president-elect Donald Trump, who is just few days away from being sworn in on Jan. 20, vowed not to sell any of the bitcoin held by U.S. authorities, which, according to Glassnode data, amounts to 187,236 BTC. The onslaught in the crypto industry stems from an extremely high DXY index, above 109, which measures the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to a weighted basket of major foreign currencies. In addition, for a brief moment, the U.S. treasury yields were rising before retreating slightly yesterday. The benchmark for 10-year yield was as high as 4.73%. The inflation concerns that paddled the selloff in the broader market is picking up alongside growth expectations, LondonCryptoClub told CoinDesk. "The combination of rising growth and inflation expectations alongside rising term premia as the market struggles to digest huge treasury supply to fund these deficits is pushing U.S. yields higher, which is dragging global yields higher, excluding China." However, turmoil is occurring across the pond in the U.K., with gilt yields continuing to march higher this morning. Records were set today, as the 30-year U.K. jumped to almost 5.45%, the highest level since 1998. While the benchmark U.K. 10-year challenged 4.95%, the highest since 2008, the treasury was forced to intervene in the market to calm investors, according to reports from The Telegraph. LondonCryptoClub mentioned the key reasons for the turmoil, "the U.K. is under pressure after a disastrous budget which has increased borrowing needs with little to no positive growth impact, exacerbating the negative debt/GDP dynamics and driving a larger fiscal deficit." As a result, the not-so-Great British pound, falling yet again, is now 1.22 against the dollar, the lowest level since November 2023, and has fallen almost 4% in the past month. Today, Jan. 9, is declared a mourning day in the U.S. to remember the death of former President Jimmy Carter. Therefore, the stock market will be closed. So, all eyes will be turning to the jobs report on Friday. The market is in a good news is bad news scenario as rate cuts for 2025 get pushed back with only one rate cut expected for 2025. A strong jobs report could remove this rate cut, with unemployment expected to come in at 4.2%, while nonfarm payroll is estimated at 154,000. A hot jobs print could send the dollar to 110, putting further pressure on risk-assets. Stay alert! By Shaurya MalwaA parody token just got its own parody. AI Agents upstart ai16z, a platform mimicking venture fund a16z that uses AI to manage user funds, saw a mockery of its token raffle among smallcap speculators in the past day, running to a peak of $130 million market capitalization as of European morning hours. Where ai16z tried to blend AI with investment, LLM — short for “Large Language Model” laughs at the very concept, suggesting that if AI can be anything, it can certainly be a meme with no real utility. X users were quick to dub LLM as the "McDonald's version of $ai16z," mixing fast food with AI, creating a narrative where the only intelligence was in the marketing. Some thoughts about $LLM: it's the perfect token to mock $ai16z.1. It uses an AI-related term but is actually a funny meme without any utility, much like $fartcoin.2. It emerged organically and has a perfect distribution—everyone had a chance to buy it even before pf bonding.… It has no inherent utility or technological backing; its value is purely speculative and community-driven, based on the meme's popularity and the humor it brings to the crypto conversation. I bought it because it was funny — But now, it’s turned into a community + the ticker is ideal for the meta we’re in + the word play on the ticker can’t be funnier. AI Agent projects virtuals (VIRTUALS), ai16z (AI16Z) and the broader category are down more than 20% since peak on average in the past weeks amid criticism of their claimed AI models, as a CoinDesk analysis previously noted.

With a new Presidential administration set to take office in less than two weeks, there’s a feeling of change in the air. Some of the changes are already clear – President-elect Trump has made clear his intent to implement new tax policies, and his previous term in office has already shown that he favors pro-business, growth-oriented economic policies, along with economic deregulation. The combination promises to keep the good times rolling in the stock markets. Discover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using Tipranks' Stock Screener Watching the situation from Wolfe Research, analyst Shweta Khajuria sees plenty of options for investors who aim to cash in on a rising tide. Sound consumer demand, lower interest rates, and low unemployment, in her view, will provide a broad base of support for the overall economy – and for her own preference, of internet stocks. “We remain opportunistic within the Internet sector. We expect fundamentals to remain stable with healthy top-line growth from penetration gains & product launches, ongoing margin expansion, and capital allocation efforts,” Khajuria opined. Getting into specifics, the 5-star analyst has selected Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) as two of the best internet stocks to buy right now. According to the TipRanks database, these ‘Magnificent 7’ stocks have also earned a ‘Strong Buy’ rating from the rest of the Street. Let’s dive into the details and take a closer look at each of them. Amazon The first stock we’ll look at, Amazon, is the world leader in e-commerce, and a fast-growing giant in both cloud computing and AI services. Amazon was founded in 1994 and has proven itself to be a survivor – the company lived through the dot-com bubble burst and has grown out of its origins as ‘the online bookseller’ to become the digital world’s one-stop shop. As the global e-commerce leader, Amazon boasts that it can deliver any product to any place, and it follows through. The result is a behemoth of a company, with a market cap of $2.39 trillion. Amazon’s online retail is its core business, and made up 83% of its total revenue in the third quarter of 2024, the last period reported. Of its $131.4 billion revenue haul, $95.5 billion came from the North America segment; $35.9 billion came from international sales. The company saw its highest year-over-year revenue growth in its cloud computing subscription service, AWS, which expanded 19% y/y to reach $27.5 billion. Amazon’s overall Q3 revenue came to $158.9 billion, up 11% from the prior year and beating the forecast by $1.6 billion. Amazon reported a free cash flow of $47.7 billion for the 12 months ending on September 30, 2024, up 123% year-over-year, and the company finished Q3 with more than $78 billion in cash and liquid assets on hand. What all of this means is that Amazon has deep pockets and plenty of resources to expand and modernize both its e-commerce and cloud computing activities. The company is doing just that and is making strong use of AI as it does so. On the retail activity side, Amazon is using AI to improve its customer interfaces. The company has introduced an AI-powered shopping assistant to smooth out the process of searching the retail database for exactly the right product at the right price, and already uses AI to improve its online advertising activities. On the cloud side, Amazon is integrating AI capabilities and tools into the AWS platform and is working with the AI development company Anthropic to build generative AI models for Bedrock, Amazon’s own AI cloud platform. In addition, Amazon, under the AWS aegis, is developing and releasing a family of semiconductor chips, Trainium, designed specifically to train AI and natural language systems. At the bottom line, all of this has made Amazon enormously profitable. The company realized earnings of $1.43 per share in 3Q24, a figure that was 29 cents better than the forecasts. In addition, Amazon’s stock is up 49% in the last 12 months, outperforming the NASDAQ’s 31% gain by a wide margin. Checking in with analyst Khajuria and the Wolfe view, we find her bullish on Amazon, specifically citing the company’s strengths. Khajuria writes, “We named AMZN as a top pick at the time of our launch in July ’24, and we continue to remain constructive on it based on our three-pronged thesis: i) Upside to retail margins driven by operational efficiency gains, automation, Ad revenue growth, and sustainable Int’l profitability; ii) Healthy, sustainable AWS revenue growth in the HT% range driven by demand for AI-based workloads and inference, Trainium chips, and Anthropic; iii) Ongoing market share consolidation driven by fast delivery speeds and availability of non-discretionary items.” Moving forward from this stance, Khajuria puts an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on AMZN stock. This is complemented by a $270 price target that implies a one-year upside potential of 21%. (To watch Khajuria’s track record, click here) Overall, this mega-cap e-commerce giant has earned a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street, based on 47 recent analyst reviews that show a lopsided split of 46 Buys to just 1 Hold. The shares are priced at $222.11 and their average target price of $249.62 suggests they will gain 12% in the year ahead. (See AMZN stock forecast) Meta Platforms The second stock we’ll look at here today is Meta Platforms, the global leader in social media and the parent company of Facebook, along with Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Meta’s family of social apps had a collective DAP, or daily active people, of 3.29 billion in September 2024 – meaning that this company can effectively reach 41% of the world’s population. That’s a huge number, and it underscores just how effective Mark Zuckerberg’s company has been at building social media into a global force. Meta has used its unprecedented reach to support its revenue-generating activities, primarily digital advertising. The company’s huge audience gives it access to an enormous well of data, which can be used to fine-tune online advertising campaigns or simply sold to advertisers. In its last quarterly report, covering 3Q24, Meta reported an 11% year-over-year increase in the average price paid per ad on its platform. This solid metric helped push the company’s total revenue in the quarter to $40.59 billion, beating the forecast by $280 million while growing 19% year-over-year. Meta’s stock, like Amazon’s above, has outperformed the broader markets by a wide margin, gaining 73% in the last 12 months. That Meta is successful is beyond doubt. The company has achieved this success by adapting to changes in the digital landscape – some of those changes brought on by the very social media revolution that it helped to start. One good example is the company’s reaction to the strength of Twitter, or X, as owner Elon Musk has rebranded it. Meta developed its own threads-based app, appropriately dubbed Threads, which it launched in July 2023 as a competitor. While Threads has not yet reached the popularity of X, it has reached the milestone of 200 million active users. Meta also stands to gain from an Act of Congress which was upheld at the Federal appeals level last month. The act orders the Chinese company ByteDance to divest itself of the popular social video app TikTok – if it wants to keep the app available in the US. If the Chinese company does not comply, it risks having TikTok banned from US internet providers. While enforcement of such a ban would be difficult at best, the prospect of it may give a boost to Meta. Meta has developed several social video apps of its own (Reels and Stories on Facebook) and is strongly positioned to grab a large part of TikTok’s 170 million-strong audience should the Chinese app face a ban. The upshot to all of this is that, while Meta may be the ‘old man’ in the rapidly evolving social media world, it is hardly moribund. The company is smart and adaptable, and has proven itself capable of meeting changing conditions while realizing sound profits. Its 3Q24 earnings figure came to $6.03 per share, beating the forecast by 74 cents and growing 37% year-over-year. For Wolfe’s Khajuria, the key here is that Meta’s combination of social apps, its strength in video apps, and its ability to meet changing conditions make the company a ‘top pick.’ As she puts it, “We remain constructive despite the significant outperformance over the last two years given our view that Street estimates offer upside. Our thesis: i) We think video unification remains underappreciated based on our detailed analysis, we forecast upside to 2025 Street ests. by MSD $B; ii) We size Threads opportunity as potentially adding LSD $Bs with monetization starting in ’25; iii) TikTok divestiture remains uncertain, but should that happen, we see 8 to 10% upside to EPS; iv) Cleaner AI narrative as multi-year investments have better positioning to show ROIC potential.” Bottom line, Khajuria puts an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on Meta, and backs that with a $730 price target, showing her confidence in a 16% upside potential over the next 12 months. Meta has 43 recent analyst reviews on file, and these break down to 39 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell. The shares are currently trading for $617.89 and the average target price of $683.72 implies a one-year potential gain of 10.5%.

Javier Olivan, Chief Operating Officer of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), recently executed a sale of company stock according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. On January 6, Olivan sold 413 shares of Meta's Class A Common Stock at a price of $612.1 per share, amounting to a total transaction value of $252,797. The transaction comes as Meta trades near its 52-week high of $638.40, with the stock showing remarkable strength, having gained over 70% in the past year. According to InvestingPro analysis, Meta currently maintains a "GREAT" financial health score. Following this transaction, Olivan holds 17,101 shares directly. The sale was conducted under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which Olivan adopted on August 30, 2023. This plan allows company insiders to set up a predetermined schedule for selling stocks to avoid concerns about insider trading. In addition to his direct holdings, Olivan also has indirect ownership through various LLCs and a family trust, which collectively hold a significant number of additional shares. In other recent news, Meta Platforms has been making significant strides in strategic partnerships and policy changes. The tech giant recently announced a trial collaboration with eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), allowing users in Germany, France, and the U.S. to browse eBay listings on its Facebook Marketplace platform. This development comes in response to a European Union ruling that aimed to foster competition in the online marketplace sector. Alongside this, Meta has initiated a shift in its content moderation policy, transitioning from a U.S. fact-checking program to a community-based system. This change, inspired by a similar model used by Elon Musk's X, is intended to uphold free expression and manage the spread of information on its platforms. Additionally, Meta has expanded its board of directors with the election of three new members, Dana White, CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), John Elkann, CEO of Exor (AS:EXOR), and Charlie Songhurst, a seasoned technology investor. This move is expected to contribute to the company's strategic direction and growth in artificial intelligence and enterprise capabilities. In terms of financial analysis, Wolfe Research maintained an Outperform rating for Meta, highlighting potential financial benefits from the company's initiatives in video unification and Threads monetization. Meanwhile, JMP Securities increased the price target for Meta, citing advancements in AI and potential in extended reality as key growth catalysts. These are the recent developments shaping the dynamic environment in which Meta operates. This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Congressional Democrats appeared to greatly enhance their wealth in 2024, despite only earning a yearly salary of $174,000. Democrat stock portfolios in 2024 far outpaced the S&P 500, a study by Unusual Whales found Tuesday, spiking on average 31 percent, seven points higher than the S&P 500 (24 percent) and five points higher than Republican colleagues (26 percent). Unusual Whales estimated each member’s stock portfolio performance by calculating the value of each stock from the beginning of 2024 to the end of 2024. The biggest Democrat offender was Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), whose portfolio spiked 142 percent, the report found: Wasserman Schultz was not the only Democrat deploying an aggressive investment strategy. After Wasserman Schultz, the top seven Democrat stock traders are: Notable members’ returns: Unusual Whales reported further specifics of the congressional stock trades: But looking at the ~100 members of Congress who actively trade, only half beat the S&P. However most of Congress tracked SPY (20-27% returns), with less active trading than previous years. What’s more, those who outperformed SPY really outperformed the S&P, including in the options world (Nancy Pelosi specifically) Why? Well, because Congress often held big tech, the winners of this cycle. Holding Amazon, NVDA, META, and more boosted Congress’ returns this year. Let’s not forget that many of these big tech companies also lobby the very same people that hold company shares. Our politicians may have direct oversight over policy decisions that could financially help or hurt these companies. Congressional stock trading is an issue that unites most Americans. Eighty-six percent of Americans, including 87 percent of Republicans, 88 percent of Democrats, and 81 percent of independents, support barring members of Congress and their families from trading stocks, a poll found in 2023.

Title: What’s up with… Ligado Networks, AWS, Samsung
URL: https://www.telecomtv.com/content/access-evolution/what-s-up-with-ligado-networks-aws-samsung-52070/
Time Published: 2025-01-08T15:25:02Z
Full Content:
Jan 8, 2025 In today’s industry news roundup: Ligado Networks files for bankruptcy protection, strikes a commercial deal with AST SpaceMobile and takes former partner Inmarsat to court; Amazon Web Services is set to pump $11bn into new infrastructure in the state of Georgia to support AI and cloud services; Samsung’s Q4 sales and profits improve year on year but are still disappointing; and much more! Ligado Networks is having an interesting week. The Reston, Virginia-based company, which has aspirations to be a provider of satellite communications and private 5G networks, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection following an agreement with the majority of its investors to convert $7.8bn of their debt into preferred shares and provide $115m in funds to keep the company up and running. When it emerges from the Chapter 11 process, Ligado expects to have a debt pile of $1.2bn, compared with the $8.6bn it has currently. As part of its restructuring process, Ligado has also struck a complex commercial agreement with direct-to-cell (D2C) low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite specialist AST SpaceMobile that will see Ligado get a $550m payment form its new partner as well as warrants that can be converted into AST SpaceMobile stock (currently valued at about $120m) in 12 months’ time. In return, AST Spacemobile gets the rights to use Ligado’s valuable L-band spectrum in the 1.6 GHz band, which the company believes will significantly help its planned D2C services – AST SpaceMobile already has service agreements with AT&T and Verizon in the US (as well as more than 40 others around the world). “Adding premium lower mid-band spectrum access in the United States to the AST SpaceMobile network gives us long-term access to a large block of a scarce resource, significantly enhancing our planned space-based cellular broadband offering,” stated Abel Avellan, chairman and CEO at AST SpaceMobile. “Alongside the previously announced 850 MHz nationwide network plans, access to the largest available block of high-quality nationwide spectrum will position us to deliver on our goal of peak data transmission speeds up to 120 Mbit/s, together with our mobile network operator partners, to enable a true broadband experience directly from space to everyday smartphones.” As if that wasn’t enough, Ligado has also filed a lawsuit against satellite operator Inmarsat Global, citing an “intentional and wilful breach” of an agreement to help support Ligado’s plans in the US. Ligado said it agreed to make significant payments so that Inmarsat could upgrade its satellite terminals to avoid interference with Ligado’s services. “In exchange for Inmarsat’s efforts and the rights to use portions of Inmarsat’s spectrum bands, Ligado paid Inmarsat over $1.7bn, including a one-time lump-sum $250m ‘transition payment’... [but] Inmarsat has failed to honour its obligations under the agreement by neglecting to upgrade its own satellite terminals, deliver to Ligado portions of Inmarsat’s spectrum, and assist Ligado in its efforts to gain permission from the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] to pursue its goal of providing nationwide terrestrial wireless services to expand America’s 5G capabilities,” claimed Ligado, which is asking for a court order that would require Inmarsat to “perform its contractual duties” as well as pay compensation damages and “repay the billions Ligado paid and lost due to Inmarsat’s intentional inaction.” That’s known as a ‘big ask’. Inmarsat, which is now part of Viasat following a 2023 acquisition, told Reuters that the complaint had no legal merit and was replete with “unfounded allegations”. Another day, another massive datacentre infrastructure investment announcement. Amazon Web Services (AWS), the clear leader in the global cloud services sector, plans to invest at least $11bn to expand its cloud computing and AI infrastructure in the US state of Georgia, a move that is expected to “create at least 550 new high-skilled jobs” in technical roles, such as datacentre engineers, network specialists, engineering operations managers and security specialists, the company has announced. The catalyst for the investment is, not surprisingly, the ongoing demand for AI workloads. “Generative AI is driving increased demand for advanced cloud infrastructure and compute power, and AWS’s investments will support the future of AI from datacentres in Georgia,” noted the company. “AWS datacentres are flexible enough to efficiently run GPUs (graphics processing units) for traditional workloads or AI and machine-learning models. This deployment of cutting-edge AI infrastructure will strengthen Georgia’s position as an innovation hub,” it added. “AWS’s ongoing infrastructure investments across the United States demonstrate our relentless commitment to powering our customers’ digital innovation through cloud and AI technologies,” stated Roger Wehner, VP of economic development at AWS. “We are delighted to expand our infrastructure into Georgia with this planned multibillion-dollar investment, which we expect to create more than 550 well-paying jobs and drive significant economic growth for the state. State and local leaders have cultivated an environment that enables companies like AWS to make bold, forward-looking investments. We are excited to deepen our partnership with the state of Georgia and contribute to the continued advancement of its thriving technology landscape,” he added. The news comes just a few weeks after AWS announced a $10bn investment in Ohio and days after Microsoft, the second-largest global hyperscaler, announced that it is on track to invest $80bn in AI datacentres around the world during its current fiscal year, which ends in June 2025, and that more than half of that total will be invested in the US. The US investment news comes just as AWS also announced that its latest Asia Pacific “Infrastructure Region”, in Thailand, is now up and running, comprising three “Availability Zones” in the country. It becomes AWS’s 14th Infrastructure Region in Asia Pacific, joining Hong Kong, Hyderabad (India), Jakarta (Indonesia), Malaysia, Melbourne (Australia), Mumbai (India), Osaka (Japan), Seoul (South Korea), Singapore, Sydney (Australia), and Tokyo (Japan), as well as the Beijing and Ningxia Regions in China. AWS noted that the “adoption of cloud computing has gained significant momentum in Thailand, driven by evolving business needs and government initiatives, such as Thailand 4.0. These initiatives aim to transform Thailand into an innovation-driven economy by using emerging technologies to enhance productivity, competitiveness, and sustainable growth. Samsung estimates that its fourth-quarter revenues will come in at 75tn Korean won ($51.bn), up by just over 10% year on year, while its operating profit for the quarter is expected to be about 6.5tn Korean won ($4.45bn), up by 130% year on year, the giant tech vendor noted in this press release. While the numbers are better than a year ago, they are below what had been forecast by financial analysts, even Samsung is disappointed. “Our operating profit for Q4 2024 is projected to come in significantly below market expectations,” it admitted in this note for investors, stating that its numbers were hampered by “increased R&D expenses aimed at securing future technology leadership and the initial ramp-up costs tied to expanding production capacity for advanced technologies”. According to this Reuters report, Samsung has been “hit hard by extra costs as it works towards providing high-end chips to Nvidia”. Currently, the main supplier of the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) processors used in Nvidia’s in-demand graphics processing units (GPUs) is one of Samsung’s main rivals, South Korea’s SK Hynix: Nvidia would like to source HBM products from Samsung but its products are not currently meeting Nvidia’s requirements. According to Bloomberg, Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, told reporters at the CES 2025 event in Las Vegas, where Huang delivered the opening keynote on Monday evening, that Samsung needs to “engineer a new design” to supply HBM chips to Nvidia, adding that “they can do it and they are working very fast.” Another company that supplies HBM chips to Nvidia is Boise, Idaho-based Micron Technology, which is bolstering its presence in Asia Pacific with an investment of $7bn over the next five years or so in a new HBM advanced packaging facility located next to the company’s current facilities in Singapore. Operations for the new facility are scheduled to begin in 2026, with meaningful expansion of Micron’s total advanced packaging capacity beginning in 2027 “to meet the demands of AI growth,” the company noted in this announcement. “As AI adoption proliferates across industries, the demand for advanced memory and storage solutions will continue to increase robustly,” stated Sanjay Mehrotra, president and CEO of Micron. “With the continued support of the Singapore government, our investment in this HBM advanced packaging facility strengthens our position to address the expanding AI opportunities ahead.” Micron’s share price jumped this week after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang namechecked Micron as a key component supplier for Nvidia’s new Blackwell-based GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs (graphics processing units) that Huang unveiled during his keynote speech at CES 2025: Micron’s share price currently stands at $101.91, up by more than 13% since the start of this week. Generative AI (GenAI) system developer Anthropic, in which Amazon is a major investor, is in the process of raising $2bn in a new funding round that would value the company at $60bn, Bloomberg has reported. Anthropic, best known for its Claude large language models (LLMs), also counts SK Telecom as one of its investors – the two companies are working together on the development of a multilingual telecom sector-specific LLM called TelClaude. Which leads us on to yet more US datacentre investment news… Middle East datacentre operator Edgenex, a unit of Dubai-based property giant Damac Group (which is also an investor in Anthropic!), plans to invest $20bn in new facilities across the US in Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan and Indiana, Gulf Business has reported. Damac chairman Hussain Sajwani, who has positioned himself as an ally of Donald Trump, announced the move with the US president-elect during a press conference held at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. “The investment will support massive new datacentres across the Midwest, the Sun Belt area, and also to keep America on the cutting-edge of technology and artificial intelligence,” stated Trump. “This is an extremely exciting moment for us. Our foray into the US market in datacentres represents a significant milestone in our journey to build a global digital infrastructure platform that will empower businesses today and in the future,” Sajwani said in a statement. Sajwani isn’t the only international tech tycoon pledging to invest in the US during Trump’s second term as president: In December, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son pledged to invest $100bn in the US during Trump’s upcoming tenure, with the investments set to focus (not surprisingly) on AI and its supporting infrastructure, CNBC reported. Only days after announcing a new chief global affairs officer in the form of former Republican White House deputy chief of staff, Joel Kaplan, Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta has further cosied up to US president elect Donald Trump by announcing, in a blog titled More Speech and Fewer Mistakes, that it will end its “current third-party fact-checking programme in the United States and instead begin moving to a Community Notes programme” in a move the company is positioning as one that defends free speech. As you can imagine, that’s not quite how everyone sees it… – The staff, TelecomTV Jan 10, 2025 Jan 10, 2025 Jan 10, 2025 Jan 10, 2025 Jan 9, 2025 Sign up to receive TelecomTV's top news and videos, plus exclusive subscriber-only content direct to your inbox.

With Tom Capper, we will dive into fresh data comparing the prevalence of AI Overviews by industry, geographic location, search intent stage and more, along with what factors correlate with appearing in them. SEO may evolve, but the fundamentals remain the same. Focus on these nine basic steps to optimise your site to help boost your ranking Many things have changed in SEO since Google first came online in 1998. Today, with personalized results influenced by user behavior, location, and device, standing out in search engine results is more challenging than ever. The one thing that hasn’t changed is this: Your organic traffic is directly tied to your search engine ranking positions (SERPs). If your keywords rank at or near the top of Google’s search results, boundless traffic will follow. Conversely, a lack of visibility in the SERPs will leave your site struggling to attract organic traffic, regardless of its quality. In this guide, I’ll break down actionable steps to boost your rankings. I’m going to go out on a limb here and give you the definitive answer, “It depends.” While I recognize this is frustrating and seems like a cop-out, it’s the truth. SEO doesn’t happen in a vacuum and every situation offers a unique set of variables. Skill, budget, the level of competition, and how your website stacks up can all play a role in how quickly one can move the dial. Google’s John Mueller has said it can take “several hours to several weeks” for Google to index new or updated content. However, even with drastic changes, it can take months – or even a year – to see a significant impact. Mueller recommends: The best way to rank faster? Create high-quality, useful content that searchers will love. In Mueller’s words, make your site “fantastic.” Poor website structure and information architecture can doom even the best SEO campaigns. If your website is difficult for users to navigate and Google to crawl, your rankings are likely to suffer. Building a solid technical and UX foundation ensures both search engines and users find what they’re looking for. While Core Web Vitals (e.g., LCP, FID, and CLS) are important indicators of performance, don’t get bogged down chasing perfect scores. A site that’s technically sound and provides a great user experience will naturally outperform competitors in the long run. Audit your website using Google Search Console’s coverage and crawl stats reports. Identify and fix three major issues this week, such as broken links, slow-loading pages, mobile-friendliness problems, Core Web Vitals issues, or indexing errors. Recheck crawl stats in two weeks to confirm improvements and ensure Google can efficiently index your site. High-quality content that embodies Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T) is a cornerstone of modern SEO. Google rewards content that satisfies user intent and offers value, so prioritize crafting pieces that answer real questions and solve problems. Choose your top 3 underperforming URLs in terms of CTR or average position in Google Search Console. Update each with a fresh expert citation or new insights aligned with search intent. Add a new section or FAQ to deepen the content. Track CTR and engagement metrics over the next four weeks to measure improvement. Making your pages engaging and search-engine-friendly requires optimizing both your content and the way it’s structured. This involves crafting concise, descriptive titles, leveraging meta descriptions, and strategically using internal links to enhance user navigation and SEO performance. Identify three underperforming pages with high impressions and low CTR using Google Search Console. Rewrite their meta descriptions to align with searcher intent, incorporating primary keywords naturally. Add at least one internal link to each of these pages from related high-traffic content, using descriptive anchor text. Monitor changes in CTR and engagement metrics (e.g., bounce rate) over the next four weeks to assess improvements. Schema markup helps search engines understand your content better and enhances your visibility with rich results like star ratings, pricing details, and more. By structuring your data, you make it easier for search engines to deliver relevant information to users directly in the search results. Below is an example of Product schema markup for an ecommerce website: This code includes essential product details such as name, image, description, pricing, availability, and customer ratings, making it eligible for rich search results. Schema.org provides various schema types designed for specific content formats, including: Selecting the appropriate schema type for your content ensures better alignment with user search intent and increases your chances of appearing in rich search results. Select one key product or service page and implement schema markup using JSON-LD format. Validate the code using Google’s Rich Results Test. Track impressions, CTR, and click performance in Google Search Console over two weeks. Aim for at least a 1% CTR improvement, which can translate to 100+ additional clicks if the page receives 10,000 monthly impressions. If the initial implementation is successful, expand schema markup to five additional pages over the next month, focusing on high-traffic content. Google now prioritizes the mobile version of your website for indexing and ranking. Ensuring your site is mobile-friendly is no longer optional – it’s essential for SEO success. Key Strategies for Mobile Optimization: Actionable Recommendation Use Google Search Console’s Mobile Usability report to identify pages with issues such as “Text too small to read” or “Clickable elements too close together.” Focus on fixing three key problems, like adjusting text size, improving button spacing, or optimizing navigation. Enhance performance further by compressing images and enabling lazy loading. Monitor bounce rates and mobile impressions in Google Analytics over the next four weeks, aiming for a 5% reduction in bounce rates and improved engagement. Backlinks are still critical for SEO, but the emphasis should be on quality over quantity. Links from reputable websites signal to Google that your site provides authoritative and valuable content. That said, building backlinks isn’t an overnight win – it’s a long-term game that requires patience and consistent effort. Identify three high-authority websites in your niche using a tool like Ahrefs or Semrush. Develop a targeted outreach plan to pitch high-value content, such as a guest post or a link to an existing guide or resource on your site. Focus on offering genuine value to their audience. Track new backlinks acquired over the next three months using Google Search Console or a backlink monitoring tool, and measure their impact on referral traffic and rankings. Backlink acquisition is a marathon, not a sprint. Focus on creating high-quality content that naturally earns links, and steer clear of black-hat tactics – they’ll land you in hot water with Google. Google rewards websites that regularly update their content, as it signals ongoing relevance and authority. Stale or outdated information can damage your credibility and rankings. Review your top five performing pages in Google Analytics. Refresh two pages by adding updated data, insights, or visuals. Track engagement metrics like bounce rate and time on page over the next four weeks, and aim for a 10% improvement in these key performance indicators (KPIs). For local businesses, being visible in local search results can make or break your bottom line. Optimizing your Google Business Profile (GBP) and using location-specific keywords are essential steps. Review your Google Business Profile. Add or update three photos, refine your category selection, and ensure your business hours are accurate. Identify three location-specific keywords and incorporate them into your homepage or a key service page. Monitor local impressions in GBP Insights over two weeks to measure impact. If you serve users in multiple countries, international SEO ensures your content resonates with diverse languages, regions, and cultures. Identify your top international markets in Google Analytics. Implement hreflang tags for at least one language or region, and translate your highest-performing page. Monitor international traffic in Google Analytics over three months to track growth. SEO doesn’t have to feel overwhelming. Start by implementing one or two actionable steps this week, such as refreshing content, updating your GBP, or optimizing a page for international audiences. Use tools like Google Analytics and Search Console to track your progress over the next month and adjust as needed. SEO may evolve, but the fundamentals remain the same. By focusing on key strategies like delivering great content, optimizing for mobile and local audiences, and building high-quality backlinks, you can position your site for long-term success. Make incremental improvements, track your metrics, and adapt based on what works. With a consistent approach, you’ll see your rankings, traffic, and engagement improve over time.

Inflation fears drag down U.S. marketsU.S. stocks fell and Treasury yields rose on Tuesday as the ISM services index shows a big jump in prices for December. Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed on Wednesday. South Korea's Kospi rose 1.3%. It was boosted by shares of Samsung Electronics, which climbed around 3.6% even as the company forecast that its fourth-quarter profits would come in lower than LSEG expectations. Meta ends fact-checking programMeta on Tuesday announced it will eliminate its third-party fact-checking program to "restore free expression" and move to a "Community Notes" model, similar to the system on Elon Musk's platform X. Employees took to their internal forum and criticized the company's decision, made two weeks before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration. Anthropic's potential $60 billion valuationAnthropic, the artificial intelligence startup founded by former OpenAI research executives, is in late-stage talks to raise as much as $2 billion at a $60 billion valuation, CNBC has confirmed. The funding round is being led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, according to a person familiar with the matter. Anthropic, which has been backed heavily by Amazon, is the creator of the AI chatbot Claude. India might benefit from Trump, portfolio manager saysU.S. President-elect's Donald Trump's plans to impose heavy tariffs on China make India's geopolitical positioning "favorable in this Trump 2.0 era," according to GIB Asset Management's portfolio manager Kunal Desai. India is an attractive investment destination because of its monetary sovereignty and improving return on equity, Desai said. [PRO] Cautionary signs in stock marketHoward Marks, the co-founder and co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management who famously foresaw the dot-com bubble, is seeing five cautionary signs in the stock market. While Marks isn't calling it a bubble, he's concerned over signs of froth in equities. Here's what investors should pay attention to, according to Marks. In a sign of how much investors are currently worried about inflation returning, the Institute for Supply Management's services index, an inflation reading typically secondary to more significant data points like the consumer price index, is sending shock waves through the market. The price index for December's ISM report jumped to 64.4% from 58.2% in November, representing a rise of more than 10%. It's the first time since January 2024 the reading has come in above 60%, noted Steve Miller, chair of ISM's Business Survey Committee. That might only be the start of an unwelcome upward trend. Miller attributes some of the expansion in service activity to "risk management for impacts from ports strikes and potential tariffs" — both of which generate inflationary pressures. In response, investors pushed up the 10-year Treasury yield to 4.699% during the U.S. trading day, the highest level since April 26. They also dialed down their expectations for a 25 basis points rate cut at the U.S. Federal Reserve's January meeting, pricing in a 4.8% chance of that happening, down from an 8.6% probability just a day ago, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. Stocks suffered. The S&P 500 dropped 1.11%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.42% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 1.89%, dragged down by a fall in tech stocks. Nvidia slumped 6.2%, breaking its three-day winning streak. "You're getting a recalibration of inflation expectations and Fed rate expectations. That's triggered this small sell-off in the equity markets after the earlier enthusiasm," said Tom Hainlin, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Asset Management Group. But the strong ISM report also suggests the U.S. economy's still doing well, which provides fertile ground for profit growth, said Hainlin. And as David Lefkowitz, CIO head of US equities for UBS, wrote in a Monday note, "profit growth matters more" than valuation for returns over the next 12 months. One data point from one measure of inflation doesn't chart out the path of inflation or corporate health for the year ahead. But it pays to tread carefully for now. — CNBC's Jeff Cox, Sean Conlon, Pia Singh and Lisa Kailai Han contributed to this report. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Meta kills its fact checking programme and house prices keep rising

Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning Meta is to shut down its third-party fact-checking programme, moving to the so-called community notes model favoured by rival platform X, and lift restrictions it had previously imposed on some topics on its platform. Under the new rules, users of Facebook, Instagram and Threads will be able to flag posts that are potentially misleading and need more context. The announcement came shortly after conservative Joel Kaplan was named as Meta’s new head of global policy, replacing former UK Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg. The move also comes a day after the company named three new directors to its board, including Dana White, UFC chief executive and a close friend of US President-elect Donald Trump. Ciara O’Brien reports. House prices across the country will probably rise by as much as 8 per cent this year, according to estate agent DNG, which would bring the average price of a second-hand home in Dublin to almost €630,000. The company, in its latest residential market review and outlook, forecasts prices will “continue to rise”, with an increase of “at least mid-single digit figures” anticipated due to the “continued lack of new homes available to purchase by private buyers”. Colin Gleeson has the story. In his column, John McManus looks at how a Workplace Relations Commission ruling has essentially killed off the idea of a worker’s right to work from home, and what the wider ramifications of the ruling may be. We all want to save money if we can, but there are many different places to store your money depending on what you are saving for. In Money Matters, Joanne Hunt looks at the issues at play and the options savers have. Angry truckers are accusing a shipping company of price gouging after it doubled charges for some loads on the Irish Sea as a result of Holyhead’s closure. As Barry O’Halloran reports, Luxembourg-based shipping group CLDN has told hauliers ago that it would require a surcharge of twice the normal booking rate for any loads above a company’s “usual allocations”. Barry also reports that a key British division of developer Sean Mulryan’s Ballymore Group earned €1.6 million profit in the 12 months to March 31st, reversing the previous year’s €6 million loss, accounts show. At least €100 million in warehoused debt from a scheme introduced to help businesses during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic is not recoverable, Revenue has said. Colin Gleeson reports that some €3 billion of the €3.2 billion included in the warehouse at its peak in January 2022 has now been either settled or secured under a phased payment arrangement. Fresh plans for an apartment scheme by Lioncor on the grounds of Terenure College in Dublin have addressed all the grounds for refusal to a previous scheme, according to planning documentation lodged by the developer. Gordon Deegan has read the report. Digital pathology company Deciphex has raised $32.3 million (€31 million) from investors in a new funding round that will help fuel its global expansion. The company secured backing for its Series C round from Molten Ventures, with significant participation from ACT Venture Capital, Seroba, Charles River Laboratories, IRRS Investments, HBAN Medtech Syndicate and Nextsteps Capital. Ciara has the story. Bank of Ireland is to cut rates on certain deposit products, becoming the first domestic bank to do so since the European Central Bank (ECB) started to cut official borrowing costs last June. Joe Brennan reports. Joe also reports that Deutsche Bank analysts see AIB’s net interest income sliding 11 per cent this year, at almost twice the pace of the other two domestic retail banks, as it downgraded its rating on the AIB’s stock. Novo Banco, the Portuguese bank led by former AIB chief financial officer Mark Bourke, fired its chief risk officer following an internal probe into what the lender described as “suspicious” financial transactions. Planning permission for almost 900 apartments on the site of the old Dundrum shopping centre in Dublin has been refused following a long-running battle and hundreds of objections from locals.

Inflation fears drag down U.S. marketsU.S. stocks fell and Treasury yields rose on Tuesday as the ISM services index shows a big jump in prices for December. Europe's regional Stoxx 600 index added 0.32%. Shares of Volvo Car closed more than 9% higher after the Swedish carmaker reported a new global sales record for 2024.

UK's long-term borrowing costs surgeYields on long-dated U.K. government bonds or gilts surged to their highest levels since the late 1990s after a tepid debt auction fueled worries over demand. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said concerns are growing that the U.K. may encounter stagflation — a scenario where inflation stays high or rises while economic growth slows.

Title: Stock market today: Nasdaq leads stock declines as traders pare rate cut bets, Nvidia plummets after record close

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks reversed early gains to close firmly lower as cautious investors weighed new economic data, while Nvidia (NVDA) retreated from its record close despite the company's big artificial intelligence plans. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell over 1.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lost roughly 1.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) bounced around throughout the day but ended the session down about 0.4%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added roughly 7 basis points to hover just below 4.7%. And bets on when the Federal Reserve will next cut interest rates were pushed back, too. Early on Tuesday, the Institute for Supply Management's nonmanufacturing PMI indicated the service sector continued to expand last month, although the prices paid index jumped to a nearly two-year high of 64.4, up from the prior 58.2. The surge in prices "is a worry for the Fed," Capital Economics North America economist Thomas Ryan wrote. "This serves as a good reminder that the Fed's fight against inflation is not over, particularly going into a year where tariffs and immigration curbs are set to reignite price pressures." Additionally, JOLTS job openings rose more than expected during the month of November. Fewer hires were also made compared to the previous month while the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, fell to 1.9% from 2.1% in October. The data sets the stage for Friday's all-important December jobs report. Investors are now betting with almost certainty that the central bank keeps interest rates unchanged later this month, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Traders are also placing a less than 50% chance the central bank cuts rates ahead of its June meeting. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares reversed gains to fall over 6% after hitting a record close just one day prior. The chip maker was the Dow's worst performer of the session. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's CES keynote on Monday revealed a new AI superchip among other planned products. US stocks closed in a sea of red on Tuesday as traders recalibrated Fed rate cut bets following a string of mixed economic data and concerns over an uptick in inflation. Big Tech led the declines with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shedding roughly 1.9%, dragged down by shares of Nvidia (NVDA), which lost over 6%. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell over 1.1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) ended the session down about 0.4%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added roughly 7 basis points to hover just below 4.7%. Job openings rose more than economists expected in November, but other signs of cooling in the labor market have persisted as fewer Americans left their jobs and hiring continued to slow. On Tuesday, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed 5.27 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.39 million made during October. The hiring rate fell to 3.3% from the 3.4% seen in October. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, fell to 1.9% from 2.1% in October. Both the quits rate and hiring rate are now lower than they were before pandemic. Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten described Tuesday's release as consistent with a "no hire, no fire" labor market. Largely, this is seen as an OK scenario for the Federal Reserve's maximum employment mandate, as long as conditions don't worsen. In December, Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the labor market as "looser than pre-pandemic" but also noted that, for now, the labor market is cooling in a "gradual and orderly way." The key question remains whether things can stay in this state if the Fed holds interest rates steady over the next several months or if more softness emerges, prompting a rate move from the central bank. "We don’t think we need further cooling in the labor market to get inflation down to 2%," Powell said. Trump made quite a few eyebrow-raising comments over the past few days, from suggesting Canada could become the 51st US state to implying military force could be used to acquire the Panama Canal and Greenland. But one strategist told Yahoo Finance not to pay too much attention to the president-elect's policies or rhetoric. At least not yet. "Trump's approach is very simple in a lot of ways," Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, told Yahoo Finance's Market Domination. "There are a lot of outlandish comments and objectives that will largely go by the wayside." Arone noted that while Trump will likely attempt to tackle or make progress on most of his campaign promises, like tax cuts for corporations and curbs on immigration, much of his rhetoric will likely be used as a bargaining chip or a starting point to negotiate something better. "Look at what already happened this week with tariffs," he said, referring to a Washington Post report from earlier this week that said Trump's team is now exploring more limited tariffs than anticipated. "We've seen this movie before," he said. "That's why investors are too obsessed with all the outcomes on this." Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: The surprise departure of Federal Reserve vice chair for supervision Michael Barr is focusing new attention on Michelle Bowman, named by analysts as the person most likely to become the Fed’s new top banking cop. The conservative Fed governor and former state banking commissioner of Kansas "seems like the likely choice," Stifel chief Washington policy strategist Brian Gardner said in a note Monday. Bowman "is the logical candidate," added TD Cowen’s Jaret Seiberg in a separate note. What helps Bowman's chances, according to analysts, is that there currently is no empty seat on the Fed's board of governors for Trump to fill with an outsider. Barr said he will remain as a Fed governor until his term is up in 2032. So Trump either has to leave the Fed vice chair for supervision position empty until Fed governor Adriana Kugler's term expires Jan. 31, 2026, or nominate an existing Fed governor to the post. Bowman would fit that qualification. Bowman, if selected, could take the regulation of the nation’s largest banks in a new direction. Read more here. Meta shares fell nearly 2% on Tuesday after CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced an end to the company's third-party fact-checking program. Originally designed to curb misinformation, the program will now be replaced by a user-driven model similar to X's Community Notes. "We are going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies, and restoring free expression on our platforms," Zuckerberg said in a video posted by the company. "Fact-checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they have created, especially in the US." “We’ve reached a point where it’s just too many mistakes and too much censorship.” As Yahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban reports, the move highlights intersecting shifts in media, technology, and politics as the Biden era comes to an end. Meta is responding to competition from X as popular platforms continue to shun traditional media and as tech industry executives attempt to win favor under a second Trump administration. Shares of AI software firm Palantir Technologies fell more than 6% after Morgan Stanley reinstated coverage of the company with an Underweight rating. Morgan Stanley analyst Sanjit Singh set his 12-month price target for the stock at $60, implying shares could drop another 15% on top of Tuesday's decline. Even with Tuesday's drop Palantir shares have rallied over 340% over the past year, fueled by a broader boom in artificial intelligence and the US government’s growing interest in AI war technologies. The stock was added to the S&P 500 in September. Its most recent quarterly earnings surpassed expectations thanks to higher-than-anticipated spending from the US government on its AI tech. Palantir is led by oft-controversial CEO Alex Karp and was co-founded by conservative tech mogul Peter Thiel. The firm has at times faced backlash for its partnerships with government agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). Bitcoin (BTC-USD) dropped below the critical $100,000 mark on Tuesday, echoing broader market losses as better-than-expected economic data sparked fears of an inflation resurgence. In mid-afternoon trade, the largest cryptocurrency traded around $97,000 a token after prices on Monday topped $100,000 for the first time since Dec. 19. Smaller cryptocurrencies like ethereum (ETH-USD) dropped 7% to trade above $3,400 a coin. Vaccine makers' stocks rose Tuesday following the first reported bird flu death in the US as well as an uptick in COVID-19 cases, per CDC data. Moderna (MRNA) surged nearly 12%. Moderna in July 2024 was awarded $176 million from the US government to advance the development of its mRNA H5N1 (bird flu) vaccine, which is in early stages of testing. Pfizer (PFE) is also developing an mRNA vaccine for H5N1. Shares of the company rose a more modest 1.4% midday Tuesday. Its partner on a COVID-19 vaccine, BioNTech (BNTX), rose over 5%. Meanwhile, German biotech firm CureVac (CVAC) rose 5.9%. CureVac is developing an mRNA bird flu shot in collaboration with Indian pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline (GLAXO.BO), which was up a little more than 1%. Also amid the COVID-19 uptick, vaccine maker Novavax (NVAX) rose over 10%. The US dollar (DX=F, DX-Y.NYB) pushed higher on Tuesday, rebounding after the currency was on track for a one-week low following reports President-elect Donald Trump won't commit to an aggressive tariff plan. “The dollar has swung to a gain today after the ISM services (54.1) and job openings (8.1M) strongly beat expectations in December, leading markets to roll back their expectations for Federal Reserve easing this year to only 33 basis points," Kyle Chapman, FX markets analyst at Ballinger Group, wrote in an email. “There are two main points leading the dollar higher. The first is a rebound in labor demand reflected in the strong rise in job openings, and the second is the strongest ISM prices paid index since February 2023," he said. Prices paid in the services sector jumped to a nearly two-year high, suggesting the inflation fight is not yet finished. Following the data's release, traders scaled back rate cut bets, placing a less than 50% chance the central bank cuts rates ahead of its June meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool. "It is certainly too early to call a reacceleration in inflation from this round of data, and markets will take the bigger clues from non-farms on Friday," Chapman said. "With the market now firmly biased towards only a single rate cut this year, for me the room is only growing for a pullback in the overstretched hawkish repricing of the Fed path.” President-elect Donald Trump announced a new multibillion-dollar foreign investment to build new data centers across the United States as interest and exploration of artificial intelligence intensifies. Trump revealed on Tuesday that Damac Group, based in Dubai and backed by billionaire developer Hussain Sajwani, will invest $20 billion into the build-out. "They feel so strongly about the country that they want to let people know about it," the president-elect said during a press briefing at Mar-a-Lago. "It's an honor to have such a great investor." Trump said the investment will be used to create "massive new data centers" across the Midwest and Sunbelt regions "and keep America on the cutting edge of technology and artificial intelligence." The project's first phase will begin in a handful of states, including Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Michigan, and Indiana, among others. Prices paid in the services sector during December shot higher, casting concern over the path forward for inflation. Data from the Institute of Supply Management showed the prices paid index jumped to a reading of 64.4 in December, up from 58.2 the month prior. Broadly, activity in the sector also increased with the ISM services index rising to 54.1 in December from 53.5 in November. "The surge in the prices paid index to a nearly two-year high of 64.4, from 58.2, is a worry for the Fed as it is consistent with PCE supercore inflation remaining at 3.5% until the middle of next year," Capital Economics North America economist Thomas Ryan wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. "This serves as a good reminder that the Fed's fight against inflation is not over, particularly going into a year where tariffs and immigration curbs are set to reignite price pressures." The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) quickly moved higher after the release, adding roughly 7 basis points to hover just below 4.7%. And bets on when the Federal Reserve will next cut interest rates were pushed back too. Traders now see a less than 50% chance the Fed cuts rates before the central bank's June meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Yesterday, traders saw a roughly 55% chance the Fed will have cut interest rates by at least 25 basis points by the end of its May meeting. Markets sold off as rates chugged higher. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which opened the day in the green, was down about 1%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC), which had also been positive earlier in the session, fell about 0.4% Job openings rose more than expected in November as investors continue to dissect the pace of the labor market slowdown amid questions over how much further the Federal Reserve will slash interest rates this year. New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Tuesday showed that 8.1 million jobs were open at the end of November, an increase from the 7.84 million in October. The October figure was revised higher from the 7.74 million open jobs initially reported. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected Tuesday's report to show 7.74 million openings in November The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed 5.27 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.39 million made during October. The hiring rate fell to 3.3% from 3.4% in October. Also in Tuesday's report, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, fell to 1.9% from 2.1% in October. Total quits decreased to 3.07 million from 3.28 million in October. US stocks edged higher on Tuesday, with Nvidia (NVDA) once again lifting market sentiment. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) inched up 0.3%, holding near tech-fueled prior-session gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also rose 0.3%, while those on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added around 0.2%. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose as much as 2.5% in premarket trading following CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote at the tech industry’s annual CES trade show in Las Vegas late Monday. Huang's presentation gave a flurry of updates on upcoming Nvidia products that preview what’s next in the burgeoning artificial intelligence market and other emerging technologies. Nvidia shares closed at a record high of $149.43 Monday ahead of Huang’s keynote — eclipsing its prior record close of $148.88 reached back on Nov. 7. Read more here.

Title: Nvidia CEO unveils robot training tech, Toyota deal and new gaming chips

AI to better train robots and cars as well as new gaming chips dominated Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's keynote speech at the CES 2025 conference on as the world's second most valuable firm expounded upon its potential to expand its business. Nvidia introduced what it calls Cosmos "foundation" models that generate photo-realistic video which can be used to train robots and self-driving cars at a much lower cost than using conventional data. By creating what is known in the tech industry as "synthetic" training data, the models can help robots and cars understand the physical world similar to the way that large language models helped chatbots generate responses in natural language. Users will be able to give Cosmos a text description that can be used to generate video of a world that obeys the laws of physics. This promises to be much cheaper than gathering data as it is done today. To train self-driving cars, for example, companies have fleets of vehicles that roam streets to gather data, and humanoid robots are often trained by having real humans repeat tasks over and over. Huang, however, cautioned that the Cosmos models will need much more data before hitting their "ChatGPT moment". Cosmos will be made available on an "open licence," similar to Meta Platforms Llama3 language models that have become widely used in the tech industry. "We really hope (Cosmos) will do for the world of robotics and industrial AI what Lama3 has done for enterprise AI," Huang said. The new gaming chips use Nvidia's 'Blackwell' AI technology to give video games movie-like graphics, especially in a field known as 'shaders,' which can help images like a ceramic teapot look more realistic by adding imperfections and fingerprint smudges to its surface. The new chips also have AI technology to help game developers generate more accurate human faces, an area where players are apt to notice even slightly unrealistic features. The chips, which Nvidia calls its RTX 50 series, will range in price from US$549 to US$1,999, with top models arriving on January 30 and lower-tier models coming in February. Nvidia said its mid-grade US$549 gaming chips will match the company's previous flagship chip, the RTX 4090 which sold for US$1,600. Nvidia also said that Toyota Motor will use its Orin chips and automotive operating system to power advanced driver assistance across several models. It did not give details about the models. Huang expects automotive hardware and software revenue of US$5 billion by February 2026, up from an expected US$4 billion this year. CES 2025, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, runs January 7-10 in Las Vegas and is used to debut products ranging from new automotive technology to quirky gadgets, as well as showing new ways to use artificial intelligence. Nvidia's stock closed at a record high of US$149.43 on Monday, bringing its valuation to US$3.66 trillion and making it the world's second-most valuable listed company behind Apple.

Title: Jeremy Siegel: The 2025 Outlook for Stocks and the Economy

Time Published: 2025-01-07T16:48:18Z

A business journal from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania The coming year could see tech stocks cooling off and very modest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, Wharton’s Jeremy Siegel predicts. Jeremy Siegel Shankar Parameshwaran The coming year could see a cooling-off of the stock market from the scorching growth of the past two years, especially for tech stocks, and very modest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, Wharton emeritus professor of finance Jeremy Siegel said in December on the Wharton Business Daily radio show on SiriusXM. (Listen to the podcast.) And while businesses are optimistic about deregulation in President-elect Donald Trump’s second term, top concerns in 2025 include how his policies on immigration and tariffs could play out, he added. Following are key takeaways from the interview: Siegel said he expected the stock market to be less upbeat in the coming year. “We’ve had two really fantastic stock market years. They exceeded my expectation this year with another 20% plus gain on top of what we had in 2023,” he said. “I expect it to be more muted [in 2025]. I see [growth in] equities being zero to 10%,” and a correction — a 10% drop — is certainly a possibility, he added. In particular, Siegel saw the possibility of “some cool off” with tech stocks. He noted that even as AI is trending strong, “there seems to be possibilities of more competition and some slowdown in that area” in 2025, he said. Disappointments on AI could be the top dampener for tech stocks, Siegel said. Specifically, the top worries would be around the speed at which AI adoption occurs, and potential competition for market leader Nvidia and its Blackwell chips, and pushback from China, he added. China recently launched a probe into Nvidia, suspecting violations of its anti-monopoly law. “All this is on top of the big uncertainties of President-elect Trump’s tariffs and immigration policy.” Siegel said his median forecast for the stock market is a bit of a slowdown from the pace of the past two years, and not really a bear market. The “standard error” in estimating stock market returns is 20%, which means that in any given year, it could be up 20%, or zero, up 10%, down 10%, or even more extreme than that,” he said. But at the same time, “it is so hard to predict on a one-year [basis],” he added. He noted that although “valuations … for the entire market [are] on the high side, I don’t think they’re crazy.” “Tech firms, [led by the so-called] Mag Seven, have brought home the bacon,” he said. “They produced earnings growth of 25% to 30%. But they’re one-third of the market. I could see them cooling in 2025, to maybe being flat on the whole.” The Magnificent Seven stocks are Nvidia, Alphabet, Tesla, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Apple. If the Magnificent Seven give up some space, “that would give the other 493 stocks [in the S&P 500] a chance to shine, selling at a much more reasonable price earnings ratio of 18 to 20,” Siegel continued. The S&P 500 as a whole is priced at 22 times earnings, which is within the range of equilibrium of around 20, he pointed out. The Federal Reserve on December 18 lowered its funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 4.25%-4.5%, noting positive signs on inflation and unemployment. (Note: This interview with Professor Siegel was conducted before the latest Fed meeting.) “Tech firms, [led by the] Mag Seven, have brought home the bacon…. I could see them cooling in 2025, to maybe being flat on the whole.” — Jeremy Siegel Anticipating that reduction at the Fed’s December meeting, Siegel said that he did not expect another rate cut in January. “My feeling is maybe only a 50 basis points cut next year.” That would put the Fed funds rate at between 3.5%-3.75%, which is “far higher” than the Fed’s own long-term estimate, and higher than its estimate at the September meeting, he added. According to Siegel, the “r star,” or natural rate of interest under 2% inflation is probably between 3.5% and 4%, after taking into account the stimulus to the economy, the deficits, and the uncertainties that loom. The Fed defined the r-star as the real short-term interest rate expected to prevail when an economy is at full strength and inflation is stable. Approaching normalization of the interest rate structure would make room for a “recalibration” of the long-term interest rates, which in non-recessionary times is between 100 and 150 basis points higher than short-term interest rates, Siegel noted. “So, if you can get the Fed funds rate down to 3.5%, we’ll see the 10-year at 4.5% to 5%, or potentially even a little higher.” The 10-year Treasury rate was trending around 4.5% in the third week of December. Small, independent and medium-sized businesses are optimistic about deregulation in Trump’s second term, Siegel said. He pointed to improved sentiment in the latest Small Business Optimism Index put out by the National Federation of Independent Businesses; this sentiment indicator showed its highest reading since June 2021. Recollections of deregulation during Trump’s first term played a role in that sentiment boost, Siegel noted. “People are saying, ‘Hey, you know what? Things were pretty good for those smaller businesses during Trump’s first term.’ And they’re hoping for a repeat in 2025 and 2026.” Trump’s threat to impose higher tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico is one of the biggest uncertainties for U.S. businesses. Trump will start using the threat of tariffs “as a negotiating tool,” Siegel said. “He loves to come in with a very strong position and negotiate down from there,” he said. At the same time, the president-elect has to be aware of the potential consequences of that approach on inflation and on businesses, he cautioned. He listed Trump’s positions on tariffs and immigration as the “two big uncertainties” for the economy. “It would be surprising to me if [Trump] pursued policies that were highly detrimental to the economy, because that would be reflected right away in the stock market.” — Jeremy Siegel That said, Trump is unlikely to act in ways that would purposely hurt stock market sentiment, Siegel suggested. “He is the most outspokenly pro-stock market President we have ever had,” and one who measures his success as a president on how well the stock market does, he added. “It would be surprising to me if he pursued policies that were highly detrimental to the economy, because that would be reflected right away in the stock market.” Geopolitical concerns weigh heavily on the outlook for 2025, ranging from the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and around China on multiple fronts. Trump could help ease some of those pressures with his promises of entering into negotiations on Ukraine and the Gaza Strip immediately after taking office, Siegel said. “With what has happened in Syria, it might make the time right for a deal on both those fronts,” he added. “That would take out a lot of uncertainty. It’s far from a done deal, and things could spiral out of control. The markets, by continuing to be strong, are actually hoping for settlements in those two troubled areas.” On the ongoing threat potential of China acting against Taiwan, Trump might try to get together with Xi Jinping, “but that is also very, very uncertain,” Siegel said. “Fortunately, we don’t have a shooting war in Asia yet.” One of the top worries in 2025 will be around cybersecurity, especially from state-sponsored bad actors, Siegel said. “I wouldn’t like to wake up in the morning and try to get access to my bank accounts and brokerage accounts and find they’re all locked out.” That worry is “a nationwide phenomenon that could throw the world into chaos,” he added. According to Siegel, the government ought “to consider cybersecurity as important as our military preparedness and spend a lot of resources to make sure that’s there.” Securing the electricity grids is another priority, he said, noting that the emerging AI sector has high power requirements. “Those are two areas where we certainly need to spend resources if we are to realize the potential gains from artificial intelligence.” A business journal from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania ©2025 Knowledge at Wharton.

Thanks for supporting the site! kottke.org. home of fine hypertext products since 1998. 🍔 💀 📸 😭 🕳️ 🤠 🎬 🥔 From The Verge: Meta abandons fact-checking on Facebook and Instagram in favor of Community Notes. Facebook, Instagram, and Threads are ditching third-party fact-checkers in favor of a Community Notes program inspired by X, according to an announcement penned by Meta’s new Trump-friendly policy chief Joel Kaplan. Meta is also moving its trust and safety teams from California to Texas. Here is Mark Zuckerberg’s thread about the announcement: It’s time to get back to our roots around free expression and giving people voice on our platforms. Here’s what we’re going to do: 1/ Replace fact-checkers with Community Notes, starting in the US. 2/ Simplify our content policies and remove restrictions on topics like immigration and gender that are out of touch with mainstream discourse. 3/ Change how we enforce our policies to remove the vast majority of censorship mistakes by focusing our filters on tackling illegal and high-severity violations and requiring higher confidence for our filters to take action. 4/ Bring back civic content. We’re getting feedback that people want to see this content again, so we’ll phase it back into Facebook, Instagram and Threads while working to keep the communities friendly and positive. 5/ Move our trust and safety and content moderation teams out of California, and our US content review to Texas. This will help remove the concern that biased employees are overly censoring content. 6/ Work with President Trump to push back against foreign governments going after American companies to censor more. The US has the strongest constitutional protections for free expression in the world and the best way to defend against the trend of government overreach on censorship is with the support of the US government. It’ll take time to get this all right and these are complex systems so they’ll never be perfect. But this is an important step forward and I’m looking forward to this next chapter! I wildly underestimated how quickly the big media and social media companies were going to kowtow to the incoming president. From The NY Times: Meta’s move is likely to please the administration of President-elect Donald J. Trump and its conservative allies, many of whom have disliked Meta’s practice of adding disclaimers or warnings to questionable or false posts. Mr. Trump has long railed against Mr. Zuckerberg, claiming the fact-checking feature treated posts by conservative users unfairly. Since Mr. Trump won a second term in November, Meta has moved swiftly to try to repair the strained relationships he and his company have with conservatives. Mr. Zuckerberg noted that “recent elections” felt like a “cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech.” In late November, Mr. Zuckerberg dined with Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago, where he also met with his secretary of state pick, Marco Rubio. Meta donated $1 million to support Mr. Trump’s inauguration in December. Last week, Mr. Zuckerberg elevated Mr. Kaplan, a longtime conservative and the highest-ranking Meta executive closest to the Republican Party, to the company’s most senior policy role. And on Monday, Mr. Zuckerberg announced that Dana White, the head of the Ultimate Fighting Championship and a close ally of Mr. Trump’s, would join Meta’s board. BTW, Dana White, a violent man who assaulted his wife, got a warm welcome to Meta’s board from Instagram/Threads chief Adam Mosseri: “Excited to have you on board!” Everyone is falling in line. And all those $1 million donations to Trump’s inaugural fund from tech & media companies and CEOs are nothing but racket protection payments. I don’t think this actually has a whole lot to do with Zuckerberg’s or Meta’s commitment to free speech. What Zuckerberg and Meta have realized is the value, demonstrated by Trump, Musk, and MAGA antagonists, of saying that you’re “protecting free speech” and using it as cover for almost anything you want to do. For Meta, that means increasing engagement, decreasing government oversight and interference, and lowering their labor costs (through cutting their workforce and strengthening their bargaining position vs labor) — all things that will make their stock price go up and increase the wealth of their shareholders. Decreasing moderation and allowing more political & hate speech (I don’t now how else to read “remove the vast majority of censorship mistakes by focusing our filters on tackling illegal and high-severity violations” — hate speech is protected speech in the US) will increase engagement overall, any AI bots they want to unleash to spur engagement don’t have to be moderated, TX is more labor- and corporate-friendly than CA (I’m sure this is also part of Meta’ ongoing negotiation with CA about letting them have more leeway or they’ll leave the state), and I think the benefit of rethinking their rules to be more friendly to conservatives is self-explanatory. Sort by: thread — thread . latest . faves now that authoritarian bullies are in charge, Zuck can get rid of the pretense he cares about race-baiting right wing propaganda and hate speech online, and fully pursue mindless engagement chasing under the pretense he's just super interested in free speech and fighting "censorship" The key thing to understand about Meta without guard rails is that, when they allowed their platform to exist without any content controls in Myanmar under an extremist leader, it was used to directly enable a genocide. Zuckerberg knows that its level of threat. https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/asia-and-the-pacific/south-east-asia-and-the-pacific/myanmar/report-myanmar/ Facebook suppressed promotion of political content during a Democratic administration and is restoring it for a Republican one https://bsky.app/profile/brianstelter.bsky.social/post/3lf5muzv3wk2g Let’s be clear—the fact checkers have not “been” politically biased as Zuck suggests, but have been *perceived as such* because of politically motivated efforts to smear them, one that Zuck is now participating in and capitulating to. 1/ https://bsky.app/profile/brianstelter.bsky.social/post/3lf5mthm5m22g This is one of those unstated subtexts that everyone acts on without acknowledging it explicitly, that "free speech" simply applies to being able to conservatives being able to say nasty things about people without those people being able to respond https://bsky.app/profile/owillis.bsky.social/post/3lf5o4bz3g22p Fact-checking wasn’t “biased” against conservatives. Conservatives just shared more false content. If there’s a sportsball game and one team fouls four times as much, it’s not “biased” for the ref to call four times as many fouls against that team. https://bsky.app/profile/dgrand.bsky.social/post/3lf5tbabslk2x NEW: On the same day Mark Zuckerberg announces Meta's new commitment to "Free Expression," internal employee dissent and criticism is being censored https://www.404media.co/facebook-deletes-internal-employee-criticism-of-new-board-member-dana-white/ Reporter: Meta announced they will stop doing fact checks.. Trump: I think they’ve come a long way Reporter: Do you think he’s responding to the threats you’ve made in the past Trump: Probably Meta is facing an antitrust trial in April. The company has lots of other business before the U.S. government. And Trump once threatened to send Zuckerberg to jail. That's just some of the background for today's big Meta changes. There's more in this AM's Reliable Sources newsletter: https://cnn.it/3C7tFDp NEW: Meta changed its Community Guidelines today to permit "allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism and homosexuality" @knibbs.bsky.social https://www.wired.com/story/meta-immigration-gender-policies-change/ I talked to 10 current and former Meta employees about the company's surrender to the right on speech issues.

Kevin Indig explores the breakthrough trends and technologies that will shape the future of marketing this 2025. The point of making predictions is not to be right but to understand reality so well that you can make an educated guess about where it goes and learn something in the process. I also enjoy the discussion I have based on sharing my predictions. They always make me smarter. So, please share your opinions in the comments. Previous predictions: 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 2024 was a big breakthrough year: I made eight predictions for this year: I expected concrete features and feature improvements from AI – and I got it right. A lot of big sites shipped better experiences thanks to AI: Tripadvisor, Booking, Expedia, Trip.com, Nextdoor, Ebay, Amazon, and more. As I highlighted in my latest Travel deep dive, we’ve seen the first real results from AI Features: TripAdvisors review pages doubled in organic traffic after adding AI-generated review summaries. The bigger picture: AI trickles through all aspects of Product. The key to monetization is making it useful – not just cool. And 2024 is the year we’ve seen the first prototypes, like natural language search or AI reviews. I found 11 publisher deals with LLM developers in 2024, as the traditional media landscape has continued to atrophy: Licensing might not turn publishing into a flaming hot industry again, but it throws a lifeline to starving companies.

In 2024, I expected many companies to focus more on organic growth channels like SEO, content marketing, social, podcasting and email nurturing. And indeed, marketing budgets have accelerated their decline after the pandemic from 11% in 2020 to 7.7% in 2024 of total revenue, leaving less room for advertising. In November 2024, the CMO survey found that advertising sees the lowest spend growth while brand building and product marketing gains the most. In September 2023, Google’s Bard got access to Gmail. I tried it out, and it was terrible. Hallucinations left and right. Google sits on a treasure trove of data as it owns Android, YouTube, Gmail, Maps and is one of the two most used one-tap authentication solutions next to Apple. Microsoft has Outlook, GitHub, Linkedin, Edge, Skype and more. None of the two companies – or any company, for that matter – are able to successfully integrate their user data with powerful AI agents. I have high hopes for 2025, though. Google has continued to prioritize human content in the search results by giving forum content a boost, but I haven’t noticed the improvement I expected in 2024. My expectation was that Google could use the Reddit API to prioritize threads based on age, upvotes and Karma of contributors. That hasn’t happened. We’re still seeing questionable forum content in the search results. Well, I couldn’t have been more wrong. My reasoning was that Google wouldn’t launch AI Snapshot, as they were called before the public release, since they’re too disruptive to their core advertising business model unless a competitor puts enough pressure on them. That seems to have happened because AI Overviews launched in May 2024. You could argue I’m right because they launched with lots of flaws and caused Google another PR headache. But I’ll take an L on this one since there is no clear evidence. Source I assumed more creators would make more money in 2024 as the field matures and more platforms share revenue. The opposite happened. There are 27 million creators in the US, and 44% say creating is their full-time job.1 But the top 1% of creators make up over 50% of the revenue. 3% of YouTube creators get 85% of the views. The top 1% of podcasts get 99% of downloads.2 The inequality within the creator economy is staggering, and there is no improvement in sight. Every year, I try to stretch my predictions to scratch the limits of what’s possible and underline my convictions.

Title: Nvidia Stock May Rise As Its Stealth AI Cloud Rivals Big Customers’

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang holds a Grace Blackwell NVLink72 as he delivers a keynote address at the ... [+] Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 6, 2025. Gadgets, robots and vehicles imbued with artificial intelligence will once again vie for attention at the Consumer Electronics Show, as vendors behind the scenes will seek ways to deal with tariffs threatened by US President-elect Donald Trump. The annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) opens formally in Las Vegas on January 7, 2025, but preceding days are packed with product announcements. (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images) Updated, Jan. 7, 2025: This post has been adjusted to include numbers from Nvidia's full day of trading. On January 6, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote speech at the 2025 Consumer Electronics Show made a series of what looked to me like relatively small announcements — including products for industries such as robotics, cars, and gaming, according to the Wall Street Journal. Are these mini-announcements a diversion? One analyst thinks the biggest news could be Nvidia’s strategy to compete with cloud services customers — Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet — by building its own AI cloud, noted Investor’s Business Daily. Nvidia — whose shares rose almost 4% in pre-market trading and closed down 9.3% by the end of January 7 — is excited about the opportunity to provide software for robotics developers. "The ChatGPT moment for robotics is coming,” Huang told CES attendees, according to IBD. "Like large language models, world foundation models are fundamental to advancing robot and AV development, yet not all developers have the expertise and resources to train their own. We created Cosmos to democratize physical AI and put general robotics in reach of every developer," he added. An Nvidia spokesperson I contacted declined to comment. If there is one thing I learned in writing my latest book, Brain Rush, it is this: Nvidia’s future depends heavily on collaboration with companies closer to technology end-users. That’s because Nvidia — which designs chips and builds software for developers — can only enjoy rapid growth by motivating companies closer to end-users — such as chip fabricators, cloud services providers, enterprise software companies, and management consultants — to make Nvidia’s products part of a system that businesses and consumers find valuable. Nvidia’s CES product announcements are aimed at strengthening such partnerships. Here are the industries these announcements aim to enhance: While Nvidia did not make an announcement about this at CES, the biggest news from the company could be a strategy to compete with its cloud services customers who account for most of Nvidia’s growth. Indeed one analyst detected Nvidia’s growing appetite for leased data center capacity equipped for AI processing. Such AI data centers would “rent out servers powered by its own chips as well as host its AI software development platform,” noted Investor’s Business Daily. The analyst sees Nvidia’s push into cloud computing as a New Year’s surprise. “We see the potential for Nvidia to accelerate its data center leasing in 2025 as it looks to procure more capacity that can be used for its 'AI cloud,' with the potential for Nvidia to outpace its hyperscale peers in data center leasing in 2025,” noted TD Cowen analyst Michael Elias in a report featured by IBD. In addition to looking for more data center capacity in other deals, Elias noted an “apparent large leasing deal between Nvidia and Digital Realty for data center capacity in Northern Virginia,” IBD reported. Nvidia’s AI Cloud would compete with so-called Neoclouds — AI processing cloud services from the likes of CoreWeave, Lambda, Crusoe, Vultr and Together AI, noted IBD — as well as Nvidia’s biggest AI chip customers Amazon and Microsoft, wrote Elias. By building its own neocloud, Nvidia could take more profit from a fast-growing industry sector. Nvidia — which now distributes its AI software by leasing it through AWS — could boost its profits by operating its own cloud. AI neoclouds are expected to grow at a 100% compound annual rate from $4 billion last year to $32 billion by 2027, according to Pitchbook. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s cloud customers are trying to buy more AI chips from rivals and build their own custom chips. For example, in addition to buying Blackwell chips from Nvidia, hyperscalers are buying AI processors from Broadcom and Marvell Technologies as well as designing their own custom AI accelerators and trying to sell them to OpenAI, Apple and Meta Platforms, IBD reported. Nvidia stock may be heading up. Based on 40 Wall Street analysts offering 12-month price targets, Nvidia stock would need to rise 18.5% to reach the average forecast of $135 per share, noted TipRanks. Here are comments from less- and more-bullish analysts: To me the key questions for investors are: How much revenue could Nvidia's AI cloud generate? Will Nvidia’s hyperscaler clients buy less from Nvidia? My guess is Huang expects Nvidia’s AI cloud service will make the company better off. One Community. Many Voices.

Wall Street was looking at a muted open Tuesday after the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed higher for a second straight session. Tech stocks, particularly chip names, drove the buying. Nvidia rose nearly 3.5% on Monday to a record close. The Club stock added another 2% early Tuesday, the morning after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's big keynote address at the annual CES conference in Las Vegas. 2. It's hard to grasp all the new AI use cases that Jensen laid out at CES on Monday night. He touted artificial intelligent agents that can complete tasks and advancements in "physical AI" with robotics, including launching a new real-world foundation model called Cosmos. He also unveiled a new video game chip that uses AI to render graphics, which might be the spark the AI PC movement needs to catch on. 3. Jensen also talked up Nvidia's bright future in self-driving cars, which includes a technology partnership with Toyota on its next-generation vehicles. Shares of Toyota, the world's biggest automaker by sales, rose 2% on the news. Autonomous semitruck player Aurora Innovation shares soared more than 35% on its Nvidia collab.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg and Jensen Huang jointly became $28 billion richer in 3 days as AI buzz reignites
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-jensen-huang-meta-nvidia-stock-wealth-ai-billionaires-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-07T12:46:32Z
Full Content:
Mark Zuckerberg and Jensen Huang have jointly grown $28 billion richer in just the first three trading days of this year, meaning they're worth $350 billion combined — more than Bank of America. The Meta CEO has gained about $15 billion this year, while the Nvidia CEO's wealth has risen by about $13 billion. Their flying start has made them the biggest wealth gainers on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index so far in 2025, but other big names in tech aren't far behind. Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao was up about $12 billion at Monday's close, followed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos with an $8 billion increase, and Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, up about $6 billion each. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk was next on the list at $5 billion in the green. Zuckerberg and Huang's combined gain of $28 billion accounts for nearly half of the net $61 billion increase for the world's 20 richest people in 2025. The pair's wealth jump reflects a nearly 8% advance in Meta stock and an 11% rise for Nvidia this year. Meta shares benefited from Wall Street analysts raising their price targets. Nvidia climbed on signs of strong demand for microchips and anticipation for Huang's keynote speech at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Monday. The Nvidia chief revealed new chips and a $3,000 AI supercomputer named Digits. He also announced partnerships in robotics, self-driving cars, and more independent or "agentic" AI. Zuckerberg and Huang's personal fortunes grew by about $79 billion and $70 billion respectively last year, trailing only Elon Musk's $203 billion gain by Bloomberg's estimates. The world's 20 richest people grew a combined $702 billion wealthier last year, lifting their net worth to above $3 trillion — a figure that rivals Microsoft's market value of $3.2 trillion. Tech leaders including Meta, Nvidia, Tesla, Amazon, and Alphabet have surged in recent years, supercharging the wealth of their biggest shareholders, as investors bet they'll play pivotal roles in the AI revolution and capture a big chunk of the profits generated.

Title: Quest Pro Is Now Officially Discontinued
URL: https://www.uploadvr.com/quest-pro-officially-discontinued/
Time Published: 2025-01-06T23:18:33Z
Full Content:
Quest Pro is no longer available to buy from Meta, though stock is still available at some retailers. Meta announced the retirement of both Quest 2 and Quest Pro at its Connect conference back in September, saying that the two headsets will no longer be available when stock runs out or at the end of the year, whichever comes first. For Quest 2, stock ran out within a few weeks of Connect. For Quest Pro, it appears the other clause applied. With the arrival of the new year, the headset's page on Meta's website has been replaced with a "Meta Quest Pro is no longer available" notice, alongside an image and price of Quest 3, Meta's new highest-end offering. With Quest 2, Quest Pro, and the 128GB model of Quest 3 gone, Meta's headset lineup has been simplified to: After Quest 2 became the first mainstream VR headset, Meta hoped it could build on this success by introducing a high-end Quest to serve enthusiasts and businesses. Quest Pro launched in late 2022 at $1500. It featured Meta's first pancake lenses, QD-LCD displays with Mini-LED local dimming, eye tracking, face tracking, a curved battery in the rear of the strap, and the ringless self-tracking Touch Pro controllers. In many ways Quest Pro was a pioneering headset. But in others it was severely lacking, given its price. By the time Quest Pro launched, leaks of a Quest 3 arriving a year later with a twice as powerful GPU at half the price had already emerged, severely dampening the headset's value proposition. Further, Quest Pro's underwhelming resolution, grainy passthrough, lack of ability to generate a scene mesh for mixed reality, and Meta’s cartoonish avatars not being detailed enough to do the face tracking sensors justice led to mixed-at-best reviews. Just four months after Quest Pro launched Meta cut its price from $1500 to $1000. This kind of price cut so soon after launch was unprecedented, and strongly suggests the headset vastly missed its launch sales targets. By around a year after launch Meta was giving away Quest Pro headsets to Roblox creators, when giving them a Quest 2 would have been perfectly fine. And last year Meta removed the whiteboard, which was designed around the pressure-sensitive stylus tips of Quest Pro's controllers, from Horizon Workrooms. Multiple developers have told UploadVR they see only a tiny fraction of their user base on Quest Pro. As such, almost no Quest game developers took the time to add support for its eye-tracked foveated rendering. With Quest Pro off the market, Meta no longer sells any headsets with eye tracking or face tracking.

Title: Nvidia Stock Pops 4%—On Track For Record Close Ahead Of Jensen Huang CES Keynote

Nvidia added some $140 billion in market value Monday ahead of a key speech from its centibillionaire CEO Jensen Huang, briefly reclaiming the mantle as the most valuable company on earth for the unquestioned leader of the generative artificial intelligence wave. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a speech last June. Shares of Nvidia climbed 3.4% to $149.43 per share, besting their previous record close of $148.88 set Nov. 7. The Monday surge sent Nvidia’s market capitalization to as high as $3.73 trillion, briefly eclipsing the market cap of Apple before the iPhone maker narrowly took back its title later in the afternoon — Nvidia is less than $40 billion away from its first market close as the world’s highest valued company since Nov. 25, according to YCharts data. The Nvidia rally came amid a broader rally in U.S. technology stocks — the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose more than 1% to a 2025 high — and a global spike in share prices of other players in the semiconductor chip industry, as shares of Netherlands-based ASML, Taiwan-based TSMC and UK-based Arm Holdings gained at least 4% apiece. Semiconductor stocks received a boost from record fourth quarter revenue data from the Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn, a bullish signal for to-be-reported Q4 data for Nvidia and other AI companies. Also helping Nvidia and its peers was the Washington Post reporting President-elect Donald Trump’s tariffs will initially target sectors other than semiconductors, good news for an industry heavily reliant on the global supply chain for designing and manufacturing the chips powering technology from iPhones to ChatGPT, OpenAI’s generative AI chatbot (Trump denied the report). Huang will deliver Monday’s keynote address at the CES 2025 technology conference beginning at approximately 6:30 p.m. EST. The speech should include “reassuring updates” on the company’s Blackwell and Rubin graphics processing unit systems, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya wrote in a recent note to clients, predicting Huang’s speech will be a “positive catalyst” for the stock. Rosenblatt analysts Kevin Cassidy and Hans Mosesmann concurred they expect to see a “bullish Jensen Huang” on Monday, laying out a case for Nvidia’s competitive advantage in addressing the full-stack of technology needed to power AI. Nvidia designs a majority of the custom semiconductor chips powering generative AI systems, and its notable clientele includes Amazon, Meta, OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI. Founded in 1993 by Huang and two other engineers, Nvidia spent much of its existence best known for its video games graphics business before rising to fame as the face of the 2020s AI boom. No company has ever achieved a $4 trillion valuation, though Apple and Nvidia are both within 10% of hitting the milestone. 786%. That’s how much Nvidia’s share price has risen since Nov. 30, 2022, the launch of ChatGPT. An $1,000 investment in Nvidia at that time is now worth nearly $9,000. Huang’s net worth rose by about $5 billion Monday, the third most of any billionaire, according to our real-time net worth tracker. Huang’s $131 billion fortune makes him the ninth-richest person on the planet, rising more than twentyfold over the last five years. Most of Huang’s net worth comes from his 3.5% stake in Nvidia, the largest of any individual. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Meta, Snap Enjoy Wall Street Surge as TikTok Ban Looms

Stock prices for Snapchat and Instagram’s parent companies have jumped as chief competitor TikTok approaches its ban date Snapchat parent Snap Inc. and Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, saw their recent Wall Street hot streak continue Monday, as tech companies including Google-owned YouTube stand to benefit the most from TikTok’s looming ban set for Jan. 19. By midday Monday, Snap’s stock was up 3.4% to $12.38 per share. Those gains added to Snap’s recent run, with the company, led by CEO Evan Spiegel, seeing its stock price jump 15% in the past week. Snap’s stock was given a “buy” rating by Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris on Friday, with Morris projecting Snapchat added 8 million daily users between October and December. Those user gains would push Snapchat to 451 million daily users by the end of Q4. Snap is expected to share its Q4 report in early February. Meta, meanwhile, has enjoyed more modest gains — its stock price is up 2.7% on Monday, hitting $619.31 per share, and has increased 5.2% in the past week. And Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, has made similar gains. Alphabet’s stock is up 3% on Monday to $198.93 per share, and its share price is up about 4.5% in the past week. The recent gains for those tech giants indicates investors could be looking to put their money into platforms that would benefit from TikTok being booted from the U.S. The popular app, owned by Beijing-based Bytedance, is set to be banned from the States on Jan. 19 — one day before president-elect Donald Trump takes office. The TikTok ban was initially floated during Trump’s first administration, before ultimately being passed by Congress and signed into law by President Joe Biden in April. The chief concern U.S. lawmakers have with TikTok is that it doubles as a spyware app for the Chinese government; TikTok, according to Chinese law, is required to share user data with China’s communist government, if it is asked to do so. Trump has since changed his tune on supporting a TikTok ban, saying last year that he’d like to “save” the app. And last month, Trump reiterated he would like to keep TikTok in the U.S. He said he’d “take a look” at saving TikTok, noting he had a “warm spot” in his heart for it because it helped get young people to vote for him. TikTok has been scrambling to find a legal remedy to keep its app in the U.S. as its ban date approaches. In mid-December, The U.S. Supreme Court said it would listen to arguments from TikTok on why it should block the law behind the ban. That crucial hearing is set for Friday.

A 14-day trial for premium features. 55+ tools.Free access for core features. Backlinko readers get unlimitedaccess for 14 days. 55+ tools. Boost SEO results with powerful keyword research Written by Michael Ofei Want to know the most effective ecommerce growth strategy? I studied successful online stores to find out what works best. While every store’s path is unique, clear patterns emerged. Here are some examples: Whether your goal is to do $1M or $100M, it comes from executing the fundamentals. I’ve distilled this guide to the five most impactful growth strategies, including: Let’s start with the most important one. Most ecommerce failures share one root cause: creating products nobody wants. Or products that are okay but never really get traction. You follow trends. Copy competitors. Trust your gut. Then invest thousands in inventory and marketing, hoping customers will buy. The solution? Talk to your customers. One honest conversation today could prevent massive product failures tomorrow. These chats reveal opportunities like: Conversations also build relationships. They turn customers into fans who drive growth through word-of-mouth. By talking to customers, founders Aaron Spivak and Lior Ohayon turned $4,000 into $48M in 48 months. For example, when summer sales dropped, they scheduled customer calls. The feedback was clear: “We love the blanket, but we’re sweating. It’s in storage until winter.” – Aaron Spivak That single insight led to their breakthrough “ice fabric” technology, which: The entrepreneurs continued talking to customers to inform product development. “When people ask what our marketing hack is or which agency we worked with, they miss the point. We had 3,000 people on the phone tell us exactly what they wanted. That’s the real secret.” – Aaron Spivak It’s easy to overthink product research. But Hush proved that you just need to begin talking to customers. Here’s a simple process to get started: The goal is to build such deep customer understanding that product failures become nearly impossible. When we consume 6 hours of content daily, attention is the most valuable currency in business. Storytelling is how you earn it. Why? Stories stick. You may not remember product specs, but you likely recall Sara Blakely cutting the feet off her pantyhose to create Spanx. Or Patagonia’s founder testing gear on mountain expeditions. Most brands miss by showing only the highlight reel—the wins, the perfect moments, and the polished content. Telling raw, relatable stories is how you build a lasting brand. In 2018, Jake Karls and his co-founders launched Mid Day Squares with a radical commitment to transparency. They documented everything about building the company—from production line disasters to legal battles to funding negotiations. Mid Day Sqaures unconventional approach involved: “When people ask what’s our marketing hack or which agency we worked with, they’re missing the point. Building in public and sharing our authentic story turned customers into fans who felt like they were buying from friends.” – Jake Karls Mid Day Squares grew to over $20 million in revenue. And Jake attributes much of their success to creative content. But brand storytelling isn’t just for founder-led content. When Rachel Wilde started TBH Skincare, she took a different approach to content marketing. In addition to founder stories, she created content on real customer experiences. It focused on honest education about acne treatment. “I always say start with the customer. Understand what they want, and hit them with the right with the right message in the right place at the right time.” – Rachel Wilde This customer-first storytelling shaped every aspect of their content, including: They allocated 80% of the marketing budget to content creation. It built a storytelling engine that helped customers see themselves in the products. And it worked. TBH Skincare grew to $14M ($22M AUD) in four years. Before investing in content, identify what makes your brand relatable. Here are some best practices to get started: Read more: What is Content Marketing? Complete Beginners Guide When you nail your brand’s narrative, you create compelling organic content. But that’s just the beginning. You’re also building marketing assets that drive results across every channel. Your content becomes fuel for: “Most brands create different content for each marketing channel. We just document our journey and then adapt those stories for different platforms. It’s more authentic and way more efficient.” – Jake Karls The TBH Skincare team has found authentic stories outperform traditional ads across every channel. “When you have a piece of content that really resonates with people, you can use it everywhere. Our best-performing ads weren’t planned campaigns—they were real moments we captured and then amplified.” – Rachel Wilde The lesson? View storytelling as the key to better marketing. It’ll boost all your other channels. Every day, billions of people tell Google exactly what they want to buy. Capturing this traffic isn’t cheap or easy—but it’s steady. Paid search gives instant traffic but needs constant investment. Organic search is free but takes time to build up. Together, they drive consistent sales. Read more: SEO vs. SEM: What’s the Difference? When MX Store, Australia’s largest online motorcycle parts retailer, first tried Google Ads, their approach was typical. Broad keywords. Generic ads. Homepage traffic. Like throwing spaghetti at a wall and hoping something sticks. So they shifted their approach—led by marketing director Dan Turner. “The key is perfect alignment. Your keyword matches the intent, your ad matches the keyword, and your landing page matches the ad. No disconnects.” – Dan Turner Here’s exactly what they changed: The result? A consistent 10x return on ad spend (ROAS). Before you spend a dollar on ads, understand your profit. Then, analyzing your competitors and keyword research follows. Work out how much you can spend to get a customer while making a profit. Without this calculation, you risk burning your ad budget on dud campaigns. To avoid this mistake, note three metrics: Here’s an example of the math: The maximum CAC calculation is $50 profit ÷ 3 = $16.67 maximum ad spend per customer. With a 2% conversion rate, you can’t spend over $16.67 to acquire a customer while keeping campaigns profitable. Keyword research answers a simple question: are people searching for what you’re selling? Start by Googling your products to see what ads are displaying. For example, here’s what the ads look like for “pendulum lights.” There are lots of ads, which implies they’re working. You could theoretically follow this simple process of Googling, observing, and copying. But, to reduce wasted budget, use a tool like Semrush. It’ll help you understand the demand and cost for profitable keywords. Bonus: Here’s a link to a 14-day trial on a Semrush Pro subscription. That should give you enough time to plan your search marketing campaigns. The first thing to do is check the keyword data. Semrush’s Keyword Overview tool shows that pendulum lights are searched 320 times a month. And the CPC is $0.77. This is enough data to test a campaign. But if you want even more validation, spy on your competitor’s ads. Following the breadcrumbs of how your competitors do ads can save you months of time and money. Staying with the lighting example, Lumens is a competitor. According to Semrush’s Advertising Research tool, Lumens is attracting over 27k monthly users from ads. This tells us that they’re investing pretty aggressively in Google Ads. And they’ve likely done the work of testing and failing. To validate this, you can check Lumens ads history. For instance, they’ve been bidding on “outdoor wall lighting” for seven months straight. Meaning: they’re seeing enough sales to continue the campaign. You can see what the ad looks like in Semrush. And Lumens has been tweaking their copy each month. Using this data drastically increases your chances of successful ads.

So you want to maximize their SEO potential. For product pages: Further reading: 20 Effective Product Page Examples For category pages: For inspiration, check out Ruggable’s “clean rugs” category page. You don’t need to address every technical detail. Start with: Speed is especially important for ecommerce. In 2019, eBay did a sitewide initiative to improve performance. Every 100-millisecond improvement led to a 0.5% increase in “Add to Cart.” Further reading: Ecommerce SEO: 6 Proven Strategies to Rank Higher Begin with: Test everything. Double down on what works. Cut what doesn’t. Every dollar should drive immediate sales (paid) or build long-term assets (organic). The top brands drive 30-50% of their revenue through email marketing. These email programs succeed by connecting three foundations we’ve covered: But there’s a fourth element that ties everything together: systematic execution. Let’s explore how to build an email program that turns subscribers into customers—and customers into repeat buyers. Note: The best practices I’m about to share are inspired by Boyuan Zhao, an email and SMS consultant for Shopify brands. I recommend checking out his free four-hour training on YouTube. It’s some of the best content I’ve seen on email marketing. Your email list isn’t just a number. “Most brands obsess over list size. But I’ve found that smaller, engaged lists consistently outperform massive, unengaged ones.” – Boyuan Zhao Large lists built through aggressive tactics (giveaways, lead magnets, etc.) often convert at 1-2%. Meanwhile, carefully grown lists using targeted pop-ups and organic signups can hit 8-15% conversion rates. The math is simple: Plus, better engagement means higher deliverability. Which means more of your emails actually reach inboxes. Start by optimizing your signup forms: Further reading: Email Marketing: The Definitive Guide You likely have a decent welcome series, abandoned cart emails, and a newsletter. But to hit 50% attributed revenue to email, you need to think differently. There are two shifts you need to make this happen. “The brands consistently driving 50% of revenue through email aren’t doing anything revolutionary. They’re just incredibly systematic about execution.” – Boyuan Zhao This means: The results compound over time. How many emails are in your sequences? Probably too many. “I’ve found that a well-executed 3-email sequence often outperforms complex 10-email flows. It’s not about the number of touchpoints. It’s about delivering the right message at the right time.” – Boyuan Zhao Instead of building complex automations, focus on the fundamentals: Weave authentic brand storytelling into your automations and relentlessly test, test, test. Do this, and you’re well on your way to more sales. Even if you have winning products and amazing marketing, you can fail if your operations suck. In 2023, founders Raquel and Adam Bouris of fragrance brand Who Is Elijah learned two expensive lessons about business. First, their discovery set promotion seemed like a slam dunk: sell fragrance samples for $1 plus shipping. They sold 6,000 sets in 24 hours. “Sales looked great because thousands and thousands a week were going out.” – Adam Bouris But the math told a different story. Customers paid $1 plus $10 shipping. The actual shipping cost was $7-12 per unit. Add production, logistics, and overhead costs. The result? A 60% loss on every order. Ouch. “We would’ve been better off turning the website off.” – Adam Bouris Meanwhile, their team had grown from 28 to 44 people, but profits weren’t following. Their initial approach followed conventional wisdom: Despite growing revenue, operational costs were suffocating the business. “One of the biggest problems founders make is they worry about the now instead of what’s on the other side of that decision. We were hiring people to fix problems six months away. That’s so stupid.” – Adam Bouris Who Is Elijah made a complete operational reset, including two critical changes: Profitability improved. They also became more agile and innovative. “I learned how to be a CFO the hard way, but I’m glad that I went through the pain.” – Adam Bouris You can build efficient operations without an MBA or years of corporate experience. It starts with digging into four areas. To understand your profitability create a system for tracking your unit economics. Start with the three numbers that matter most: 1. Revenue per order 2. Direct costs per order 3. Operating costs per order This is a starting point. The rest of your numbers (tools, complex calculations, etc.) can come later. Pro tip: Use a tool like Cin7 to automate this tracking. The investment pays for itself by identifying profit leaks. When problems arise, the tendency is to: Instead, step back and design systems that prevent future issues. Start with your three most time-consuming processes, e.g., order fulfillment, customer services, and inventory management. For each process: Your supply chain impacts everything: cash flow, customer satisfaction, and profitability. Here’s how to optimize it: First, map your current supply chain: Then, negotiate better terms. Here’s an email template: Hi [Name], We’ve been working together for [X months/years] and have purchased [$ amount] of inventory during this time. I’d like to discuss ways we can grow our partnership. Specifically, I’d like to explore: 1. Volume-based discounts 2. Extended payment terms (Net-30 or Net-60) 3. Priority shipping/fulfillment Could we schedule a quick call next week? Best, [Your name] Before adding employees, see what tasks you can automate. Here are some processes to tackle first: You don’t need to do everything at once. Start by answering these questions: Pick the area that needs the most work. Focus there first.

Title: Is DOGE Real? - For Government Services Companies, Very Much So

WASHINGTON, DC - The dome of the U.S. Capitol is seen beyond a snow man on the national mall on ... [+] January 16, 2024. (Photo by Kent Nishimura/Getty Images) Much ink (or in today’s world, electrons and pixels), has been expended discussing the “Department of Government Efficiency” to be formed in the incoming Presidential administration. Popularly known as “DOGE” and headed by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the moniker is a not so subtle reference to a cryptocurrency supported by Musk. The Doge was also, in medieval times, the chief magistrate of city-states such as Venice and Genoa, and acted as a judge to decide questions brought before a court of justice. DOGE will not be a department, but actually an advisory commission, of which there are many serving various Departments of the US government. (Most of these, doubtlessly, will be targets for elimination by the commission). To be an actual Department, such as Defense or Treasury, would require an act of Congress. However, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) announced plans in November of last year to form a Subcommittee to work with DOGE to achieve its goals. This Subcommittee will be chaired by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA). The two tech billionaires leading DOGE have at various times announced multiple goals and actions. Musk has put forth the expectation that the Federal budget would be reduced by $2 Trillion. Ramaswamy has stated that entire Departments might be eliminated and as much as three quarters of the Federal workforce could be let go. Musk has proposed eliminating over 300 of the 400 plus Federal agencies. It is not hard to determine how the $2 Trillion reduction goal was set. The 2024 Federal budget was roughly $6.8 Trillion in overall spending while revenues (derived primarily from personal and corporate income taxes, payroll taxes, custom duties and sales/excise taxes) was only $4.9 Trillion, yielding a $1.9 Trillion annual budget deficit. And that deficit is expected to grow, according to the Congressional Budget Office, to $2.6 Trillion by 2034. In other words, if DOGE could achieve its goals, the budget would be balanced, something that has not occurred since 2001, regardless of the political party in power. Pres. Ronald Reagan walking & giving thumbs up gesture on S. Lawn after returning from MA. (Photo ... [+] by Cynthia Johnson/Getty Images) Despite the aggressive pronouncements, the reality of reducing government spending through blue-ribbon advisory commissions dates back to Theodore Roosevelt, with little sustained impact. Most notable in the recent past was Ronald Reagan’s Grace Commission, led by industrial CEO Peter Grace. In 1982, Reagan coined the phrase “Drain the Swamp” and encouraged the Commission to “Be bold... work like tireless bloodhounds... Don’t leave any stone unturned in your search to root out inefficiency.” The Grace Commission produced a 47 volume report that, if implemented, promised a reduction of Federal spending of nearly half a trillion dollars in three years and a paring of the national debt by over $10 Trillion over the next sixteen years. At the end of last year, that debt now sits at $36.22 Trillion. Most of the findings were never enacted due to policy disputes or bureaucratic resistance. Although past commissions might not have achieved their aims, the financial markets are betting otherwise. From the date of the election, November 5, 2024, through December 31, 2024, the stock price of government services providers has slid by as much as 31%. These companies, such as Booz Allen Hamilton, Amentum, CACI, SAIC, Leidos, V2X, Parsons and KBR perform a variety of technical, engineering, or IT services to perform projects in support of Departmental goals. Many of them provide qualified manpower to work on classified projects, having the necessary security clearances. Their revenue is often highly correlated with their qualified employees, and are referred to as “butts in seats” enterprises. HELMAND PROVINCE, AFGHANISTAN - JULY 21: KBR (UK) employees work at a manufacturing plant at the ... [+] Camp Bastion Water Bottling Plant on July 21, 2008. (Photo by Marco Di Lauro/Getty Images) And the falloff in enterprise value has induced second order effects. In late December it was revealed that KBR was a target of an activist investor, Irenic Capital, which had accumulated over 1% of the company’s shares and was advocating for a split of the government services unit from the private sector services unit due to the slower expected growth rate of the former. Irenic estimated that shareholder value could be improved by 50% through such a separation. It is understandable that these companies could experience a drastic slowdown in their revenues. They are engaged on projects which can be delayed or cancelled perhaps more easily and rapidly than cutting Federal employees. When Musk took over Twitter (now renamed X) in 2022, he took the workforce from 8,000 to 1,500, according to statements he made in 2023, or a reduction of roughly 80%. Despite fears that the company’s systems would crash, they continued to function albeit in a reduced form (a subject of continuing controversy), and that realization set off a chain reaction in Silicon Valley. Almost instantly, the tech CEO mindset changed from one of scarcity and competition for talent (providing housing, transportation, in-office amenities such as food, coffee baristas and kombucha on tap) to attract qualified software engineers, to one of surplus and excess. Companies such as Meta, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple slashed over 165,000 jobs in 2022, 263,000 in 2023 and 151,000 in 2024, according to layoffs.fyi. However successful the cost cutting was, X’s market value has now dropped to $9.4 Billion (according to Fidelity Investments) versus the $44 Billion Musk paid for it, due to dissatisfaction with its policies and performance and defections of advertisers and users to other social media platforms. And this is the conundrum that every would be drainer of swamps must face. The “excess” cost that must be eliminated has a sponsor or recipient of its value - many of whom sit in a Congress that has razor slim majorities in its parties. DOGE may not achieve any or all of its goals in reality. The means by which the $2 Trillion reduction is measured is not specified (annually? over time? inflation adjusted?) and it is unclear whether other spending will be needed to offset backlash from affected parties (the Twitter/X problem). But for now the specter of reduced government spending is having a material impact in the expectations of the financial markets for the providers of government services. One Community. Many Voices.

Plus: How Jay Graber Is Making Sure Social Media Upstart Bluesky Never Turns Into Elon Musk’s X Good morning, Tesla isn’t the only EV maker experiencing a post-election rally. Shares of California-based Rivian rallied to one of their best days ever on Friday, surging 24%. The upward trajectory defies initial Wall Street concerns about President-elect Donald Trump’s reported intention to cut a federal subsidy for electric vehicles. But last week the automaker revealed slightly better fourth-quarter car deliveries than analysts expected. Rivian’s stock is up 54% since election day, outperforming every other stock besides Tesla and Palantir. The purchase of most Rivian vehicles qualifies for a $3,750 federal tax credit, but if Trump repeals such a subsidy, it could hurt EV demand and effectively increase the sticker price.

Official merchandise themed for Donald Trump's inauguration may do more than celebrate his second presidency—the funds from such swag could be used to cover Trump’s personal expenses, including legal fees, based on fine print displayed at the bottom of checkout pages. It’s an unusual diversion, campaign finance experts told Forbes. Bitcoin reached an all-time high in 2024, capturing the attention of the world and of one old-school value investor. Here's why Taesik Yoon, a longtime Forbes editor, says he’s bullish on the volatile cryptocurrency, and that continued adoption is key. Ed Stack, executive chairman of Dick's Sporting Goods, in the Dick's "House of Sport" in Pittsburgh's Ross Park Mall. Dick’s Sporting Goods owner Ed Stack turned his father’s small business into a juggernaut with a market capitalization of more than $18 billion. He attributes his business success to a series of lessons learned along the way, including to always keep score, study great leaders, pursue a passion and stick to your principles. Billionaire Fernando De Leon’s conglomerate Leon Capital Group is estimated to be worth nearly $3 billion, but growing up, he lived in poverty in Mexico and crossed the U.S. border daily to go to school in Texas. “I’m what Donald Trump calls an ‘anchor baby,’” he says, “but a high tax-paying anchor baby.” Roughly a quarter of De Leon’s estimated $2.8 billion fortune is now in residential and industrial real estate, mostly in growing Sun Belt cities. London-based payments unicorn Checkout was once the most valuable startup in Europe, with a $40 billion valuation, but its revenues have slumped after cutting its contract with Binance over money laundering concerns. The troubled crypto exchange at one point was Checkout’s largest customer, and corporate filings reveal the London-based fintech’s revenues dropped 16% to $212 million. The House voted Friday to reelect Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.) as their Speaker after a tight contest following pushback from a small but influential group of Republicans. President-elect Donald Trump endorsed Johnson earlier in the week and reportedly spoke to several members who wound up changing their votes. Trump’s guilty verdict on 34 felony counts in New York will stand after a judge ruled against throwing out the verdict, keeping one of the only remaining criminal cases against Trump alive. Judge Juan Merchan set the sentencing for just 10 days before Trump’s inauguration, but made clear he does not plan to sentence Trump to any prison time. The president-elect criticized the decision on social media over the weekend, saying no president had ever been treated “so evilly and illegally,” and denouncing the New York judicial system. President-elect Donald Trump indicated his continued support for TikTok last week, but his incoming administration’s ability to stop or even pause the federal ban is limited. The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in the TikTok case this Friday, and it’s expected they’ll issue a quick ruling on whether or not the law should be upheld by the time it’s due to take effect January 19. After much back and forth, the Corporate Transparency Act could be headed to the Supreme Court after the Department of Justice filed an application to overturn a preliminary injunction temporarily barring the government from enforcing beneficial ownership information reporting. It’s meant a lot of whiplash for business owners and advisors about whether or not they need to report, and if so, when—but the status quo for now continues to be wait-and-see. Kimberly White/Stringer/Getty Images TOPLINE Since Elon Musk torpedoed Twitter, its rival Bluesky has seen a stunning surge. Bluesky began as an open source research project at Twitter helmed by open internet evangelist Jay Graber. Graber’s mandate was to build a protocol, a shared language that computers could use to talk to each other, designed specifically for social media. But after Elon Musk bought Twitter, it became clear that Bluesky was no longer on its roadmap. The platform began to transform, facing an advertiser boycott, exodus of users, and eventually a name change to X. So the team that made the protocol spun up a quick app, just to show how it might be used. They launched it as an invite-only social network in 2023. Since its launch, Bluesky has seen unusual success: It raised a modest $15 million Series A round in October, when it had 13 million users, and since then, its user base has nearly doubled to more than 25 million. The app has panicked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose own Twitter competitor, Threads, has rushed to copy many of its features. But Bluesky is a company with investors who want to make money. And that could someday clash with Graber’s user-first approach to social media: To put the people using Bluesky in control of its central features. In giving power to the people, Bluesky has so far eschewed the strategy that other social platforms have used to make billions of dollars: collecting troves of intimate data about their users, and then letting advertisers target them based on that data. At least today, Bluesky is fully public, and its user data is available to people outside the company, so there’s no secret sauce for advertisers to pay for. WHY IT MATTERS “If Bluesky’s model is successful and other companies adopt Graber's protocol, it could change the future of social media,” says Forbes senior writer Richard Nieva. “Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter illustrated how fragile the social media ecosystem can be. Decentralizing it can be a form of ‘billionaire-proofing’ the medium, as Graber puts it, for the long term.” MORE How Elon Musk Muzzled Government Employees From Talking About xAI’s New Supercomputer Shares of alcohol makers and distributors fell Friday after Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called on Congress to update warning labels on alcoholic beverages to include cancer risks. Alcohol is the third-leading preventable cause of cancer behind tobacco and obesity, according to Murthy: Around $450 million: The amount of market capitalization that the producer of Modelo and Corona beers lost after the announcement Only 45%: The share of American adults who know of the possible cancer risks of alcohol 100,000: The estimated number of annual alcohol-related cancer cases in the U.S. The job market is at a crossroads, and it’s critical for workers to be resilient and adaptable. A few key labor market trends to watch out for in 2025 include the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence, a full return to the office at some companies and the growing practice of skills-based hiring. There is also more demand for skilled trades, which is opening up new opportunities and challenging long-held assumptions about career success.

Title: Meta Officially Discontinues Quest Pro, Its First (and most expensive) Mixed Reality Headset
URL: https://www.roadtovr.com/meta-discontinues-quest-pro/
Time Published: 2025-01-06T11:49:54Z
Full Content:
Meta has officially discontinued Quest Pro, the company’s first mixed reality headset. Meta announced back in September that it was winding down Quest 2 and Quest Pro sales. At the time, the company said remaining stock would be sold through the end of the year or until they ran out, whichever came first. Now, in place of the Quest Pro order page, Meta is suggesting users to buy Quest 3 “for the ultimate mixed reality experience and premium comfort.” You can still buy Quest Pro’s ‘Touch Pro’ controllers however, as they support Quest 2 and above. Released in 2022 at the eye-water price of $1,500, Meta hoped to use the headset to kickstart its mixed reality ambitions among consumers, as it was the first to offer color-passthrough, pancake lenses, and both face and eye-tracking—coming in strong contrast to the company’s other offering at the time, Quest 2. Nearly a year after launch, it was apparent the Pro-level headset wasn’t appealing to users nearly to the degree Meta had initially hoped, prompting the company to knock Quest Pro down to $1,000. To complicate matters, high initial pricing of Quest Pro put a strain on developers, which resulted in very few compelling MR experiences out of the gate. It was clear what was needed was a more accessible headset. In October 2023, Meta released Quest 3, which housed much of the tech seen in Quest Pro—minus face and eye-tracking, and at the starting price of $499. Clamping down yet further on price-performance, Meta released Quest 3S a year later, which houses the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset as Quest 3, although including the same cost-saving Fresnel lenses and displays as Quest 2—marking the company’s most energetic push to capitalize on its mixed reality ambitions. While Meta’s strategy to capture the console price-point with Quest has been a winning strategy thus far, what’s uncertain is whether the company will head back into the ‘Pro’ pricing structure anytime soon. The Information reported earlier last year that Meta was cancelling a potential Quest Pro follow-up, however Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth partically refuted those claims, noting that “there might be a Quest Pro 2, there might not be. I’m not really telling you, but I will say don’t believe everything you read about what’s been stopped or started.” This article may contain affiliate links.

To complicate matters, high initial pricing of Quest Pro put a strain on developers, which resulted in very few compelling MR experiences out of the gate. Of course. I don't understand why XR companies continue to learn the lesson the hard way. With Quest Pro, you could say that the device was not good enough. But now the Vision Pro, as good a device as you can get with today's tech, faces the same problem. PSVR2 almost died prematurely because of the same thing. "Make it desirable before it is affordable" has always been a stupid strategy. Meta's bottom-up approach is the only way. The reason is simple. Hardware need software to be "desirable" in the first place. And software development has adopted the business model of selling cheap copies to a large number of users. That means hardware designers don't really have a choice. The first question they need to ask is can we sell tens of millions of units. They stopped drinking the the Apple Kool Aid and escaped Apple's reality distortion field but now are really Jonesing that they didn't get some of that sexy eye-tracking! (Consumer) technology that was successful with a rather high price at the beginning, only affordable for a minority, but then used the money from that initial small, but lucrative market to improve tech and lower cost through both larger numbers and production cost reductions: PCs, laptops, telefones, mobile phones, smartphones, CD players, washing maschines, LED lighting, cars, power drills, tape recorder, VHS recorder, refrigerators, Walkman, laser printers, harddisks, SSD, beamer, microwave ovens… (Consumer) technology that became successful by pumping billions into it for more than a decade to push it into households without even making back a fraction of the investment:… And no, gaming consoles were sold with at least some profit for most of their existence, Nintendo never sold at a loss and Sony stopped doing so after the extremely expensive to produce PS3. I believe in XR, because I think that it is genuinely useful and will make people's lives better. But that is also the key to its mass adaption: it first has to become useful/usable (for some, then slowly) for the masses, like all the successful technologies listed above. Claiming that one billionaire's incredible expensive long term bet for more market control and money, enabled by his 60% of Meta's voting shares, would be the only viable approach, is completely ignoring how technology got established so far, blatently ignores the very limited active user numbers the highly subsidized USD 300 Quest collected for those billions, and replaces economic reasoning with wishful thinking. Palmer Luckey wrote a famous blog entry in 2018 titled "Free isn't cheap enough" about VR acceptance by most users. And it wasn't an opinion piece, but based on Oculus research that most people wouldn't use a VR HMD even if they got everything for free. With Quest we saw a ~40% retention rate, so 60% won't use a VR HMD they already paid for. Price is not the primary issue. USD 1500 would have been completely fine for a business oriented Quest Pro, if it had proven to be (sufficiently) useful for its official target audience. It just utterly failed to do so. All the items you mention to prove your point have one thing the Pro never had, enough consumers that wanted the product. That plus the price destroyed it. Only compounded by those low sales not encouraging devs to risk anything on making a killer app. Many of the products I listed could have only dreamt of the est. 50-100K unit sales during their first year that the Quest Pro generated. And there is a decent chance that Meta sold much more Quest Pro than Bigscreen sold Beyond or HTC sold Vive Focus 3. And that's fine, because these serve a niche audience with matching price calculations. But apparently not good enough for Meta. The Quest Pro's problem was that the concept was to create a professional HMD, but the only large enough use case they found was VR conferencing. And while the hardware was okay for that, the software wasn't anywhere near ready to make it actually useful. So almost nobody bought it for business use, and Meta tried to instead also sell it to gamers, where it offered very bad value. Had they clearly stated that gamers should wait for Quest 3, and also given the Pro the time and support that HTC gives their Pro HMDs, it might have found its niche, and established Quest for professional use, where service and reliability outweigh specs and price. But instead Meta dumped it once it didn't immediately deliver success/large numbers, like they did with several Go/Quest business programs before. Sometimes tech simply needs time to establish itself and then grow and mature from an initialy small use case snd user base, and trying to force it to grow faster will just fail. "Meta dumped it once it didn't immediately deliver success/large numbers, like they did with several Go/Quest business programs before." This is now standard corporate procedure now, i.e. Microsoft. Shareholders dislike the idea of niche markets now as corporate greed is the current working model. None of your examples are applicable. It is the symbiotic relationship between software and hardware that makes gaming consoles different from any "consumer electronics". The value of phones, PCs and laptops were clear even in the early days when there were just a few apps. On the other hand, the most common question you hear about the Vison Pro is "what do I do with it". A gaming console — in order to realize its entertainment value — needs a constant supply of games that are very expensive to develop but only have limited value for an individual. "Crowd funding" is the only viable business strategy. I am not saying you have to sell the consoles at a loss. Just do whatever you can to get them into as many hands as possible. Whenever I post whole lists of counter examples to show that your "we must force it into the market now" theories are not how technology is actually established, all I get is that none of them are applicable for unspecified reasons, because VR is somehow special, so known economic rules can't be applied. Also always ignoring that PCs and mobile phones started in the 70s, laptop in the 80s, with initially miniscule use cases and user numbers. Most people saw no practical use in buying one at all for literally decades. And people absolutely have an idea what to do with AVP, and be it only for watching movies. Just not at that weight and that price. How about you come up with examples where any company sucessfully established a technology that most customers at that time/state simply didn't care about, by just ruthlessly burning money for a decade? XR will succeed once it offers enough use for enough people, and until then it will do fine as a niche technology. The example is right in front of your eyes. It's called Quest 3S. It's sold more than PS5 and Xbox combined this holiday season. The kickstart process has completed. The Quest platform is now on a self-sustainable path. The reason Meta hasn't stopped pouring money is because it has bigger prizes in its sight. I don’t know if the path is self-sustainable, though. No one’s arguing that the Quest is the dominant VR platform. Given how much money Meta has put into it, it would be weird if it weren’t. But it’s not clear to me that Meta’s place in the market is so solid that they can’t be dethroned if they turn off the money hose. I have a large library of games on their store thanks to a referral system that I and others frankly abused for hundreds of dollars in free games, but if someone released a better headset and store, it wouldn’t stop me from switching. I might hang onto the Quest until I was bored with those games, but I would still switch. The real driver of sustainable XR adoption in the future is going to be everyday AR, and I’m not convinced that Meta is going to win that battle, or that their $100B investment into the opening act of gaming-focused VR is going to pay off. They’ve been very good at hardware design and aggressive pricing, but their leadership decisions (like the Quest Pro) show a lack of vision, and Meta’s AR efforts are tied to Microsoft, whose software efforts haven’t exactly covered themselves in glory lately. I don't know if Meta will be the eventual winner, but that's a different question. VR gaming is here to stay regardless because a large number of studios have found their footing in this industry thanks mostly to the Meta platform. Whether Meta will cede this ground to another company in the future or not, those developer will still be here with their accumulated knowledge and established reputation. Working with Microsoft ensures failure because as soon as they don't see a 300% on their investment in a couple quarters they will completely pull out. The 2024 Quest 3S may have outsold the four year old PS5 in North America (Xbox sales are way lower, esp. internationally), but the PS5 reached 68mn in lifetime sales by 2024-11, leaving Quest 1/2/3S/3/Pro combined far behind, with much higher retention and follow-up game sales. And while Quest 3S sold better than Quest 3/Pro before (SUCCESS!!!), it sold less than its aging 2020 predecessor sold on Amazon during the 2023 holiday season. I'm fully aware why Meta keeps pouring money into XR, and what bigger prizes they are eying for. It's just very obvious that all their effort so far hasn't gotten them anywhere near to where their platform might be considered a potential threat to the Apple/Google mobile duopoly that those players will inevitably try to extend into XR by leveraging their huge user bases. And time is mostly working against Meta. It's been a threat to Apple and Google enough that they both decided they could not sit on the sidelines anymore. Pretty sure that AndroidXR is mostly a reaction to visionOS, and AVP mostly Tim Cook's decade long attempt to proof that he too can come up with revolutionary products, so his legacy won't be limited to "the great accountant that turned Apple into the first trillion dollar company." Doubt that Meta had a lot to do with it, if anything the lacking mass market acceptance of Quest showed them they didn't need to hurry. Yes but even apple who usually have a good sense and is able to create new trends, sort of didn't met it's usual standards. It seems the potential that enthousiasts see in VR isn't translating well to mortals yet. Sort of like how only nerds, scientists and army could see the point of the first computers. But the actual reality is maybe that it's not even sure that you could jump start a VR market right now by giving headsets away for free and releasing a HL Alyx type of game every month. The issue seems more and more a slow human paradigm shift to vr, than technical or financial reasons. Just think how many of us refused to use cell phones. I could have stayed without one for a long time if there was no sign I was about to be excluded naturaly of social activities. Is there something similar that is forcing people to VR yet ? No, not yet, but I think in maybe 10 or 20 years, something similair will start to happen probably. Well, if you believe human inertia is the main issue, then we can't just wait for this to happen right? Someone has to jumpstart the process. I tried to give my first gen headset to a gamer friend and he didn't want it, for what I consider bullshit reasons. This litteraly put in my face that it's not even guaranted that giving away headsets for free could jumpstart VR. I think John Carmack said something similar that even giving away 20000$ vr light glasses prototypes might not even be enough to jumpstart vr in the way the hype expected it 8 years ago. Because VR already started and is not going away, it just seems that consumer usage rate will increase slower than what we hoped or expected. In 10-20 years the middle class won't have enough money to buy a VR headset. That’s much different than a niche entertainment device. You are talking about a whole technology, computers as we know it. Not fitness goggles Computers were used for much much more than beat saber All of what your describe are slow evolutions of things that started 50 or 100 years ago. For instance, between the gramophone and the CD player, there isn't that much evolution in how it's used. Same between an oven and a microwave oven. Between regular screen, and VR there is a huge paradigm shift, probably even bigger than between books and text on a screen. TL;DR: VR came the same long path as any other technology, and is based on very similar usage patterns, people just don't realize because they forget/don't know/ignore its long winded history. What's special about VR is the high level of immersion thanks to using a display type with head tracking, most of the rest is reusing tech/content from somewhere else. The first head mounted display was shown 1968 by Ivan Sutherland, and that one is literally why we call VR headsets HMD. So that's 56 years ago, and there were stereoscopic multimedia displays before, like the 1962 Sensorama (lacking head tracking) now considered early VR devices. And VR continuously crept forward, first only experimental, then for military, than as business and research tool since the 90's. Only consumer VR is still less than 15 years old, and it was 100% an evolutionary technology enabled by hires phone displays and GPUs running predistortion shaders that allowed using much cheaper lenses that previous HMDs. And the "paradigm shift" is head tracking, which allows for a 360° FoV incl. head turns, which massively increases immersion thanks to being in the world rather than looking at it through a small window. Stereoscopy only matters at close range. We already had 3D games you could run and look around in for more than a quarter of a century, where you turned the camera with the mouse instead of you head. RE4/8 on PSVR2 can be played both flat or in VR, there is no fundamental difference like between fixed text on paper vs changeable text on a screen that allows for many more and different use cases than a book. There is a new generation drawn to VR by viral Gorilla Tag videos on TikTok showing a fun way to spend time with friends, but even they will immediarely realize that this is basically just another type of video game played on a new type of display you strap to your head, which allows for the extra immersion only VR can provide. Everything else is mostly an evolution of previous tech, recycled once again. For example the 2006 Nintendo Wiimote was already an inside-out 5DoF controller, and by adding a second (controller/camera), you could do 6DoF tracking a decade before the Oculus Touch controllers appeared. I have good reasons why I compare the evolution of VR with other consumer electronics, and why I seriously doubt that Meta's pay-to-win strategy of endless subsidizing has a chance to still succeed, let alone would make sense for any other company. A decade after buying Oculus they are short USD ~100bn for less than 1% of Apple's/Google's active user base, with the Quest 3S selling less on Amazon during the last holiday season than the Quest 2 the year before. At this point Meta's best bet seem to be their Ray-Ban smart glasses, with many companies showing similar glasses with integrated displays at CES 2025. Simply because people actually like and buy these, because they consider them useful, without the need to massivey subsidize them. Just like with other technology before. Since we talk about commerical stuff, what matters is when the paradigm shift was made available to consumers more than when it was invented. In this regard, there is 90 years between the gramophone available to consumers and the cd. I can say I had the Razer Hydra, and had first taste of 1:1 tracking, and also toyed with wiimote as a trackir, or that famous paralax track ir video, that make you understand that paralax can have a pop out effect similar to stereoscopy, and also played with the cardboard. Despite all that and knowing the VR is reusing existing technologies, like you could say for all tech by the way, I consider the VR as a paradigm shift made available for consumers, only happened in 2016, with the Vive and Rift. So to me, 8 years is nothing at a human society level for something that changes so much how we interact with virtuality, wich we mostly did only by looking at flast screens until now. So I agree that technically it's just the viewport on the virtual world that is different, this is clear and simple to me as it is to you that it's not a huge technological leap. But psychologically this seems to be huge leap to many people. Either because it's too much virtual intensity, or change too much how they got used to enjoy videogames, or that it seems to nerdy. You could pour billions in that, you couldn't change this type of perception prejudices and inertia in less than 1 human generation probably. I am not beeing negative, and wish it was different, but I am starting to think this is the only rational explanation to how slow it feels it's developping, for something that maybe us tech geeks who always dreamed about that, do not feel it changes that much the paradigm. That's why I think the CD compared to tapes, or smartphone compared to dumb phone, is a bad comparison, because the paradigm shift timeline isn't comparable yet. I've been waiting for VR since the 90's, and when usable HMDs finally appeared a few years ago, I was sure it would take the world by storm, because this was obviously the medium of the future I had been dreaming about for decades. And then I was completely baffled when that didn't happen, and the world just didn't care. I must have demoed VR to hundreds of people, all of which were wowed, but almost none ever got a HMD themselves. Very few even asked later if they could try it again. Instead mobile games, the probably least immersive form of video games with the most simplified input played on a display covering ~6° of the horizontal FoV took over more than 50% of all gaming revenue within a few years, and much more of the total play time. So something didn't work out. I am actually very disappointed that those few who care about VR are mostly interested in games, while for me VR was always primarily a brain enhancement tool. But at some point I realized that the enourmous potential of VR I still have in my head is only loosely related to what is currently possible, or to what most people are looking for from any technology, which is mostly help with practical use cases, and convenience without requiring a lot of effort. I think VR is great because of what I expect it (one day) could do, while most people only look at what it currently actually does, which (unless you value immersion way more than most) isn't a lot besides a wow effect that quickly wears of with miserable ergonomics. So my own positive view includes a lot of projection not really based on the current state of the technology. Which is why I don't see a paradigm shift or even (un-)typical inertia when adapting something new: people have always embraced new technology once it became good enough to improve their lives, and all the technologies listed above were established that way, first by a few willing to go the extra mile, and only later by the masses, once all the rough edges were gone and the use both obvious and effortless. And VR simply isn't there yet, or anywhere close go it. It's still mostly a fancy toy for the more nerdy part of the population with seemingly endless potential, but currently only very limited practical use. The big mistake we inside the VR bubble make is insisting that the already available benefits are enough, when in reality they only matter for a rather small group of future oriented enthusiasts. For the vast majority VR simply doesn't offer enough yet to be worth the hassle. IMHO we are the anomaly, the rest of the world that can't be bothered with VR so far are the ones doing a more realistic cost/benefit evaluation based on their own priorities. We are still in the gramophone phase with a total of ten records availabe that tend to break after a few uses despite the required huge investment in money, effort and space. Still a huge improvement over the wax covered cylinders used in phonographs, but not yet as user friendly as vinyl records with electric amplifiers with speakers, idiot proof as CDs or as convenient as iPods. And for a lot of people VR will only become interesting once it becomes lile Spotify: its just there and works everywhere without ever having to worry what's going on in the background. Yes, the term "paradigm shift" can be applied to different phases depending how you look at it. You could say the paradigm shift is only the moment when behavior of the masses will shift to seemlessly use vr. I was thinking more of the paradigm shift that was available in 2016, were you started to be able to play the same game or some clone of the game, with or without vr. Like for me playing to Pavlov instead of Counter Strike was a no brainer, because it meant like beeing able to paintball or laser game at home. But for some reason what I see as a huge paradigm shift, isn't seen as this for other people, or they do not understand it, I don't know, while the same people would be down playing paintball or laser game instantly. It's like people are thinking but why would I listen to gramphone music at home with shitty sound, while I can listen and see musician playing at the concert all with amazing sound ? Why would I listen to music on a walkman in the street, while I can just think about music in my head when walking, or listen music confortably at home in a sofa ? We probably just forget that this technologies had the same inertia, and we can't say they were wrong thinking that in fact. But anyway, if VR enthousiast or new tech inventors were not sort of delusional, and knew VR would develop this slowly, we would probably had no vr yet, and that can be said about most tech probably. Here’s to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes… the ones who see things differently — they’re not fond of rules… You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can’t do is ignore them because they change things… they push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do. It took 50 years for consoles phones and PCs and other regular screen based devices to get were they are. VR could be just small light glasses with low price, it wouldn't change that it will take time for people to integrate this in their life. If you think about flat panels, many people didn't want one because Yes, it'll take time for VR to be as popular as phones and TVs, but it doesn't mean it can't exist in a meaningful way and bring value to millions of people today. However, someone needs to jumpstart the process, which is exactly what Meta did. You can still buy Quest Pro’s ‘Touch Pro’ controllers however, as they support Quest 2 and above. Thank god. Those were what convinced me as someone coming from PC VR headset with none insight out tracked controllers (Rift CV1 and Valve Index) to even consider a Quest 3. Meta, discontinuing those controllers in the future or even with your next headset would be a big mistake. Just release a Quest 3 premium or Quest 4 with oled screen ASAP… That’s all what matters Quest Pro isn't OLED The price of the Quest Pro is proof that meta cannot sell headsets at the actual cost, $1k should be the price of the Quest 3S while the Quest Pro should be $2k or so. Meta can only sell garbage because customers are not willing to pay the actual costs due to the garbage performance and garbage graphics the headset delivers. This is why Meta loses BILLIONS per month. they just reported record profit, where do you get your information from? If you go to upload VR and see meta-reality-labs-q3-2024-revenue-rebound-continues You will find that Meta's VR division has lost about $50 billion since its 2020 creation. You do understand the difference between revenue and profit/income? You realize that all Meta's VR efforts are just to get to AR right? Ray Bans with full phone capability is the end goal, take Samsung, Apple, Google market share in hardware via AR. Yes, 100% that Meta wants to enslave its users both capturing everything you see and here and simultaneiously blocking what you see and here depending on their censorship algorithms in the real world. They will also debank you as the ultimate weapon against thought crime. I am also glad you agree that meta VR has lost $50 billion since its inception of 2020 and is continuing to lose BILLIONS per month in order to sell people garbage hardware. VR Industry would be pretty much nothing without that Meta cash infusion. Yes of course they want to make money eventually, that is their reason for existence. I too am not in favor of our tech overlords, and yet I still want it. I suppose that you eschew the use of all non ethical VR systems? The VR industry is composed mostly of garbageware games that have retarded what VR was since 2020. Meta has done nothing but drag the entire industry down. If you look at any full time VR Youtuber, they will admit like Mateo that graphics have become retarded in VR. They just accept the retardation of the industry otherwise they couldn't stay in VR and be saine. VR Content creators for the most part are chearleading garbageware to keep the views and their sanity. I would like an ethical approach to Reviewing VR content. Garbage Mobile VR should be labeled separately even if this garbage is ported to steam/psvr2. Unless the ports are outstandig like Star Wars Tailes from the Galaxy's Edge Enhaced Edition on PSVR2, all mobile garbage ware should get a tag. When people review discuss mobile ports, they should indidcate that their judgement and scale is based on mobile garbage hardware and is not a comparison against Modern Hardware (Console/PC). That would help with transparency. It would also educate people who simply believe Meta Mobile Garbage is what all VR is like. IT IS NOT. We need to break meta mobile garbage hardware's hold on the market. The only way is education because Meta is already losing billions per month trying to capture the public. You seem pretty negative, what are some things you think aren’t garbage? There are some very great experiences available for console/pc vr. "Gran Turismo 7" (Paid) & "My First Gran Turismo" (Free) are the pinnacle of VR on PS5. Of course "Horizon Call of the Mountain" is awesome. The demo is a great entryway to show people what VR is like (the boat ride scene allows people to adjust). "Until You Fall" is probably the best VR Melee combat game on the market (avaiable on all platforms). The graphics on PC/PSVR2 are good. I don't believe it is a work out game, it is simply a result of good physics. "Star Wars Tails from the Galaxy's Edge" is a really great experience that provides many different VR interactions coupled with adequate progression. I also enjoyed embodying several different unique characters from the SW universe. I also enjoyed "Arizona Sunshine 2", that was when the studio was still PC focused. Veritgo Games is now focused on Mobile Garbage hardware and it shows with how terrible metro is when compared to their fairly old Arizona Sunshine 2. For awesome graphics and a great puzzle game, Red Matter 2 is it. I don’t do consoles although I did like Gran Turismo 2 on an emulator in prep for driving my FD3S on Laguna Seca. Of course just using the headset as a display etc results in better quality graphics, Meta nor anybody else has 4090 quality on a headset. I guess you are just not a fan of any standalone VR. The best melee in Battle Talent in MR mode, it’s really good. Still haven’t found a better fighting sim than Thrill of the Fight despite the terrible graphics. Without Dynamic Foveated Rendering (DFR), the nvidia rtx 4090 is simply not good enough. The next rtx5090 won't be good enough either. Eye tracking is that important to graphics and Meta has proven they really don't care about eye tracking because their goal isn't making great gaming VR headsets. It is as you pointed out, making garbage hardware they can push onto the masses. It is really a big loss for PSVR2 on PC to not have implemented Eye Tracking. I can understand that Sony maybe didn't want to pay Tobii licensing fees on the PC for the eye tracking software – that is my suspecision of why eye tracking is not on PC for PSVR2. DFR is what allows GT7 to look so good on the PSVR2. Without eye tracking, the graphics would be much worse. Even on garbage hardware like Quest 3, eye tracking COULD allow for higher graphics rendering. But meta doesn't care about that. They care about TEXT and hand tracking. They don't care about VR gaming. I’ve never had the opportunity to try eye tracking. Hand tracking still isn’t great, it feels awkward to me. I’d rather have full body tracking. I mean, Meta put eye tracking on Quest Pro, seems maybe it cost too much to do it on the Quest 3. No. He is a known elitist troll and the opposite of Virgin. He will shit on any standalone VR because he couldn't accept that PCVR will never be main stream by itself. Aw look who's been watching Black Mirror. I really enjoyed watching Black Mirror – it is almost as if they are telling us their play book ahead of time. Michael (incel) Speth: Garbage graphics etc. Yup. Just blocked him. Not worth reading any of his content. Quest pro should never have been released, the fact that it did shows a poor working culture inside meta Still kicking myself a bought this turkey.

Title: Intel's rise and fall: A timeline of what went wrong

Getty Images Intel has been a dominant player for much of the modern computing age. Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce founded Intel in 1968. The company's name comes from the phrase "integrated electronics." In the 1980s, Intel established the x86 CPU architecture, which became the standard in consumer and many business applications for several decades. Intel's hardware portfolio spans consumer and enterprise CPUs, memory, storage and networking technologies. The company also develops software that supports its hardware and contributes to open source software development. In recent years, Intel has faced increasing competition, leading the company to fall from grace. Rival x86 chipmaker AMD has been aggressively challenging Intel's share with its performance gains. Alternative chip architectures, including Arm, have become increasingly popular leading to further erosion of Intel's dominance. GPU maker Nvidia has outpaced Intel in the AI space leading to even further losses. The market challenges have hit Intel hard. Intel's stock has been steadily declining, dropping by over 50% in 2024 alone. In November 2024, Intel was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average and replaced with Nvidia because S&P Global representatives said Nvidia was more representative of the semiconductor industry and Nvidia's share price was higher than Intel's. Then in December 2024, CEO Pat Gelsinger was forced to retire as the company's board of directors looked to reset the ailing company's direction. Intel was not an instant success. Intel's rise was achieved over decades of milestones and innovations that helped the company to succeed. 1971. Intel created its first CPU, the 4004. However, the company was initially more successful with its SRAM and DRAM memory chips. 1981. The biggest early win for Intel came in 1981 when IBM selected Intel's 8088 processor for its PCs. 1982. The 80286 -- commonly referred to as just the '286' -- processor debuted, introducing separate data buses and memory management capabilities. 1985. The 80386, or 386, debuted marking Intel's first production 32-bit architecture chip, with support of 4GB of memory. 1989. The 80486, or i486. was released further advancing Intel's CPU performance. With its integrated features and on-chip cache, it was the first x86 processor to have more than 1 million transistors. 1991. Intel launched its Intel Inside marketing campaign for PCs with its chips, and television commercials became a cultural phenomenon. The public's understanding of CPUs and what was inside a PC was lacking prior to that campaign. 1993. Intel rebranded its processors under the Pentium name. 1998. Intel debuts the Xeon process line for servers. 1999. Intel and Windows maker Microsoft -- commonly referred to as Wintel -- are added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. 2005. Apple transitions its Macintosh computers from Motorola's PowerPC to Intel's x86 processors, leading to a 15-year partnership. While Intel gained early success in the PC market, its decline was marked by the company's failure to quickly recognize growth and potential new markets. In the early 2000s, with the early era of mobile computing, Intel had a golden opportunity to get in on the ground floor. Apple asked Intel to help supply chips to power the iPhone in 2007. Then Intel CEO Paul Otellini declined the deal, on the premise that he didn't think the iPhone was going to be a high-volume business. Apple ended up going with an Arm-based chip, and today, Arm dominates the mobile space. Intel's decline is also a testament to the intense competition in the market. Rival chip makers have been actively aiming at Intel on multiple fronts. In 2017, AMD introduced its Ryzen processors, providing comparable or superior performance to the equivalent Intel chips of the day, albeit at a lower price point. Chip fabrication has also been an area of weakness for Intel as the company struggled to transition to smaller, more efficient chip designs. This allowed competitors, such as TSMC and Samsung, to effectively challenge Intel in silicon manufacturing capabilities. Intel's decline is also directly related to how it missed out on properly developing competitive GPU technology and taking part in the AI revolution. GPUs have become an essential technology in AI accelerators which are the foundation of generative AI. In the early era of GPUs during the late 1990s, Nvidia as well as ATI -- acquired by AMD in 2006 -- led the market. Intel tried unsuccessfully to build its own GPU technology including the i740 which ultimately was abandoned. Instead, Intel focused on developing integrated graphics capabilities for its processors, which never attracted much attention from gamers who rely on GPUs. In 2019, Intel acquired Habana Labs for $2 billion to enter the AI accelerator market. The Habana Guadi processors have not kept pace with Nvidia. For example, the Gaudi 3 chip announced in April 2024 did not compare favorably against the leading edge of Nvidia's portfolio. In November 2024, Intel admitted during an earnings call that the Gaudi processor was going to miss the company's revenue targets. Intel has made other mistakes and missed opportunities that have hurt the company's position. Itanium was a processor family that debuted in 2001. It developed through a partnership between Intel and Hewlett-Packard and derived from HP's PA-RISC architecture. The original goal was to create a new server architecture that would have positioned Intel for server dominance. The chips, however, did not offer proper x86 compatibility and were ultimately surpassed in the market by x86-64 architecture originally developed by AMD. Intel released the final Itanium processor in 2017. Intel's acquisition strategy also includes a series of expensive missteps. Despite paying $7.7 billion to acquire security vendor McAfee in 2010, Intel could not successfully integrate the business into Intel in a way that would have benefited the entire organization. Intel spun McAfee out into a separate company in 2016. In 2017, Intel acquired Mobileye for $15 billion and failed to fully benefit from the technology of mobile innovations into Intel's core technology platform. Mobileye was spun out as its own company in 2022. Intel's struggles extended to its product development and quality control. In 2024, Intel faced multiple class-action lawsuits over instability issues with its 13th and 14th-generation Raptor Lake processors. One of the biggest missed opportunities was in 2017 when Intel was offered and declined to invest in OpenAI. This deal would have required the AI pioneer to use Intel hardware. Though Intel faces multiple challenges it is still a strong technology vendor with options. Analysts contacted by Informa TechTarget provided their thoughts on what Intel should do to survive. The Intel 18A is an underdevelopment initiative from Intel for the next generation of semiconductor technology. The 18A refers to the size of transistors at 1.8 angstroms, or Å, and this smaller transistor size offers more computing performance packed into a chip. The Intel 18A strategy also includes the development of a new architecture known as RibbonFET, or Ribbon Field Effect Transistor, which Intel claims offers more performance per watt than prior chip architecture designs. "Intel doesn't have any quick and easy solutions," said Raj Joshi, senior vice president of Moody's Ratings. "It needs to execute its Intel 18A process node technology plan and demonstrate it can produce high volumes of wafers cost-effectively on that node. It also needs to execute its product design plans more effectively." Patrick Moorhead, CEO and chief analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, believes that Intel needs to get back to leadership with PCs, data center CPUs and data center GPUs. "Intel made strides in PC and data center CPU designs but is still losing market share," Moorhead stated. Moorhead believes Intel has the right idea with Gaudi in AI data centers, but the hyperscalers have built their own. Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and Google all have their own accelerators. Moorhead noted that for training and inference, the entire market wants high-performance, low-precision bit-rate GPUs. Beyond technology innovation, Moorhead suggests that Intel needs to be more efficient overall. "It's not just about cutting headcount. It's changing how work gets done," Moorhead said. "Intel needs to beware of cutting too much in sales and marketing or they're going to invite AMD, Qualcomm and Nvidia to take market share." Olivier Blanchard, practice lead at Futurum's Devices, said Intel's path forward shouldn't focus on correcting past mistakes. "Unfortunately, Intel can't climb into a time machine and erase any of the decisions that created the challenges it faces today," Blanchard said. For instance, he added that Intel couldn't reboot its GPU business quickly enough to compensate for a decade of misses and failures. According to Blanchard, Intel needs to create as many paths to revenue growth as possible -- including its fabrication business -- which Intel has the chance to achieve with support from the CHIPS and Science Act funding. "I also expect that Intel's importance to U.S. national security and broad economic interests will continue to give it access to a wide set of onshoring and chip fab repatriation opportunities," Blanchard said. "Execution is a whole different story, but the opportunity is there." Forrester Research analyst Alvin Nguyen says that Intel needs a new CEO to lead the company in the right direction. In Nguyen's view, Intel needs their new CEO to do the following: Sean Michael Kerner is an IT consultant, technology enthusiast and tinkerer. He has pulled Token Ring, configured NetWare and been known to compile his own Linux kernel. He consults with industry and media organizations on technology issues.

The CE 100 Index ended the last few days of 2024 and the first few days of the new year with a slight gain, adding 0.3%, while broader markets fell across the board. The Live Pillar pulled ahead by 2.3%, buoyed by iRobot, a volatile name that was up more than 24% through the week, though without any company-specific news, by Porch Group, which gained 7.5% and by Zillow, up 2.1%. The Eat segment was 2.2% higher; restaurant tech Olo advanced by 6.3% and DoorDash was 3.3% higher. Olo shares moved on the news, as reported by Yahoo Finance, that RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg increased the sell-side firm’s price target on Olo to $9 from $8, while maintaining an “outperform” rating on the name. But the Work segment countered those gains, sliding 2.2%. Xerox gave up 9.6%, giving back some of the gains that had been seen after the company struck a deal to buy Lexmark for $1.5 billion. Workday’s stock was off by 5%. In a December announcement, Workday and Guardian Life Insurance Company of America announced an expanded partnership, with the insurance firm becoming one of its strategic Workday Wellness partners. According to the announcement, Workday Wellness, an AI-powered solution, will give Guardian customers real-time insights into how their employees are using their benefits, leading to tailored benefits programs within Workday and improved overall employee experience. Guardian will introduce new application programming interface (API) connections with Workday as part of the expanded pact. Apple’s stock slipped 4.8%. As reported this past week, the tech juggernaut has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a privacy lawsuit centered on its voice assistant, Siri. The plaintiffs had argued that when Siri was activated unintentionally, the voice-activated assistant shared private discussions it overheard, and Apple allegedly shared those discussions with third parties — whereupon ads were sent to plaintiffs after mentioning various products. A preliminary settlement was filed on Dec. 31 but must be approved by a U.S. district judge. The proposed settlement requires Apple to address alleged privacy violations outlined in the lawsuit by confirming it has permanently deleted Siri audio recordings obtained before October 2019. FedEx’s shares gave up 2.2%, helping lead the Move pillar down by 0.2%. The shares lost ground as the company noted toward the end of December that its latest quarterly results saw revenues slip by 1% to $22 billion and it is streamlining operations by focusing on its DRIVE program and separating FedEx Freight into a standalone, publicly traded company. This move aims to unlock value for shareholders while allowing the two businesses to remain strategically aligned, management said during the call with analysts to discuss results. Management also noted during the call the challenges faced by FedEx during the quarter included a soft global industrial economy and competitive pricing pressures. Also within the Move segment, Tesla’s stock was 4.9% lower. Data from Tesla’s latest delivery report noted that the company had delivered a bit more than 495,900 vehicles on a global basis, up from 484,500 last year but below consensus analyst estimates on Wall Street of around 510,000 vehicles. For the year, the 1.78 million vehicles delivered marked a slight decline from 2023 levels — the first annual decline for Tesla. The company has stated in the past that growth rates might be lower than had been seen in 2023, as the firm set its sights on its next generation vehicles, as detailed by sites such as Yahoo Finance. Microsoft said that it plans to invest $80 billion to build data centers in fiscal 2025, aiming to use them to power the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI). The company is doing so amid a “golden opportunity for American AI,” Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith wrote in a blog post that debuted on Friday. More than half of this investment in AI infrastructure will be deployed in the United States, according to the post. Microsoft plans to train 2.5 million Americans with AI skills. “AI, like all new technologies, will disrupt the economy and displace some jobs,” Smith wrote. “But as we’ve working on skilling initiatives during the past few years, our confidence has grown that AI will create new opportunities that will outweigh many of the challenges ahead.” The company’s stock was down 1.7% through the week, though the overall Enablers vertical, as tracked by PYMNTS, was 0.7% higher. In other AI related-news, Meta is looking toward a future where AI characters generate content on its social media platforms Instagram and Facebook. These AI characters will exist alongside existing accounts on the platforms, Connor Hayes, vice president of product for generative AI at Meta, told the Financial Times. Meta shares gained 0.8%, which helped the overall performance of the Enablers. “They’ll have bios and profile pictures and be able to generate and share content powered by AI on the platform … that’s where we see all of this going,” Hayes said. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.
