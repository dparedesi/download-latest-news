OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has reached a valuation of $500 billion, following a deal in which current and former employees sold roughly $6.6 billion worth of shares, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters today. This represents a bump-up from its current valuation of $300 billion, underscoring OpenAI's rapid gains in both users and revenue. Reuters reported details of the stock sale earlier in August. As part of the deal, OpenAI employees sold shares to a consortium of investors including Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi's MGX and T Rowe Price, according to the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media. The company had authorised sales of $10-billion-plus worth of stock on the secondary market, the source added. Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer, MGX and T Rowe Price did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. The share sale adds to SoftBank's earlier investment in OpenAI's $40 billion primary funding round. The company generated around $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025, about 16% more than it generated all of last year, the Information reported earlier this week. The sale comes at a time when tech giants are competing aggressively for AI talent with lucrative compensation packages. Meta is notably investing billions in Scale AI and poached its 28-year-old CEO, Alexandr Wang, to lead its new super intelligence unit. Accreditation: Reuters ¬© RT√â 2025.

Title: Economy Candy: Three generations of sweets and success
URL: https://woocommerce.com/posts/economy-candy-custom-woocommerce/
Time Published: 2025-10-01T20:47:09Z
Full Content:
The WooCommerce Blog The WooCommerce Blog October 1, 2025 We recently got to visit Mitchell and Skye Cohen at Economy Candy to learn about the history of their business and how they use WooCommerce. While our team was in New York, we also filmed a short interview, which you can check out below or on our YouTube channel. Want the full story? Keep on reading for all of the sweet, sweet details of their success. üç¨üç≠ Please note that some quotes have been edited for clarity and brevity. Economy Candy began in the 1930s as a penny sweets cart outside a shoe and hat repair shop in New York City. Since then, three generations of the Cohen family have turned the business into a Lower East Side mainstay ‚Äî with the corner of Rivington and Essex named after Mitchell‚Äôs grandfather ‚Äî and national distributor of goodies from around the world. Now, Mitchell Cohen and his wife, Skye Greenfield Cohen, continue that legacy. ‚ÄúStarting before he could even see over the counter, Mitchell would work with his dad behind the register standing on a milk crate, tallying bills and calculating the change in his head,‚Äù Skye shared. Skye has also continued an important tradition: ensuring that her husband continued the family business, just as Mitchell‚Äôs mother and grandmother had done for their husbands. Their most recent evolution included an upgraded ecommerce strategy in March of 2020. When they overhauled their website, which luckily happened just in time for Covid-19 closures, they also updated their store operations. Economy Candy brought nearly 2,500 SKUs into their online store, live syncing their inventory management, and began using a combination of shipping and local pickup options to keep their business going (and their customers happy) through the pandemic and beyond. Economy Candy has weathered significant worldwide and local catastrophes in its 88-year history, and yet, they‚Äôre still going strong. Their enduring presence is due in large part to their commitment to their customers, maintaining the accessibility of their products through all of the challenging times. Over the past five years, they‚Äôve added nearly 500 new products to their inventory ‚Äî which now boasts an astounding 2,500 different sweets and goodies. Getting to 2,500 SKUs, however, required an operational pivot: all of their inventory operations used to reside exclusively in Mitchell‚Äôs brain. ‚ÄúUp until the pandemic, all of Economy Candy‚Äôs inventory was stored in Mitchell‚Äôs head,‚Äù Skye shared. ‚ÄúOur staff had to memorize the prices of all 2,000+ items we carried because we were still using dumb cash registers where the price of each item had to be manually entered. In 2021 we took a leap into the 21st century and upgraded to Square digital registers.‚Äù Their modernization coincided with the pandemic, which exasperated the need for efficient (and online-friendly) inventory management. Not allowed to bring staff in-store, Mitchell and Skye moved all sales online, managing fulfillment themselves. In 2021, they added Square digital registers and implemented barcode scanning, using Thrive to sync in-store sales with their ecommerce business. Economy Candy has been online since the dawn of the millennium. In their hunt for a solution that didn‚Äôt feel restricted in functionality or growth, they switched platforms several times until 2015 ‚Äî when they found WooCommerce. ‚ÄúWhen WooCommerce was presented to us, it was clear that limitations would no longer be an issue. Because WooCommerce is open source, there is no ceiling. There‚Äôs no limit to what you can do, what you can customize, what you can create. And it‚Äôs been great ever since.‚Äù‚Äî Skye Greenfield Cohen, Co-owner, Economy Candy Their WooCommerce store is responsible for 20 to 25% of their total sales each year, with seasonal spikes in traffic around the holidays. Thrive sits between WooCommerce and Economy Candy‚Äôs other third-party tools, and syncs sales data for in-store purchases, online transactions, and ShipStation. They‚Äôve also integrated the site with UPS, FedEx, Route, Mailchimp, Google, and Meta. With a total of 57 active plugins and custom code, Economy Candy manages a complex network of tools and services. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs incredible the way that WooCommerce is able to talk to all these different programs.‚Äù‚Äî Skye Greenfield Cohen, Co-owner, Economy Candy One aspect that Mitchell and Skye love about WooCommerce is the breadth of options for customization ‚Äî something that comes in handy when your products might melt during warmer seasons: ‚ÄúShipping chocolate in the summer is tough. It is a challenge, but one thing that Woo has been great [for], there‚Äôs a myriad of popups and messages that you can easily set up.‚Äù ‚Äú[For example,] I can set a warning,‚Äù noted Skye, ‚Äúfor anything that‚Äôs chocolate, put this text on that page so that the person ordering it knows that this is chocolate, there is a risk of melting. Do they want to add ice? Do they want to add cold packaging? So all those plugins [allow us to] set it and forget it‚Ä¶ And it has really made shipping chocolate much less of a heartbreak.‚Äù Their focus on customer satisfaction has been the key to their success: ‚ÄúEconomy Candy has survived for nearly 90 years on word of mouth,‚Äù Skye shared. ‚ÄúOf course, what ‚Äòword of mouth‚Äô means has changed a bit in the last century, from literal word of mouth to now including having our customers post about us on TikTok and Instagram and having a social media presence ourselves.‚Äù To inspire that organic promotion, they follow the rule of threes: If three people give the same feedback or request, they do their best to accommodate it. This often impacts their product and inventory decisions, from importing international sweets to making sure they stock candy from their oldest customers‚Äô youth. They take a similar approach to new product decisions, considering the selection from the customer‚Äôs point of view: Would the customer be excited to see it in store, or has someone requested something similar? Is it a unique product that they haven‚Äôt seen before? Mitchell and Skye are also mindful of future generations of their audience. Their Gen Z staff members help them stay up to date on TikTok trends and viral sweets, such as Swedish candy, freeze-dried candy, and slime lickers. As the business grows, Economy Candy continues to play to WooCommerce‚Äôs strengths. Taking advantage of all of the customization options, Mitchell and Skye know that they can change direction whenever the need arises. ‚ÄúBeing able to pivot without recreating your website from scratch every few years, which we used to do ‚Äî now we‚Äôre making tweaks on an existing platform instead of starting from scratch, and that saves a lot of money, a lot of time.‚Äù‚Äî Mitchell Cohen, Co-owner, Economy Candy ‚ÄúWith WooCommerce as the central foothold of our platform and adding pieces around that, ‚Ä¶ EconomyCandy.com is customized to what EconomyCandy.com needs to be for Economy Candy customers and for Economy Candy staff to be able to operate on the backend. We are able to put in all those custom functionalities that work for our specific business.‚Äù About Ship your WooCommerce orders with confidence, save on top carriers, and automate your processes with ShipStation.

Title: Morgan Stanley: Adobe‚Äôs Future at Risk Due to AI
URL: https://petapixel.com/2025/10/01/morgan-stanley-adobes-future-at-risk-due-to-ai/
Time Published: 2025-10-01T19:31:25Z
Full Content:
Morgan Stanley has downgraded Adobe‚Äôs stock rating, cutting its price target for the software giant amidst a perceived inability to stand out amidst the rise of generative AI. According to a report from The Street, top Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss noted a growing gap between Adobe‚Äôs AI development (and promises) and reported revenue in its Digital Media division. ‚ÄúSince that upgrade, we have seen the Digital Media annual recurring revenue (ARR) growth directionality diverge from the pace and quality of innovation being embedded within the product portfolio,‚Äù Weiss writes in his report. The full report notes that Adobe‚Äôs revenue which it can tie directly to its AI-based efforts has been lagging, and monetization is going slowly. Compounding issues are growing from competitors like Canva, Google, and Meta, who all have introduced AI-based features that they can more directly tie to revenue growth. As a result, Morgan Stanley lowered their price target for Adobe from $520 to $450. It doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs close to even hitting that lower mark, however, as the stock has been steadily falling in the past couple of weeks. It hit $353 per share on September 24 and sits at $344 on October 1. Adobe‚Äôs current weakened situation is likely a product of its own making. For the last year, Adobe has been shouting loudly about its AI development and the power of its in-house generative AI platform, Firefly. However, after updates and iterations, Firefly remains significantly behind competitors in terms of usefulness. While its select subject and remove tools have become a lot better over the last couple of months, for most of the year, its generative tools have been downright ghastly, resulting in Eldritch nightmares that don‚Äôt solve the problems they should. Its AI-based generative video tool is still far from being usable. The AI situation at Adobe has been so behind that the company recently opened up its platform to use other Generative AI tools ‚Äî most recently Nano Banana ‚Äî diminishing the value of its ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù AI to the degree that Adobe seems less concerned with it now than ever, especially as pressure mounts to make good on its AI-based revenue promises. In June, Adobe finally started tracking generative AI use through its apps via credits, which will very likely be an indicator that Adobe can use to tie AI to revenue. But if those numbers aren‚Äôt high and showing an upward trend, investors still won‚Äôt be happy. That‚Äôs tricky for the software company, as the main users of its Digital Media division are still artists, many of whom are less than happy with the proliferation of generative AI that has been trained on human work, effectively stealing knowledge so it can be sold back to them. Adobe is not wholly beloved by its customers either, who regularly clamor for someone else to step in and give Adobe competition. Its recent foray into social media network Bluesky is the best example of how Adobe‚Äôs customers feel as the company was hit with so much backlash after joining that it was effectively forced off the platform.

Title: Contrarians Only: A ‚ÄúFlash‚Äù Sale On Our Top AI Dividend
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/10/01/contrarians-only-a-flash-sale-on-our-top-ai-dividend/
Time Published: 2025-10-01T15:24:00Z
Full Content:
ByBrett Owens, Contributor. We contrarians live for the ‚Äúone-off‚Äù shots at extra income (or gains!) our favorite AI dividend plays throw our way. One of these ‚Äúspecial situations‚Äù just landed in our lap: A shot at buying a megatrend-powered 7.6% dividend that‚Äôs rarely cheap. And we‚Äôre picking it up for a song. It‚Äôs a long-time holding of our Contrarian Income Report advisory, and it‚Äôs sitting right in the tracks of the surging AI buildout. In fact, it may be the last ‚Äúcheap‚Äù AI play on the board! This one‚Äôs dropped from trading for more than its portfolio is worth to a lot less. As you can see, this fund dropped from trading 6% above its net asset value (NAV, or the per-share value of its portfolio) to 7.1% below, as of this writing. It‚Äôs a huge drop, and it stands out because, as you can see above, this fund, the 7.6%-yielding Cohen & Steers Infrastructure Fund (UTF), is rarely cheap for long. UTF‚Äôs latest tour in our Contrarian Income Report portfolio started in November 2020, and this reliable utility fund has been humming away since, handing us a 7.8% yield on our original buy, plus a monthly payout that‚Äôs rolled in like clockwork. That‚Äôs exactly what we bought it to do. And it‚Äôs handed us a 41% total return in that time, too. And now we have a shot at buying it cheaper than we did five years ago! Let me put all of this in dollars and cents for you. In the past year, UTF‚Äôs average premium has been 1.8%. If the discount reverts to that level, price upside of around 10% is on the table here. And that‚Äôs before we factor in the growth of its portfolio. Let‚Äôs talk about that now. We bought UTF in late 2020 because its utility-stock holdings‚Äîincluding big players like NextEra Energy (NEE), Duke Energy (DUK) and Southern Co. (CO)‚Äîare essentially ‚Äúbond proxies.‚Äù When rates fall, as they did then, utilities rise. Nowadays, we have a similar setup. As we discussed in last week‚Äôs article on some of our favorite gold dividends, long rates are essentially capped, and short-term rates (controlled by the Fed) are falling. Plus we have another, far bigger driver: AI‚Äôs limitless power demand. Let‚Äôs take Texas, ground zero for the AI power boom. Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) have built data centers there. According to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), Texas alone expects a 62% surge in power demand by 2030 as these data centers multiply. That‚Äôs just one state, utilities nationwide are racing to add capacity. To be sure, this AI-utility trade is far from a secret, so why the discount on UTF? Look at the chart below. In orange, we have UTF‚Äôs total NAV return (again, the value of its underlying portfolio) for 2025. In purple we see its total return based on market price (or what investors are paying for the fund itself on the open market). As you can see, the total NAV return has continued its climb. The market-price return, meantime, has dropped, carving out that 7.1% ‚Äúdiscount gap.‚Äù This is the kind of sign we contrarians love because it shows that this discount is not because management blew a stock selection (or many). It‚Äôs all about investor sentiment. And we‚Äôre happy to take the other side of the bet when investors turn bearish on a solid fund like this one. Why the sour mood? UTF‚Äôs management firm, Cohen & Steers, is doing something CEF managers rarely do: conducting a ‚Äútransferable rights offering‚Äù on the fund. Under this setup, if you held shares of UTF as of the ‚Äúrecord date‚Äù‚ÄîSeptember 22‚Äîyou get one ‚Äúright‚Äù to buy new shares at a discount: Every five rights lets you buy one new UTF share. Here‚Äôs how that will work: When the offer expires on October 16, the price of the new shares will be set at 95% of the stock‚Äôs average closing price on that date and the four trading days leading up to it. If the fund‚Äôs average price is below 90% of its NAV‚Äîagain, the per-share value of its underlying portfolio‚Äîthe price will be set at 90% of NAV. That ‚Äúfloor‚Äù helps limit the offer‚Äôs downside pressure on the shares. If you owned UTF as of September 22, you‚Äôll be able to exercise your rights and even more, if there are leftover shares other investors don‚Äôt pick up. If you don‚Äôt want to get in on the action here, that‚Äôs fine‚Äîyou can sell your rights‚Äîhence the ‚Äútransferable‚Äù in the name. All of the details of the rights offering are on C&S‚Äôs website. All of this, in a nutshell, is why UTF has dropped to a discount.. But how do I know this is a buying opportunity? Let‚Äôs look at history. I did say earlier that rights offerings were rare for CEFs, but on March 19, Nuveen announced a similar deal on its Nuveen Credit Strategies Income Fund (JQC). JQS‚Äôs discount deepened on the offer‚Äôs announcement, then ground back toward its norm when the expiry date rolled around. I expect the same with UTF‚Äôs AI tailwind, capped interest rates and management‚Äôs ability to sniff out winning infrastructure plays. And thanks to the rights offering, they‚Äôll have even more cash to work with. If you own UTF, this is your chance to buy more at a bargain. If not, you still get to buy a rarely cheap fund for 93 cents on the dollar‚Äîand ride its closing ‚Äúdiscount gap‚Äù higher. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: CoreWeave Stock To $250?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/01/coreweave-stock-to-250/
Time Published: 2025-10-01T13:22:50Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CoreWeave stock (NASDAQ:CRWV) exhibited an impressive performance increase of 12% on September 30, 2025, following the announcement of a groundbreaking $14.2 billion partnership with Meta Platforms, affirming the organization‚Äôs position as a leading AI infrastructure provider. The seven-year agreement with Meta, which extends through December 2031 with the potential for expansion into 2032, signifies a strategic diversification success for CoreWeave. Having been reliant on Microsoft for roughly 70% of its revenue, this partnership fundamentally alters CoreWeave‚Äôs risk related to client concentration while illustrating the scalability of its specialized GPU infrastructure model. The partnership guarantees Meta access to CoreWeave‚Äôs Nvidia GB300 server racks, each outfitted with 72 of Nvidia‚Äôs advanced Blackwell AI GPUs, establishing CoreWeave as Meta‚Äôs infrastructure partner for forthcoming AI workloads. This agreement comes on the heels of CoreWeave‚Äôs recent $6.5 billion expansion with OpenAI, raising the total contracted revenue with OpenAI to $22.4 billion and creating a varied blue-chip client portfolio. We elaborate further on this development and CoreWeave‚Äôs valuation in the sections below. That being said, if you‚Äôre looking for a less volatile investment than holding a single stock like CRWV, you might consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark‚Äîa combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes‚Äîand has realized returns surpassing 91% since its inception. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; avoiding a tumultuous experience, as demonstrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics. In addition, refer to ‚Äì Wait For A Dip To Buy Hims & Hers Health Stock Meta‚Äôs dedication grants CoreWeave unparalleled revenue visibility and confirms the company‚Äôs specialized ‚ÄúAI Hyperscaler‚Äù strategy. As Meta actively enhances its investments in AI infrastructure‚Äîwith capital expenditures anticipated between $66-72 billion for 2025‚ÄîCoreWeave becomes an essential infrastructure provider for one of the largest AI spenders in the tech industry. The agreement bolsters CoreWeave‚Äôs competitive advantage against hyperscale cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud by showcasing that specialized AI infrastructure can command premium pricing and foster client loyalty. CoreWeave‚Äôs current market capitalization of approximately $70 billion and its current revenue base of $3.5 billion indicate that the company trades at roughly 19 times trailing revenue‚Äîa compelling multiple considering its rapid growth trajectory. For context, CoreWeave's revenue is projected to increase over 3.5 times, nearing approximately $18 billion by 2027. Does this imply the company‚Äôs valuation will decrease to under 4 times sales, assuming the stock price stays stable? We do not think so. Even at a more conservative 8 times revenues, the company‚Äôs valuation would likely surpass $145 billion, representing more than a doubling from current levels in the next three years. Indeed, this valuation seems conservative when compared to other high-growth technology stocks that trade at considerably higher revenue multiples. For instance, among AI and Data Infrastructure Leaders, Snowflake trades at around 18x revenue despite slower 28% growth rates, while Palantir commands a 124x revenue multiple with a 39% growth rate. In the realm of High-Growth SaaS Companies, Palo Alto Networks trades at a 15x revenue multiple, and HubSpot at a 10x multiple. There are numerous other comparable examples. CoreWeave‚Äôs recent achievements authenticate our previous forecasts of substantial upside potential, with the stock rising 47% over the last month and more than tripling since its IPO in March 2025 at $40 per share. The company‚Äôs revenue growth of 206% year-over-year in Q2 2025, reaching $1.213 billion with 62% adjusted EBITDA margins, showcases significant operational leverage at scale. With a contracted backlog of $30.1 billion offering multi-year revenue predictability and nearly 50% anticipated to be realized within 24 months, CoreWeave presents investors with both growth and certainty‚Äîan unusual pairing in high-growth technology stocks. The partnership with Meta reinforces CoreWeave‚Äôs thesis as the specialized infrastructure layer driving the AI revolution, positioning the company for sustained growth as enterprise AI adoption accelerates across various verticals. Naturally, we could be incorrect in our evaluations, and investors should carefully consider the risks prior to investing in CRWV stock. The primary risks associated with CoreWeave revolve around its financial stability and market standing. Specifically, the company confronts substantial challenges stemming from fierce competition with major cloud providers and the possibility of market cyclicality in AI spending. From an operational perspective, CoreWeave has a -29% net margin and a $15 billion debt burden necessary for significant infrastructure investments, compounded by a critical customer concentration risk with major clients such as OpenAI. It‚Äôs important to recognize that investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be perilous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to generate strong returns for investors. What accounts for this success? The quarterly rebalanced combination of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has offered a dynamic means to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses when the markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Pseudonymous X user Buzzlamic Jihad, who is called Buzz by his friends and family, told Decrypt that he hopes to address Aptos‚Äô image problem and position it as a premium stablecoin network‚Äîharking back to the original Libra vision from Facebook in which Aptos was founded. He said that one way he aims to do this is by leveraging his personal connections with the co-founders of the President Trump-backed World Liberty Financial, two of whom were mentors to the shitposter. "Buzz is an inventor and true Aptos missionary through and through,‚Äù Ash Pampati, head of ecosystem at Aptos, told Decrypt. ‚ÄúI'm excited for him to come on board as an advisor to expand everyone's imagination of what is truly possible only on Aptos.‚Äù Aptos looking good here https://t.co/eTQrNlu1ga ‚Äî üêù (üåê/acc) (@BuzzlamicJihad) September 14, 2025 Back in February, Buzz was partly responsible for a 17% pump for Aptos' APT token as the crypto community started to notice the memes he had been posting for months. The then-little-known social media user had been spamming ‚ÄúAptos lookin‚Äô good here,‚Äù ‚Äúsidelined?‚Äù and ‚Äúmotion not priced in yet‚Äù in unwavering support for the layer-1 blockchain. These phrases have since become canonical crypto memes, with major crypto figures and companies embracing them. The buzz, pardon the pun, was so effective that Pampati told Decrypt in May it helped to revive developer interest in the network, in an unexpected display of the power of memes. Aptos looking good here This is just the last 24h pic.twitter.com/pagwYwZ1nD ‚Äî üêù (üåê/acc) (@BuzzlamicJihad) February 16, 2025 At the time, people wondered how a seemingly random X user could have such a large impact. It turns out Buzz has a history in growth marketing, specializing in Facebook advertising, and claims to have generated millions with this venture. During that period, Buzz told Decrypt, he was mentored by Chase Herro and Zak Folkman, successful Facebook marketers who went on to co-found World Liberty Financial. At one point, Buzz said he lived with the pair in Puerto Rico and was briefly their business partner. Given his history with Facebook, now Meta, Buzz explained that he was immediately attracted to Aptos as it was formed by developers from Libra‚Äîa now-defunct stablecoin project led by Facebook. The deeper he dug, the more he liked about Aptos, and he started posting about it under the pseudonym Buzzlamic Jihad. After the February pump, Buzz claims he was offered a role in marketing at Aptos but turned it down. Over the coming months, he continued conversations with the Aptos team and has now signed a deal to become an advisor. In many ways, Buzz joining Aptos as an advisor is comparable to if meme stock influencer Keith ‚ÄúRoaring Kitty‚Äù Gill joined GameStop‚Äîa rumor that once circulated on the internet. As the possibility of joining Aptos emerged, Buzz reached out to Folkman after years of not being in contact and told him, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs run it back.‚Äù He helped connect Folkman with Aptos CEO Avery Ching, with the pair meeting at the White House crypto summit in March. Following this interaction, and without further help from Buzz, World Liberty Financial agreed to list its USD1 stablecoin on Aptos‚Äîwhich was announced in October at Token2049 in Singapore. BREAKING: @DonaldJTrumpJr & @ZachWitkoff just announced that @worldlibertyfi's USD1 is coming to @Aptos as the first Move based deployment. Our teams share a united mission of building the best financial infrastructure for üá∫üá∏ and the world. Much more to come‚Ä¶ ü¶Öüåê https://t.co/DjxBvviJts pic.twitter.com/0P3YfSaY63 ‚Äî avery.apt üá∫üá∏ (@AveryChing) October 1, 2025 But this is just the beginning, Buzz told Decrypt. He intends to continue to leverage his relationship with the World Liberty Financial team to attract ‚Äúnet new buyers‚Äù to Aptos, fix its image, and position it as a premium stablecoin network. He went on to hint at bigger potential collaborations to come, although nothing is set in stone. ‚ÄúI think it's very relevant right now because you see chains like Plasma, they‚Äôre doing very well. Everyone was talking about them. Now you even have Circle, they‚Äôre launching the Tempo blockchain,‚Äù Buzz said, referencing the Plasma stablecoin network. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre basically doing Libra 2.0 ‚Ä¶ so the idea is validated. Aptos has the technology, it‚Äôs just frustrating that they don‚Äôt have the right messaging.‚Äù Now officially working for Aptos, Buzz hopes to have a direct hand in fixing this messaging. He also told Decrypt that he has some ‚Äúbigger goals‚Äù which, if he achieves, he will be paid more for. That‚Äôs not to mention that he‚Äôs requested that he be paid entirely in APT tokens, as a sign of his belief in the network. After making his name by asking people if they‚Äôre sidelined, Buzz is finally no longer sidelined himself. ‚ÄúI am trying to community takeover,‚Äù Buzz told Decrypt. ‚ÄúThat started as a meme, but as it progressed, I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòMaybe it's actually possible. Could I actually do this?‚Äô,‚Äù he said, adding, ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a joke anymore. I‚Äôm actually working on it.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs lookin' good here,‚Äù he finished.

Title: 9 Best Social Media Management Tools for Agencies

Time Published: 2025-10-01T05:06:30Z

Manage all your social accounts in one place Find high-quality content and viral post ideas Design images with stock media editing tools Classify your posts into topic-based buckets Compose, customize and preview your posts Automate your social publishing schedule Evaluate post performance and engagement Create and manage posts on your phone Struggling to figure out which social media management tools for agencies are actually worth it? Most tools look great on the surface ‚Äî until you try to onboard five clients, publish across 10 platforms, and collaborate with your team‚Ä¶ all while staying under budget. That‚Äôs when the cracks show. You hit limits on users. Scheduling posts takes forever. You still have to chase down content ideas. And don‚Äôt even get us started on clunky approval workflows or missing analytics. What agencies really need is a tool that‚Äôs: After testing dozens of social media management tools for agencies, I narrowed it down to these top 9 ‚Äî each ranked by what they do best. Managing multiple clients or brands? You can‚Äôt afford to waste hours every week bouncing between content folders, caption drafts, and platforms. That‚Äôs where Post Planner shines. It‚Äôs a social media management tool built to help agencies find, create, schedule, and recycle high-performing content across every major social network ‚Äî without the price tag or complexity of other platforms. You can schedule content across: And the best part? It‚Äôs one of the most affordable tools on this list (even when you need more users and social accounts). Here's a demo video that shows just how simple it is to use: Post Planner offers 4 main pricing plans: Visit our pricing page for more details on each plan. Post Planner mainly receives 4-5 stars across online review platforms. Customers love the time they save scheduling their posts with Post Planner's easy-to-navigate UI. More critical reviews mention that they wish more advanced reporting features were available. Here's what Aubrey C. has to say about using Post Planner: ‚ÄúThis program is an absolute LIFE SAVER. As a person who runs multiple clients, I needed something that saved me time because I work a full-time day job in addition to my freelance services. I was looking for something affordable, user-friendly, and quick to learn on my own. I got all of those things but learning on my own wasn't necessary. The team is extremely responsive via text chat and they have plenty of training. Aside from that, this program helped me optimize my work and the post batching is potentially my favorite part. I love that there's an app for me to use in addition to my desktop. It makes it very easy for me to use no matter where I'm at. On a personal note, the customer service was better than most places these days. They were responsive, supportive, and encouraging, not to mention extremely helpful and kind. A business like theirs will always get my advocacy and money going forward. Many thanks for everything, Post Planner!‚Äù If your agency manages lots of clients or publishes across a high volume of social media profiles, SocialPilot is built for you. It‚Äôs a robust, client-ready platform with built-in team collaboration, white-label dashboards, bulk scheduling, and approval workflows. Even better? You get a lot of those premium features for less than you‚Äôd pay for other enterprise-level competitors. While it doesn‚Äôt include content discovery like Post Planner, it‚Äôs a great fit for agencies that already have their content strategy dialed in ‚Äî and need a clean system to manage the execution. SocialPilot offers 4 main pricing plans: SocialPilot mostly receives 4-5 stars across online reviews. Customers love the value you get for the price, especially if they manage a lot of accounts. Finding many complaints was a struggle, although some mentioned occasional scheduling errors. Here's what Nyika S. has to say about using SocialPilot: ‚ÄúI'm happy with it. The pricing is better than Hootsuite which is what I used before; and it's almost as easy to use. I liked how easy it was to 1. add my team members 2. on-board them (platform is easy to learn) and 3. post and schedule content. I can also easily repost content previously scheduled. Pricing packages are slightly rigid- I am in between packages but I have to go with the more expensive one so I don't miss out on features. There is an inability to add a channel the same way you add a team member. I am optimistic this will be added soon.‚Äù Sprout Social is the Swiss Army knife of social media management ‚Äî especially for agencies that need serious reporting, cross-platform coordination, and team workflows. It‚Äôs loaded with features: smart inboxes, sentiment analysis, employee advocacy, influencer tracking, publishing tools, and fully customizable analytics dashboards. But all that power comes at a cost. Sprout Social is one of the most expensive tools on this list ‚Äî which makes it better suited for larger agencies or high-ticket clients where granular insights and premium reporting are non-negotiable. Sprout Social has 4 main pricing plans: Since Sprout Social was one of the first social media management tools, it has collected thousands of online reviews, mostly between 4-5 stars. Customers love that it's loaded with plenty of advanced features like the Smart Inbox and reports. The high cost is one of the few dislikes some customers mention. Here's what one verified user has to say about using Sprout Social: "As a smaller company with a solo social marketer, Sprout enables us to scale our social presence with purpose and ease. The unified inbox is a game-changer - I'm able to see all mentions, comments, and messages across all of our platforms and it saves hours. Implementation was easy, reporting is professional grade and the interface is intuitive. The biggest drawback of Sprout Social is the price. The base cost is already on the higher end, and then crucial features like social listening are locked behind an even more expensive add-on. This is frustrating, because listening is essential for proactive strategy, but it feels like it‚Äôs priced for enterprise budgets only. For a tool that does so much right, it‚Äôs disappointing that such a core feature isn‚Äôt included or available at a more accessible tier. So we have to maintain a separate, more affordable tool to fill that gap." If your agency juggles multiple clients and approval rounds, Planable was made for you. It turns messy email threads and spreadsheet calendars into one simple, visual platform ‚Äî where your team and clients can draft, comment, approve, and publish content without the back-and-forth. It‚Äôs especially useful for agencies that prioritize client collaboration and fast review cycles. Just note: while Planable excels at internal workflows, it doesn‚Äôt offer content discovery or curation tools. So it‚Äôs better suited for agencies that already have content ready to go. Planable offers 4 main pricing plans: Paid plans come with unlimited users. Planable mostly receives 4-5 stars across customer reviews online. Users commonly praise its collaboration abilities and its simplicity. Meanwhile, one common thing reviewers criticize is its lack of reporting abilities. Here's what Andrea has to say about using Planable: "Planable has truly changed how we manage our content and social media strategy execution. For me, it‚Äôs an all-in-one social media management platform that makes planning and scheduling both visual and intuitive. I can see our content calendar, drag and drop posts, and collaborate in real time. I would say that the value of Planable is its efficiency and ease of use. Everything happens in one place. It helps our small team work like a big one: structured, aligned, and fast. I can‚Äôt recommend it enough." Hootsuite has long been a go-to platform for agencies managing complex client needs ‚Äî especially when it comes to customer interaction, social listening, and paid campaign management. What makes it especially strong for agencies is the ability to engage directly with followers across platforms using a centralized inbox, plus advanced features for ad management, sentiment analysis, and employee advocacy. That said, the price tag is steep ‚Äî and some users report customer service hiccups. If your agency doesn‚Äôt need deep listening or paid social workflows, more affordable tools will give you better ROI. Hootsuite has 3 main pricing plans available: Most Hootsuite customers rate it 4 or 5 stars across review sites. Customers value its social media management and team collaboration features. One of the most common complaints is its higher pricing. Here's what Taylor has to say about using Hootsuite: "I am excited about using Hootsuite because of the social media benchmarking and social listening. One thing that I've noticed since using the product is that customer service doesn't respond to chats, the social media platform analytics are not accurate (I have to go to Meta or Linkedin directly for accurate numbers on impressions and likes), and Hootsuite doesn't seem to see when I check the inbox (I got a message recently saying that if I didn't use the inbox within 5 days, the function would be taken away. I use this function every single work day so this is confusing)." If you‚Äôre drowning in DMs, mentions, and client check-ins, Agorapulse might be the sanity-saver your agency needs. Its biggest strength? A unified inbox that lets your team stay on top of comments, messages, reviews, and brand mentions ‚Äî all from one clean dashboard. Add advanced team roles, saved replies, and reporting that ties posts to ROI, and it‚Äôs easy to see why many agencies trust it as their main social media management tool. Just know: it‚Äôs not cheap, and you‚Äôll need to move to higher-tier plans to unlock features like bulk scheduling. Agorapulse has 4 main pricing plans and a 30-day free trial: Most customers rate Agorapulse 4-5 stars across online reviews. Customers like being able to manage all of their social media DMs in one place and the ability to track brand mentions across social platforms. One of the most common criticisms is the high price point for smaller businesses. Here's what Bianka B. has to say about using Agorapulse: ‚ÄúAgorapulse is an essential tool for social media management. We use it daily at Effet B and particularly appreciate its intuitive interface, comprehensive features (scheduling, moderation, reporting), and the clarity of the reports. The calendar is very well designed, the unified inbox tool saves us valuable time, and the customer service is always quick and efficient. It is a reliable platform that allows us to better collaborate as a team and optimize our social strategies. I highly recommend Agorapulse to any agency or SME looking to structure and simplify their social media management.‚Äù If your agency is focused on Instagram growth ‚Äî especially for visual brands like ecom, beauty, or lifestyle ‚Äî Later is one of the most polished tools out there. From grid planning and hashtag suggestions to visual drag-and-drop scheduling and link-in-bio tools, it‚Äôs built specifically for teams that live and breathe IG content. And while it supports other platforms too (like TikTok, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Pinterest), many of its best features are Instagram-only. It‚Äôs not the most budget-friendly option, and it lacks advanced reporting and content discovery tools ‚Äî but for agencies that want to nail the look and flow of their clients‚Äô feeds, it‚Äôs hard to beat. Later offers 3 pricing plans: Later mostly receives 4-5 stars across online reviews. Users love saving hours by scheduling posts months in advance. Some users mention the price being higher than they'd like and the UI feeling a bit clunky. Here's what Fiona M. has to say about using Later: ‚ÄúOverall experience is 99/100 for Later. I‚Äôve tried other scheduling programs but this is by far the best. Later is so easy to use and the visual grid is excellent - it‚Äôs also super easy to manage multiple profiles and multiple client social accounts. There are so many features from drafts to analytics to the linkin bio It‚Äôs missing LinkedIn analytics which would make it perfect and I‚Äôd love to be able to auto post stories on Instagram but otherwise all good.‚Äù Buffer is a clean, intuitive social media management tool that agencies love for one big reason: it just works. If your team values clarity, ease of use, and strong analytics, Buffer delivers. It‚Äôs especially great for agencies focused on consistent publishing and reporting ‚Äî without the distractions of features you‚Äôll never use. You won‚Äôt find content discovery or fancy visual planners here. But if you‚Äôre managing clients who value strategy, data, and smooth workflows, Buffer is a dependable, low-friction option. Unlike some of the other schedulers on this list, Buffer charges you per channel that you use. Buffer offers 3 main pricing plans: Most Buffer customers rate the software between 4-5 stars across thousands of online reviews. Most users value its scheduling, social media management, and analytics features. On the other hand, users sometimes comment that the UI is a bit funky and dislike the pricing structure being based on channels. Here's what Void D. has to say about using Buffer: "Overall my experience with buffer was really great. I ended up moving to another post scheduler due to the necessity of multiple post queues, but really miss the overall ease of use with buffer. Buffer has a very easy to use interface, and auto-scheduling and reorganizing scheduled posts is extremely easy. The workflow feels intuitive and I never had to pull out the FAQ to figure out how to do what I wanted. The lack of ability to have multiple post scheduling queues for a single social media account. One queue works fine if you only post a single type of content, but having to manually schedule or re-organize the schedule if you have multiple post types (images, video, text, etc) gets really tedious." Onlypult is one of the most underrated social media tools for agencies ‚Äî especially if you need broad platform support without a bloated price tag. It‚Äôs designed primarily for Facebook and Instagram, but it actually supports over a dozen networks (including Telegram, Tumblr, VK, and even Medium). If your clients use a wide range of channels ‚Äî or if you're managing international brands ‚Äî Onlypult can help you cover them all. While it lacks modern content discovery and curation tools, it does offer unique extras like a built-in website builder and brand mention tracking. And with scalable pricing for teams, it‚Äôs a decent option for lean agencies. Onlypult offers 4 main pricing plans: Onlypult has the fewest online reviews of any schedulers on this list, but of the reviews it has, it mostly gets 4-5 stars. Customers value Onlypult's Instagam-first approach. However, some critics complain that the platform is not as robust as other platforms. Here's what one verified user has to say about using Onlypult: "Using Onlypult, I have managed Social channels easily. For me, it is key the Ig preview and the AI help for the captions I do not like the fact that the pages/profiles of the same client are not really synchronised, so you have to deal them one by one. Also the calendar view is by social media channel, I would prefer a complete view by date. It is a platform for planning, so you can prepare/plan posts in advance." The right social media management tool can save you hours, help you scale clients, and actually make posting fun again. Most of the tools on this list offer a free trial ‚Äî but if you want a budget-friendly option built specifically for agencies, Post Planner is a great place to start. It‚Äôs affordable, easy to use, and packed with time-saving features like content buckets, AI writing tools, and bulk scheduling. Sign up for a free Post Planner account and see how much smoother your agency‚Äôs social media can run. No Comments ¬© 2011-2025 Post Planner

Title: Big Tech's AI Spending‚Äîand Borrowing‚ÄîWill Be Even Higher Next Year, Says Citi
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/big-tech-s-ai-spending-and-borrowing-will-be-even-higher-next-year-says-citi-11821812
Time Published: 2025-09-30T22:39:30Z
Full Content:
After a series of big cloud computing deals this month, Citigroup analysts now expect AI spending to exceed their already eye-watering forecast. Citi analysts on Tuesday estimated that hyperscalers‚Äîincluding Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Oracle (ORCL), and CoreWeave (CRWV)‚Äîwill spend $490 billion on infrastructure and other capital goods next year, up from a prior estimate of $420 billion. Citi‚Äôs forecasts are slightly above the Wall Street consensus. The AI infrastructure boom has been a major force behind U.S. stock market gains and economic growth in recent years. If tech companies rely on debt to fund their massive AI investments, they could expose the AI buildout‚Äîand the broader economy‚Äîto greater risk. The analysts pointed to an onslaught of announced partnerships, investments, and products in recent weeks as evidence of strong AI demand. They said their recent conversations with CIOs and CTOs at a range of companies ‚Äúreflect a similar increase in urgency around adoption at the enterprise level.‚Äù Citi expects AI infrastructure providers like Nvidia (NVDA) to benefit from higher spending. As such, the firm‚Äôs analysts raised their price target on Nvidia shares to $210 from $200 on Tuesday. The hyperscalers are among the world‚Äôs largest, most profitable companies, a fact that has enabled them to increase their infrastructure spending exponentially over the past few years. But not even hugely profitable tech giants can undertake this level of investment on their own. ‚ÄúIt is notable that we have gone from the cash flow funded stage of this investment cycle to the debt funded stage, with the incremental risks that come with it,‚Äù Citi‚Äôs analysts wrote. Oracle last week sold $18 billion of bonds in the second-largest U.S. debt deal this year, according to a Bloomberg report. Oracle, which has spent more than it's made in each of the last two quarters, is expected to use the debt to increase its cloud capacity so it can deliver on a five-year, $300 billion deal with OpenAI. Adding that much capacity will be expensive. Citi sees Oracle‚Äôs capital expenditures ballooning to $58 billion in fiscal year 2027, nearly three times what it spent in the fiscal year that ended in May. OpenAI, another company that will need to spend a lot to support its ambitions, took a different approach to raising money. Last week, the company struck a deal with Nvidia to deploy 10 GW of Nvidia systems over the next five years in exchange for an incremental $100 billion equity investment. OpenAI is reportedly discussing leasing‚Äînot buying‚Äîthe chips from Nvidia, a novel arrangement that could cut its hardware costs by 10 to 15%, according to The Information. The deal raised eyebrows on Wall Street, where some analysts and investors expressed concern about the ‚Äúcircularity‚Äù and concentration of the AI ecosystem. Some skeptics likened it to a bailout, with Nvidia stepping in as an investor of last resort to support a cash-starved OpenAI. It has also inspired comparisons to the Dotcom Bubble, when telecom equipment providers lent to and invested in their own customers, fueling speculative fervor. But analysts see important differences between the 1990s and today. ‚ÄúThe critical distinction, in our view, is the ‚Äòoff-ramp‚Äô created by growing external demand for AI services driven by enterprise adoption,‚Äù write Citi analysts. Companies like OpenAI and Meta (META), they say, are rolling out AI-driven applications and services with clear monetization prospects. And the rate of AI‚Äôs technological progress, they argue, is quickly expanding the scope of potential applications.

U.S. stocks coasted to the finish of their latest winning month. The S&P 500 rose 0.4% Tuesday to close out its fifth straight winning month after setting a record last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.3%. The quiet trading came as a potential shutdown of the U.S. government loomed. Past shutdowns have had limited impact on the economy and stock market, and many investors expect something similar this time around. Treasury yields wavered but ultimately held relatively steady following mixed reports on the U.S. economy. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP‚Äôs earlier story follows below. U.S. stocks are coasting toward the finish of Wall Street‚Äôs latest winning month on Tuesday, as financial markets give a collective yawn for the potential shutdown of the U.S. federal government that‚Äôs looming. The S&P 500 edged up by 0.1% and is on track for a fifth straight winning month after setting a record last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 18 points, or less than 0.1%, with an hour remaining in trading, and the Nasdaq composite was virtually unchanged. The quiet trading came as a midnight deadline approached, when the U.S. government looks likely to shut down because of Washington‚Äôs latest political impasse. That‚Äôs because history has shown that past shutdowns have had limited impact on the economy and stock market, and many economists and professional investors expect something similar this time around. The S&P 500 has climbed an average of 4.4% during past shutdowns and is positive over the last five, according to Monica Guerra, head of U.S. policy at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. The broad stock market has been on a nearly relentless run since hitting a low in April on expectations that President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs won‚Äôt derail global trade and that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates several times to boost the slowing job market. Treasury yields wavered in the bond market but ultimately held relatively steady following a couple mixed reports on the U.S. economy. One said consumers are feeling less confident than economists expected, with many respondents in the Conference Board‚Äôs survey pointing to the job market and to inflation that has remained higher than anyone would like. A second report suggested the job market may be remaining in its ‚Äúlow-hire, low-fire‚Äù state. U.S. employers were advertising roughly the same number of job openings at the end of August as the month before. The hope on Wall Street had been for a number that‚Äôs neither too high nor too low, one balanced enough to keep the Fed on track to continue cutting interest rates. The Fed just delivered its first cut of the year, and officials have penciled in more through the end of next year to give the job market a boost. Too-strong data on jobs could make the Fed less willing to cut rates, which would back up criticism that the U.S. stock market has become too expensive after prices ran so high. Too-weak numbers, meanwhile, could signal a coming recession, which would also hurt stock prices. When Wall Street will get upcoming data reports on the job market and inflation is uncertain, though. A shutdown of the federal government would cause delays for several important reports, including Friday‚Äôs on how many jobs U.S. employers created and destroyed in September. That could make Wall Street more twitchy when investors are already nervous about the state of the economy and what that means for the potential for cuts to rates. The Department of Labor has already said that the Bureau of Labor Statistics will completely cease operations if there‚Äôs a lapse. On Wall Street, Spotify Technology sank 5.4% after the Stockholm-based streaming giant said its founder, Daniel Ek, is stepping down as CEO to become the executive chairman. Two of his lieutenants will replace him as co-CEOs: Chief Product and Technology Officer Gustav S√∂derstr√∂m and Chief Business Officer Alex Norstr√∂m. Oil-related companies weighed on the market after the price of crude fell again as traders see too much oil washing around the world. Schlumberger fell 2.7%, and Halliburton dropped 2%. On the winning side of Wall Street was CoreWeave, which jumped 11.8%. It said Meta Platforms will pay up to $14.2 billion for a new order for cloud computing power made under its existing service agreement, with the potential for more. Lamb Weston climbed 4% after the supplier of frozen French fries and other potato products reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. In stock markets abroad, indexes ticked higher in Europe following a mixed finish in Asia. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury held steady at 4.15%, where it was late Monday. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed. ¬© 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

OccamsWhiskers: Seeing the comments that TFA is about Cramer, I'm even more committed to not RTFA. But I worked for a company that had survived the dotcom bubble, though in one office you could "feel the psychic damage" of the 90% paper loss years later (as my branch's founder put it).I wondered what the secret had been and a customer put it very simply. 3 things: the company had real products, real customers, and real profits.So if AI in general goes bust, I think the companies that built trillion-dollar empires on other tech will survive, albeit with a lot of pain. It's the pure AI companies that will disappear if investors lose faith before those 3 ingredients are present. If you like these links, you'll love Come for the Total, stay for the Farking.

By STAN CHOE, AP Business Writer NEW YORK (AP) ‚Äî U.S. stocks coasted to the finish of their latest winning month on Tuesday, as Wall Street yawned at the potential shutdown of the U.S. federal government that‚Äôs looming. The S&P 500 rose 0.4% to close out its fifth straight winning month after setting a record last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 81 points, or 0.2%, to set its own all-time high, and the Nasdaq composite ticked 0.3% higher.

The S&P 500 has climbed an average of 4.4% during past shutdowns and is positive over the last five, according to Monica Guerra, head of U.S. policy at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. What could make this shutdown different, though, is that the White House may push for large-scale firings of federal workers. The broad stock market has been on a nearly relentless run since hitting a low in April on expectations that President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs won‚Äôt derail global trade and that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates several times to boost the slowing job market.

Chinese AI lab DeepSeek broke into the mainstream consciousness this week after its chatbot app rose to the top of the Apple App Store charts (and Google Play, as well). DeepSeek‚Äôs AI models, which were trained using compute-efficient techniques, have led Wall Street analysts ‚Äî and technologists ‚Äî to question whether the U.S. can maintain its lead in the AI race and whether the demand for AI chips will sustain. But where did DeepSeek come from, and how did it rise to international fame so quickly? DeepSeek is backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund that uses AI to inform its trading decisions. AI enthusiast Liang Wenfeng co-founded High-Flyer in 2015. Wenfeng, who reportedly began dabbling in trading while a student at Zhejiang University, launched High-Flyer Capital Management as a hedge fund in 2019 focused on developing and deploying AI algorithms. In 2023, High-Flyer started DeepSeek as a lab dedicated to researching AI tools separate from its financial business. With High-Flyer as one of its investors, the lab spun off into its own company, also called DeepSeek. From day one, DeepSeek built its own data center clusters for model training. But like other AI companies in China, DeepSeek has been affected by U.S. export bans on hardware. To train one of its more recent models, the company was forced to use Nvidia H800 chips, a less-powerful version of a chip, the H100, available to U.S. companies. DeepSeek‚Äôs technical team is said to skew young. The company reportedly aggressively recruits doctorate AI researchers from top Chinese universities. DeepSeek also hires people without any computer science background to help its tech better understand a wide range of subjects, per The New York Times. DeepSeek unveiled its first set of models ‚Äî DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat ‚Äî in November 2023. But it wasn‚Äôt until last spring, when the startup released its next-gen DeepSeek-V2 family of models, that the AI industry started to take notice. DeepSeek-V2, a general-purpose text- and image-analyzing system, performed well in various AI benchmarks ‚Äî and was far cheaper to run than comparable models at the time. It forced DeepSeek‚Äôs domestic competition, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to cut the usage prices for some of their models, and make others completely free. DeepSeek-V3, launched in December 2024, only added to DeepSeek‚Äôs notoriety. According to DeepSeek‚Äôs internal benchmark testing, DeepSeek V3 outperforms both downloadable, openly available models like Meta‚Äôs Llama and ‚Äúclosed‚Äù models that can only be accessed through an API, like OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o. Equally impressive is DeepSeek‚Äôs R1 ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù model. Released in January, DeepSeek claims R1 performs as well as OpenAI‚Äôs o1 model on key benchmarks. Being a reasoning model, R1 effectively fact-checks itself, which helps it to avoid some of the pitfalls that normally trip up models. Reasoning models take a little longer ‚Äî usually seconds to minutes longer ‚Äî to arrive at solutions compared to a typical non-reasoning model. The upside is that they tend to be more reliable in domains such as physics, science, and math. There is a downside to R1, DeepSeek V3, and DeepSeek‚Äôs other models, however. Being Chinese-developed AI, they‚Äôre subject to benchmarking by China‚Äôs internet regulator to ensure that its responses ‚Äúembody core socialist values.‚Äù In DeepSeek‚Äôs chatbot app, for example, R1 won‚Äôt answer questions about Tiananmen Square or Taiwan‚Äôs autonomy. In March, DeepSeek surpassed 16.5 million visits. ‚Äú[F]or March, DeepSeek is in second place, despite seeing traffic drop 25% from where it was in February, based on daily visits,‚Äù David Carr, editor at Similarweb, told TechCrunch. It still pales in comparison to ChatGPT, which surged past 500 million weekly active users in March. In May, DeepSeek released an updated version of its R1 reasoning AI model on the developer platform Hugging Face. DeepSeek unveiled a new experimental model called V3.2-exp in September, designed to have dramatically lower inference costs when used in long-context operations. If DeepSeek has a business model, it‚Äôs not clear what that model is, exactly. The company prices its products and services well below market value ‚Äî and gives others away for free. It‚Äôs also not taking investor money, despite a ton of VC interest. The way DeepSeek tells it, efficiency breakthroughs have enabled it to maintain extreme cost competitiveness. Some experts dispute the figures the company has supplied, however. Whatever the case may be, developers have taken to DeepSeek‚Äôs models, which aren‚Äôt open source as the phrase is commonly understood but are available under permissive licenses that allow for commercial use. According to Clem Delangue, the CEO of Hugging Face, one of the platforms hosting DeepSeek‚Äôs models, developers on Hugging Face have created over 500 ‚Äúderivative‚Äù models of R1 that have racked up 2.5 million downloads combined. DeepSeek‚Äôs success against larger and more established rivals has been described as ‚Äúupending AI‚Äù and ‚Äúover-hyped.‚Äù The company‚Äôs success was at least in part responsible for causing Nvidia‚Äôs stock price to drop by 18% in January, and for eliciting a public response from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. In March, U.S. Commerce department bureaus told staffers that DeepSeek will be banned on their government devices, according to Reuters. Microsoft announced that DeepSeek is available on its Azure AI Foundry service, Microsoft‚Äôs platform that brings together AI services for enterprises under a single banner. When asked about DeepSeek‚Äôs impact on Meta‚Äôs AI spending during its first-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said spending on AI infrastructure will continue to be a ‚Äústrategic advantage‚Äù for Meta. In March, OpenAI called DeepSeek ‚Äústate-subsidized‚Äù and ‚Äústate-controlled,‚Äù and recommends that the U.S. government consider banning models from DeepSeek. During Nvidia‚Äôs fourth-quarter earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang emphasized DeepSeek‚Äôs ‚Äúexcellent innovation,‚Äù saying that it and other ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù models are great for Nvidia because they need so much more compute. At the same time, some companies are banning DeepSeek, and so are entire countries and governments, including South Korea. New York state also banned DeepSeek from being used on government devices. In May, Microsoft vice chairman and president Brad Smith said in a Senate hearing that Microsoft employees aren‚Äôt allowed to use DeepSeek due to data security and propaganda concerns. As for what DeepSeek‚Äôs future might hold, it‚Äôs not clear. Improved models are a given. But the U.S. government appears to be growing wary of what it perceives as harmful foreign influence. In March, The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. will likely ban DeepSeek on government devices. This story was originally published January 28, 2025, and will be updated regularly.

Eva is a fellow on Fortune's news desk. Just as Open AI CEO Sam Altman and Meta leader Mark Zuckerberg begin acknowledging that there may be truth to the warnings of an AI bubble, Jensen Huang is doubling down on his bullishness. In a recent podcast appearance with Bill Gurley and Brad Gerstner, the Nvidia CEO brushed aside the growing caution and instead zeroed in on the company he sees as the next dominant force: OpenAI. ‚ÄúOpenAI is very likely going to be the world‚Äôs next multitrillion-dollar hyperscale company,‚Äù Huang said. That bold prediction comes at a moment when even AI‚Äôs loudest evangelists are warning of overvaluation and overbuilding. Altman himself has cautioned that too much money is flooding into unproven AI ventures, while Zuckerberg has compared today‚Äôs infrastructure frenzy to past bubbles. Yet Huang insists the skeptics are missing the deeper forces reshaping the economy. In his telling, the story comes down to basic physics, not hype.‚ÄúGeneral-purpose computing is over,‚Äù Huang said, describing what he sees as a generational shift in how all industries will run. ‚ÄúThe future is accelerated computing and AI.‚Äù He outlined what he calls the ‚Äúthree scaling laws‚Äù of AI‚Äîpretraining, post-training, and inference‚Äîeach of which exponentially increases demand for compute. While training workloads have already been well-documented, Huang stressed that inference‚Äîthe real-time reasoning that underpins everything from chatbots to recommendation algorithms‚Äîis only just beginning. ‚ÄúThe longer you think, the better the answer you get‚Äîand thinking requires more compute,‚Äù he explained. That framing matters because inference is where AI collides with day-to-day usage. Training runs happen in bursts, but inference happens constantly: Every chatbot prompt, every AI video render, every background algorithmic tweak consumes processing power. If Huang is right, that relentless demand means AI won‚Äôt follow the boom-and-bust cycles of earlier technologies but will instead drive a compounding need, one that will also boost Nvidia. Huang‚Äôs comments came just days after Nvidia announced its most audacious deal yet: a $100 billion investment in OpenAI to help fund the company‚Äôs massive data center build-out. It‚Äôs the largest example of what analysts call Nvidia‚Äôs ‚Äúcircular financing‚Äù strategy, in which it invests in, or lends to, customers who in turn spend billions on Nvidia‚Äôs GPUs. To Huang, it‚Äôs a smart way to align incentives with a once-in-a-generation partner scaling faster than any company in history. ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs the case, the opportunity to invest before they get there is one of the smartest investments we can imagine,‚Äù he said. But to markets, the sheer size of the commitment was jarring. Deutsche Bank had previously warned that 2025 could be remembered as ‚Äúthe summer AI turned ugly,‚Äù pointing to the risk that circular revenue-recognition games could inflate demand. Deutsche Bank analysts said Nvidia‚Äôs way of helping fund its own customers reminds them of past bubbles, when companies juiced sales by essentially paying buyers to buy their products.They warned that even if these deals are only a small slice of revenue right now, Nvidia is so big that any slipup could shake the whole stock market. As they put it, the stock is ‚Äúpriced for perfection,‚Äù which means there‚Äôs not much room for mistakes if AI growth cools off. That tension helps explain why Altman, despite running Nvidia‚Äôs most important customer, has been publicly warning of ‚Äúa frenzy of cash chasing anything labeled AI.‚Äù And Zuckerberg, while still pouring billions into Meta‚Äôs own AI ambitions, has likewise admitted the infrastructure build-out carries ‚Äúbubble-like‚Äù characteristics reminiscent of railroads and the dotcom era. Even Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has taken note, pointing to the ‚Äúunusually large amounts of economic activity‚Äù flowing into AI, a rare signal that the froth is on the Fed‚Äôs radar. Huang remains unmoved. To him, these warnings miss the forest for the trees. He insists that Nvidia and OpenAI‚Äôs growth is propelled by scaling laws and performance per watt‚Äîfundamentals that make his company the only rational choice for hyperscalers. ‚ÄúThis is the industrial revolution,‚Äù he told Gurley and Gerstner, a common refrain from Huang on the subject of AI. Huang also seemed to flip his stance on President Donald Trump‚Äôs recent $100,000 H-1B visa fee. He called the policy ‚Äúa great start‚Äù for cracking down on visa abuse and illegal immigration, but cautioned that the steep price tag ‚Äúprobably sets the bar a little too high.‚Äù For Huang, himself an immigrant, Trump‚Äôs fee may be a useful first step, but only if it‚Äôs paired with broader reforms that keep America attractive to top talent. ¬© 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

This is Naked Capitalism fundraising week. 401 donors have already invested in our efforts to combat corruption and predatory conduct, particularly in the financial realm. Please join us and participate via our donation page, which shows how to give via check, credit card, debit card, PayPal, Clover, or Wise. Read about why we‚Äôre doing this fundraiser, what we‚Äôve accomplished in the last year, and our current goal, supporting our new Coffee Break/Sunday Movie features The western powers seem to be making competing desperate bids to maintain narrative control, and it is very hard to parse the difference between deliberate deception, delusion, and what is just plain dipshittery. I‚Äôll talk about Europe and the Trump‚Äôs administration‚Äôs efforts in future posts, but this post will look at Israel‚Äôs efforts on what Alistair Crooke calls their ‚Äú8th front:‚Äù their battle to control the narrative in the United States. Crooke also insists they are losing in that battle. The Times of Israel agrees. Also a note re the sourcing and quotes in this post. The narrative is being contested online. It‚Äôs been my practice to use X.com (formerly Twitter) and YouTube to monitor other social media such as Instagram, TikTok, Telegram, Twitch, etc. Much of this story is being contested on Twitter so this post features a higher than usual % of Twitter embeds, apologies if that‚Äôs inconvenient for you. If you‚Äôd like me to quote from the tweets separately please let me know in the comments. I‚Äôm also embedding tweets from a variety of sources, embeds are not endorsements. Some of these accounts are anonymous and none of them (or any source) should ever be trusted implicitly, nor are they necessarily ‚Äúallies‚Äù of this community (if there is such a thing). I‚Äôve tried to select relevant sources and well-documented posts that advance the story I‚Äôm trying to tell. Israel‚Äôs desperate push to maintain narrative control in the U.S. Many are, including the President of Iran, anticipating a renewed Israeli attack on Iran and support for Israel plummeting in the U.S., especially among Democrats and young people, including young Republicans. Understandably, these two factors have Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu ramping up his efforts to control the narrative in America. Tucker Carlson went on Glenn Greenwald‚Äôs Rumble channel and claimed that Netanyahu is ‚Äúgoing around the Middle East‚Äù and bragging that he controls the U.S. and Donald Trump. This is not the behavior of a secure player, confident in his powers. This is the voice of dangerous desperation, delusion and maybe some dipshittery too. JUST IN: Tucker Carlson says he knows for 100% FACT that Netanyahu is telling people in the Middle East: ‚ÄúI CONTROL the United States, and I CONTROL Donald Trump‚Äù pic.twitter.com/VIBhir6XTE ‚Äî Sulaiman Ahmed (@ShaykhSulaiman_) September 25, 2025 Bibi‚Äôs has also been meeting with influencers and bragging openly about Israel‚Äôs control of TikTok (via the Oracle acquisition) and X.com. I‚Äôll quote the Aaron Mate tweet that he used to introduce the below: ‚ÄúLiberals and many progressives spent years fixated on mythical Russian oligarchs controlling US democracy and equally mythical ‚ÄúRussian interference‚Äù flooding our information system. ‚ÄúAll along, the actual foreign interference was right in front of their dupe faces:‚Äù Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu briefed American influencers on TikTok, calling it the ‚Äúmost important‚Äù weapon in securing support for Israel on the right-wing. He went on to say, ‚ÄúWeapons change over time‚Ä¶ the most important ones are the social media,‚Äù and, ‚Äúthe most important‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/0gfX9Hikzj ‚Äî AF Post (@AFpost) September 27, 2025 Influencer Dipshittery While not as important as the TikTok deal, Netanyahu has also embarked on an ‚Äúinfluencer-heavy‚Äù approach to influencing young American public opinion. Not only do social media influences reach a multiple of Americans under 35 than that reached by the MSM, influencers are also often ignorant of politics and sometimes utterly amoral and therefore happy to sign up to support genocide. Bibi recently hosted a number of American influencers. The Prime Minister of Israel official X account tweeted Bibi‚Äôs trophy shots from the meeting: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met, after his UN General Assembly speech, with pro-Israel influencers and spoke with them about the challenges in the new era, and the public diplomacy efforts and the influence of the social networks on the discourse for and against Israel. pic.twitter.com/SX397fx7hn ‚Äî Prime Minister of Israel (@IsraeliPM) September 28, 2025 Naturally online critics of Israel were quick to document which influencers Bibi got to, here‚Äôs one effort by a right-wing X user (the thread on X includes later additions): REVEALED: Netanyahu's Private Meeting of Influencers at the israeli Embassy to help "take over Tiktok and Twitter" ‚ñ™Ô∏èYair Netanyahu‚ñ™Ô∏èEmily Austin ‚ñ™Ô∏èDebra Lea Schwartzben ‚ñ™Ô∏èjudeanceo: Shay Szabo‚ñ™Ô∏èLizzy Savetsky‚ñ™Ô∏èThatZionistGirl: _thatopinionatedgirl_ (name unknown)‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/pWOznACDpn ‚Äî Sam Parker üá∫üá∏üßØ (@BasedSamParker) September 27, 2025 Some of these people are real gems: Emily Wilson aka Emily Saves America attended the secret Hamptons influencer summit with Bill Ackman, and was then flown off to Israel for a propaganda tour Before Israel recruited her, she declared support for Alabama re-instituting chattel slavery pic.twitter.com/Q5fGA5UBiR ‚Äî Max Blumenthal (@MaxBlumenthal) September 28, 2025 Different Emily but this one got right to work cranking out real cringe on behalf of Bibi, she‚Äôs also hooked up with Hollywood agents: Emily Austin is represented by Casey Wasserman, a top pro-Israel fundraiser for the Democratic Party https://t.co/BxSd6L4GhW ‚Äî Max Blumenthal (@MaxBlumenthal) September 28, 2025 We‚Äôll have more from Max on Israel‚Äôs Hollywood moves further down in the post. But I wanted to share one more seeming fail from another of Bibi‚Äôs newly activated influencers, social media is not sending their best: Her followers weren‚Äôt having any of it https://t.co/3OaD3VtgEw pic.twitter.com/5FKOpI9i2B ‚Äî Mel (@Villgecrazylady) September 28, 2025 There‚Äôs also the very important matter of getting the right person in the Turning Point USA frontman role once filled by Charlie Kirk. Let‚Äôs not forget that Netanyahu was one of the first to post about the death of Kirk, with a very polished tweet, written on a day when Israel was engaged in military attacks on seven neighbors. Charlie Kirk was murdered for speaking truth and defending freedom. A lion-hearted friend of Israel, he fought the lies and stood tall for Judeo-Christian civilization. I spoke to him only two weeks ago and invited him to Israel. Sadly, that visit will not take place.We lost an‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Benjamin Netanyahu ‚Äì ◊ë◊†◊ô◊û◊ô◊ü ◊†◊™◊†◊ô◊î◊ï (@netanyahu) September 10, 2025 He‚Äôs since gone on to deny that Israel had any role in Kirk‚Äôs death: Charlie Kirk was a great man.

Max Blumenthal: "No. And I've never seen anything like what Netanyahu was doing after a tragedy‚Ä¶since 9/11." pic.twitter.com/fgdKyyldIt ‚Äî James Li (@5149jamesli) September 14, 2025 Ben Shapiro is running the show at TPUSA. He was quick to announce it, in terms of ‚Äúpicking up the blood-stained mic‚Äù, posting on September 11, the day after Kirk‚Äôs death. A post shared by Ben Shapiro (@officialbenshapiro) He‚Äôs been accused of buying that controlling role at the organization, a move that was sewed up by September 15. Ben Shapiro‚Äôs donation of $1M is why they kiIIed Charlie. Now TPUSA remains Zionist. Charlie was AGAINST war with Iran. Ben supports it. You can bet TPUSA will now push for a war with Iran. Ben is a Mossad parasite. This is a hostile takeover. pic.twitter.com/Dm2HntzGtZ ‚Äî ADAM (@AdameMedia) September 17, 2025 Given that Shapiro‚Äôs Daily Wire has allegedly been declining in viewership (Google trends) since he lost Candace Owens over her opposition to Gaza, but he needs a fresh gentile face to be a credible frontman for the young MAGA crowd: It is abundantly clear that the RNC is enforcing a controlled Charlie Kirk on Turning Point USA. Charlie Kirk, who was the only agent of change against the RNC at a grassroots level, is now being replaced by someone nobody had heard of They say ‚ÄúBrilyn Hollyhand is the next‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/FV2DhBlldb ‚Äî Aidan (@aidanxitter) September 28, 2025 Hollyhand also appears backed by staffers for some notorious AIPAC US Congressmen: You know who‚Äôs backing ‚ÄúCharlie Kirk‚Äôs protege (who Charlie Kirk never reposted)‚Äù?

He reeks of the cultural tropes of the Old South aristocracy (ie the slave lords), a caste that has wealth and power but hasn‚Äôt had significant cultural influence in the U.S. since the Civil War: The Left‚Äôs silence during the protests at Columbia and Yale has made their stance perfectly clear: Democrats are Anti-Israel and pro "Death to America" chants. Republicans proudly stand with Israel and condem this hateful rhetoric. pic.twitter.com/DUxBtk2yj1 ‚Äî Brilyn Hollyhand (@BrilynHollyhand) April 30, 2024 At the University of Texas we‚Äôd describe someone like Hollyhand as ‚Äúputting off strong Kappa Alpha, Birmingham chapter, vibes.‚Äù UPDATE: Hollyhand might be overstating his relationship with TPSUA. Hollywood Hasbara And it‚Äôs not just influencers, there is plenty of work to be done on the MSM side and Israel has been busy there, too. Max Blumenthal tweeted a list of ‚ÄúHollywood hasbara‚Äù: The Hollywood hasbara is coming hard and fast as Israel loses control of the narrative A Paramount propaganda series on October 7 A (postponed) AppleTV show glorifying the ADL The new season of AppleTV‚Äôs news-focused Morning Show demonizes Iran while ignoring Gaza pic.twitter.com/FYYddwEOGR ‚Äî Max Blumenthal (@MaxBlumenthal) September 28, 2025 Paramount is all in, there‚Äôs this documentary: pic.twitter.com/o1omvQKu8j ‚Äî Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) September 29, 2025 And a new mini-series on October 7, per The Hollywood Reporter: Paramount+ has released the harrowing first trailer for an upcoming four-part limited series depicting the Oct. 7, 2023 tragedy in Israel. The project is titled Red Alert and it portrays the largest and deadliest massacre in Israel‚Äôs history, when more than 1,200 concert-goers, families and individuals near the Gaza border were murdered and 250 were kidnapped by Hamas. The show‚Äôs production credits include Pulp Fiction producer Lawrence Bender and Homeland producer Keshet Media Group. Red Alert is ‚Äúdraws from the true experiences of those who survived and weaves their courageous personal stories into a cinematic narrative of the devastating terrorist attack that turned southern Israel into a war zone, testing humanity and forging heroism through chaos.‚Äù Kirk‚Äôs death has slowed at least one Hollywood hasbara effort, per the New York Times: Apple TV+ has postponed the release of its show ‚ÄúThe Savant,‚Äù starring Jessica Chastain as an undercover investigator who infiltrates online hate groups to stop mass shootings. The show was set to begin streaming its first two episodes on Friday. Apple did not give a reason for its postponement, which it announced on Tuesday, saying in a brief statement only that the decision was made after ‚Äúcareful consideration.‚Äù It did not announce a new release date. Two people with knowledge of the discussions said that the company was reluctant to release the show in the current political climate, after the assassination of Charlie Kirk this month. The most important of all: Oracle, Paramount, and TikTok I‚Äôll close with what I opened with, the importance to Netanyahu and Israel of the new TikTok ownership. Israel is currently being blamed for the wave of anti-Chinese propaganda that provided the ostensible reason for last year‚Äôs U.S. Congressional vote to ban TikTok unless it changed owners: Did You Know Zionists Were Behind the TikTok CCP Narrative 1) Oct-Dec 2023, TikTok was top app for Israel truth 2) Dec 2023, Zionist tech investor Anthony Goldbloom commissioned NCRI (Israeli funded/managed NGO) to produce a report claiming China‚Äôs CCP controls TikTok. After‚Ä¶ https://t.co/adlraAQOTA pic.twitter.com/nm41Xm8Wjg ‚Äî GenXGirl (@GenXGirl1994) September 28, 2025 We also must discuss the role of Larry Ellison, David Ellison and the new Oracle nepo-ownership of Paramount in pulling that off. Wired is quoting ‚Äúa Trump advisor‚Äù who calls Larry Ellison, a ‚ÄúShadow president‚Äù: In an age where human attention is perhaps the world‚Äôs most valuable commodity, the Ellisons could be in charge of almost everything a modern-day pseudo robber barron could want by the end of this year or soon after. I spoke with sources who have dealt with Ellison‚Äîas well as others who know his son, David‚Äîto get a sense of how he operates. And he operates a lot lately‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs his pending dominance over vertical video with a key role in the proposed new ownership consortium for the US version of TikTok, for which Oracle‚Äôs servers already provide hosting. There‚Äôs airwave domination, with a news and entertainment behemoth under his son‚Äôs control following the merger of David‚Äôs Skydance and Paramount‚Äîwhich might possibly include the keys to not only CBS, but also CNN, if Skydance actually puts in a bid and succeeds in a potential acquisition of Warner Brothers-Discovery. The empire spans from the sweaty floor of the octagon after acquiring US broadcast rights to the Ultimate Fighting Championship (also under Paramount) all the way to the clay soil of Abilene, Texas, home of OpenAI‚Äôs Stargate data center project led by Oracle and Softbank. Oracle is also linked to a $100 billion deal with Nvidia and OpenAI announced Monday. The Ellison family is cornering the market on attention and data the way the Vanderbilts did railroads and the Rockefellers did oil. I‚Äôve posted previously about Ellison, Oracle, Paramount, Israel, and the Trump administration. I‚Äôve also previously posted about the role of the Trump administration in pressuring Paramount‚Äôs previous owner Shari Redstone to sell to the Ellisons. I‚Äôve also cited the work of The MMA Draw which explained the role of Ellison ally Ari Emanuel in getting Trump to support that move. Emanuel is a top Trump insider, a combat sports multi-monopolist (mixed martial arts, pro wrestling, and moving to take over boxing), Hollywood power broker, and brother of Democratic presidential aspirant Rahm Emanuel. Emanuel is also at the center of a web of financiers that is deeply involved in the new Paramount, per Zach Arnold at The MMA Draw: Ari Emanuel is focused entirely on controlling the politics and the plumbing of media pipes. He has deep ties to ESPN & Netflix. There are still ties with NBCUniversal. And now Paramount is on the table. Since the take-private of Endeavor, Gerry Cardinale of Redbird Capital has emerged as Ari Emanuel‚Äôs key financial muscle. Redbird Capital is a principle investor in Skydance, the Larry & David Ellison shop that is taking over Paramount from Shari Redstone. Guess who is now going to be running management in Paramount? Guess who‚Äôs going to be on Paramount‚Äôs Board of Directors? Andy Gordon, former heavyweight from Goldman Sachs, is now COO and Chief Strategist (Redbird) at Paramount. Justin Hamill, Chief Legal Officer of Silver Lake, is going to be on Paramount‚Äôs BOD. Silver Lake and Mubadala are the main financiers behind Endeavor. Heads, Ari wins; tails, you lose. That‚Äôs how this works. Mubadala is the UAE‚Äôs financial vehicle and Silver Lake (which owns most of WME Group, the parent company of Emanuel‚Äôs fight empire TKO) is reportedly to be Oracle‚Äôs new partner in the TikTok acquisition: A group of three investors, including Oracle and private-equity firm Silver Lake, will take a roughly 50% stake in TikTok U.S., a source familiar with the deal said on Thursday. A group of existing shareholders in TikTok‚Äôs Chinese parent, ByteDance, will hold a roughly 30% stake, the source said. Among ByteDance‚Äôs current investors are Susquehanna International Group, General Atlantic and KKR. ‚Ä¶ CNBC reported earlier that Abu Dhabi-based MGX, Oracle and Silver Lake are poised to be the main investors in TikTok U.S. with a combined 45% ownership, citing sources. MGX did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the CNBC report. MGX is an artificial intelligence investment firm and a partner of Silver Lake, and falls under the purview of Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the United Arab Emirates‚Äô national security adviser and brother of the President Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The AI and surveillance delusions of Larry Ellison It‚Äôs fairly well established that Israeli PM Netanyahu is delusional on many topics whether it‚Äôs Israel‚Äôs status as a world power, Israel‚Äôs ability to cut off trade with Egypt, or his vision of Israel as a autarkic ‚ÄúSuper-Sparta.‚Äù I do want to highlight the fundamental desperation that is driving Netanyahu, as Imran Khalid ably described in May: By now, it should surprise no one that Benjamin Netanyahu prefers the echo chamber of his own making to the international chorus demanding accountability. The Israeli prime minister, clinging to office as tenaciously as he clings to delusion, has managed to place himself among the most cynically manipulative leaders of our time, a man who governs not by vision, but by vindictiveness. Once vaunted as a statesman in the mold of Churchill, Netanyahu now more closely resembles a bunker-dwelling autocrat, lashing out at allies and adversaries alike as his credibility collapses under the weight of his own contradictions. ‚Ä¶ Netanyahu thrives in crisis, not to resolve it but to prolong it, using chaos as a shield against the ever-looming specter of his own political demise. With corruption charges still dogging him and public opinion slipping, he has fashioned Gaza into both a battlefield and a diversion. ‚Ä¶ He is a leader in free fall, dragging his country with him, increasingly abandoned by allies, and yet still believing himself the indispensable man. The tragedy is not only his. It belongs to Israel‚Äîand to all those, Palestinian and Israeli alike, who must live with the consequences of his delusions. But I‚Äôd rather focus on some of the delusions and desperation that may be driving Larry Ellison. First, he‚Äôs becoming quite well known as one of the leading spokesmen (alongside Palantir‚Äôs Alex Karp and Peter Thiel) for a vision of security through surveillance: The man behind the digital ID push is Larry Ellison, owner of Oracle, CBS, CNN, and, soon, TikTok. He wants data centralization and total surveillance. "Citizens will be on their best behavior because we're constantly watching & recording everything that's going on." Terrifying. https://t.co/mb05XvnOAx pic.twitter.com/cUx45ORy2F ‚Äî Michael Shellenberger (@shellenberger) September 27, 2025 The above may be deception rather than delusion, but if so, Ellison is revealing a great deal about himself to the public and its being widely used against him and his allies (I‚Äôll discuss the backlash to Oracle‚Äôs role in the UK‚Äôs just announced Digital ID plan in my next post tomorrow morning). As for the desperation, well Oracle is taking out billions of dollars in debt to pay for their AI aspirations, per Yahoo Finance on Sept. 24: Oracle Corp. sold $18 billion US investment-grade bonds on Wednesday, the market‚Äôs second-largest deal this year, as the software maker ramps up its spending to meet the needs of the artificial intelligence boom. Demand peaked at nearly $88 billion, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The technology giant ‚Äî which has nearly doubled in value this year ‚Äî is issuing debt in six parts, including a rare 40-year bond, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified discussing private details. That note will yield 1.37 percentage points above similarly dated Treasuries, compared with initial price talk of about 1.65 percentage points. A floating-rate tranche was dropped during syndication. The debt raise comes as Oracle begins to fulfill massive cloud infrastructure deals with customers like OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc., which are boosting the company‚Äôs expenses. Over the next several years, it is projected to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to rent and power data centers. It is also the cloud provider to TikTok in the US, and under a new framework outlined by the White House earlier this week, it would help oversee the development of a new US-only version of the social media giant‚Äôs algorithm. The software company spent years trailing the top three vendors ‚Äî Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google ‚Äî in the competitive cloud infrastructure market. Now that it has struck serious cloud deals, it‚Äôs on the hook for upfront costs. Oracle‚Äôs cash flow flipped negative this year for the first time since 1992. Analysts anticipate the metric will be in free fall over the coming years before returning to positive in 2029. Oracle and OpenAI announced a $300 billion cloud deal on September 10 (that was truly a historic day) that initially goosed Oracle‚Äôs stock price significantly. The Wall Street Journal had the scoop: OpenAI signed a contract with Oracle to purchase $300 billion in computing power over roughly five years, people familiar with the matter said, a massive commitment that far outstrips the startup‚Äôs current revenue. The deal is one of the largest cloud contracts ever signed, reflecting how spending on AI data centers is hitting new highs despite mounting concerns over a potential bubble. The Oracle contract will require 4.5 gigawatts of power capacity, roughly comparable to the electricity produced by more than two Hoover Dams or the amount consumed by about four million homes. Oracle shares surged by as much as 43% on Wednesday after the cloud company revealed it added $317 billion in future contract revenue during its latest quarter that ended in Aug. 31. Chief Executive Safra Catz told analysts that it had signed contracts with three different customers during the quarter. The share price surge increased Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison‚Äôs wealth by more than $100 billion, pushing him into the range of Elon Musk as the world‚Äôs richest person, with a net worth of almost $400 billion. The OpenAI and Oracle contract, which starts in 2027, is a risky gamble for both companies. OpenAI is a money-losing startup that disclosed in June it was generating roughly $10 billion in annual revenue‚Äîless than one-fifth of the $60 billion it will have to pay on average every year. Oracle is concentrating a large chunk of its future revenue on one customer‚Äîand will likely have to take on debt to buy the AI chips needed to power the data centers. Ed Zitron ripped the deal, calling it ‚Äúfull of crap‚Äù: Analysts fawned over Oracle ‚Äî again, as it missed estimates ‚Äî with TD Cowen‚Äôs Derrick Wood saying it was a ‚Äúmomentous quarter‚Äù (again, it missed) and that these numbers were ‚Äúreally amazing to see,‚Äù and Guggenheim Securities‚Äô John DiFucci said he was ‚Äúblown away.‚Äù Deutsche Bank‚Äôs Brad Zelnick added that ‚Äú[analysts] were all kind of in shock, in a very good way.‚Äù RPOs, while standard (and required) accounting practice and based on actual signed contracts, are being used by Oracle as a form of marketing. Plans change, contracts can be canceled (usually with a kill fee, but nevertheless), and, especially in this case, clients can either not have the money to pay or die for the very same reason they can‚Äôt pay. In Oracle‚Äôs case, it isn‚Äôt simply promising ridiculous growth, it is effectively saying it‚Äôll become the dominant player in all cloud compute. Oracle claims that it will make $18 billion in cloud infrastructure revenue in FY2026, $32 billion in FY2027, $73 billion in FY2028, $114 billion in FY2029, and $144 billion in FY2030. While all of this isn‚Äôt necessarily OpenAI (as it adds up to $381 billion), it‚Äôs fair to assume that the majority of it is. This means ‚Äî as the $300 billion of the $317 billion of new contracts added by Oracle, and assuming OpenAI makes up 78% of its cloud infrastructure revenue ($300 billion out of $381 billion) ‚Äî that OpenAI intends to spend over $88 billion fucking dollars in compute by FY2029, and $110 billion dollars in compute, AKA nearly as much as Amazon Web Services makes in a year, in FY2030. Now that stock price froth is beginning to fade with a 16% drop in Oracle‚Äôs share price last week, per Technobezz: Sometimes the market‚Äôs most beloved darlings get hit the hardest when reality comes knocking. Oracle just learned this lesson the hard way, watching its stock price plummet 16% from recent highs as analysts started asking uncomfortable questions about those sky-high AI promises. The damage started this week when Rothschild & Redburn analyst Alex Haissl dropped a bombshell coverage initiation, slapping Oracle with a rare ‚ÄúSell‚Äù rating and a $175 price target. That‚Äôs not just pessimistic ‚Äì it‚Äôs predicting roughly 40% downside from current levels. According to The Motley Fool, shares that were trading above $308 just days ago have already tumbled to around $291, and according to multiple analyst reports, this might just be the beginning. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs got Wall Street spooked: Oracle has floated aggressive targets for cloud growth, with executives outlining a path for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue to reach about $18 billion this fiscal year and scale toward $144 billion by fiscal 2030. That‚Äôs ambitious against the company‚Äôs most recent quarter showing total revenue of $15.9 billion and cloud services and license support of $11.7 billion. The numbers tell a more nuanced story than Oracle‚Äôs executives might prefer. While the company did post respectable 11% revenue growth in Q4, with cloud services jumping 14% to $11.7 billion, the valuation has gotten completely divorced from fundamentals. According to Seeking Alpha analysts, Oracle now trades at a forward P/E ratio of 41-46 ‚Äì compare that to the industry median of 29, or even Nvidia‚Äôs 50 (despite Nvidia‚Äôs 50%+ revenue growth rate). That disconnect becomes even more stark when you consider the broader context. A recent MIT study found that 95% of companies investing in generative AI have yet to see any financial returns. Yet Oracle‚Äôs stock had been riding high on promises of triple-digit growth in its multicloud revenue, with CEO Larry Ellison boasting about building 47 new data centers in the next 12 months. The confluence of the AI bubble, the rot economy, what I‚Äôve called ‚ÄúThe Interregnum of Unreality‚Äù with Israel‚Äôs desperate, deceptive, delusional attempts to control the American political system shows how the polycrisis impacts everyone. I‚Äôd like to justify my focus on Larry Ellison‚Äôs role in this process by referencing an insight from a DropSite News writer Waqas on X who was discussing the relationship between Jeffrey Epstein and Israel, but I think it‚Äôs apropos for Ellison as well: Epstein himself was a supranational entity floating above it all with access to networks and finance that is impossible to put together by a single individual. If you consider Israel a proper country and a nation, you would fall into the trap of thinking that Epstein worked for Mossad, working for the interests of Israel. But consider this for a second and redo your calculations just to see if it makes sense: Israel is not a regular country, it is an entity that exists to provide sovereign cover to a network of billionaires and allows them a financial and regulatory home base that can circumvent international laws and local laws in other countries. Even ordinary Israeli citizens are victims of and are being used by this entity. In this system, Epstein is a part of a network that all these people named in the emails are also a part of. They make international deals on behalf of each other and share resources. Israel is a sub structure that allows all this. Mossad then is just an intelligence arm of this loose confederation of billionaires. I‚Äôll continue this mini-series tomorrow morning with a look at the delusion, deception and dipshittery involved with the information war being fought by the EU, the UK, and Ukraine to control the European population and keep the US deeply involved on their increasingly irrelevant subcontinent. Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. Anecdata to your last point, Nat: a good decade ago my silly sister invested in a scam spun out of illegal sports betting websites on Cyprus that evolved into stock price-calling on a daily-weekly-whatever basis, where you guess if a price would go up or down, period, called binary options trading. This industry became somewhat regulated on Cyprus, so it moved to Israel, where its practices were spread around the world by immigrants who spoke no Hebrew, but knew how to sell bubbles and BS back home. Tel Aviv was the capital of this industry, and its only regulation was that it was illegal for salesmen to sell to Israelis. That‚Äôs it. As long as the calls were international, no regs. It‚Äôs a cute, minor example of the service system DropSite describes. I guess it‚Äôs true, it sure worked on my sister (who‚Äôd dragged me in too because I wanted to show my love . . .) Yes, we lost everything, then our salesman ‚Äòdied.‚Äô I‚Äôd like to think that judging by their crappy accounting software, Oracle won‚Äôt be a dominant player in anything. But that software enjoys a 5-10% market share in its industry and I know of at least one company that gladly overpaid millions of dollars to install it. Are Tiktok watchers savvier than CEOs and will they know crap when they see it, and tune out? A guy can dream. On a somewhat positive note, now that Ellison has swallowed up CNN, it might be a little easier to convince a few holdouts I know that CNN is in fact a propaganda network, and not a middle of the road independent news source. Obviously not shown in any of these (esp not propaganda flicks/stuff coming out of Hollywood thst is): IDF gunships massacring more Jews than ever around 10/7 since SS was still active‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not trying to be negative, but does this seem like a very weird and out-of-character piece for NC? Maybe it‚Äôs just me. Sorry you feel that way. It was an attempt to build on my piece on the online aftermath of the Charlie Kirk killing: Doomscrolling the Influencer Apocalypse which was quite well received by the commenters and my colleagues here. How many are noticing and decrying the whole narrative thing? Wasn‚Äôt bad enough with US media cheerleading lying BS nonsense? Now international clapp-trap apps by more wannabe self-promoting Platonic Manipulation Class best and brightest to tell us paroles, plebes and unwashed what to think. Any wonder about disillusionment, and desire for change? Eff‚Äôem all, and the narratives they rode in on. Say, Waaaa? A worthy addition to NC Keep up the fine work, Nat: this long-time NC-er appreciates it muchly. Reporting of this quality, with background and deeper context for news worthy events of the day, served with links to evidence of skulduggery in plain sight and further links to other useful reporting‚Ä¶. Although does Ben Shapiro have a millions bucks of his own money with no string attached? It should be presumed Ben would be acting as a bagman for various billionaires This is a ‚Äúyellow waders‚Äù (nee Lambert) style write up ‚Ä¶ and I love it. Perhaps the only difference is the emphasis of content from X, which Nat did call out. People who‚Äôve been paying attention should understand that what‚Äôs playing out online is a major reason for concern among the consent manufacturers. Wake up. Less and less people are glued to boob tube ‚Ä¶ Exhibit A: MSNBC, CNN & Fox News Ratings: Dramatic Drops & Most-Watched Shows (via TVInsider) Excerpts (key 25 ‚Äì 54 demographic #‚Äôs): ‚Ä¢ Fox News was down 30% in total viewers and 48% in the key demo ‚Ä¢ MSNBC down 26% and in the [key] demo, down 37% ‚Ä¢ CNN down 29% and in the key [demo] down 44% Online is where the (increasingly anti-war, pro-Palestine) discourse is getting amplified. This is why TikTok was made to surrender to American (and by extension Ni0n1sT) control. This is probably why EA just went private. Young people are abandoning support for Israel and this is a threat to the horrid, inhumane, warmongering status quo. Yes, it feels like a clear spiritual successor to those for me: here is a thing that I don‚Äôt understand/isn‚Äôt receiving sufficient coverage/is at odds with what‚Äôs being reported in the media/etc., here‚Äôs my attempt to dig into it and figure it out, commenter input/participation welcome. In this case it‚Äôs the rabbit hole of social media influencers and how they shape narratives around current events, which I freely admit is something I understand not at all, so I welcome the attempt. There‚Äôs definitely something pathological out there, probably multiple somethings, and I think some diagnostic efforts are warranted. (I guess the Chris faction is in support based on a sample of 2) Thank you dear Chris Of The Pacific ‚Ä¶ Now we wait for the other five or six Chris‚Äôs to complete the sample size ‚Ä¶ üòÇ I think this piece is great, and fits totally with NC. It covers geopolitics, economics and the attention economy/firehose of social media. It also goes it together in a very important way ‚Äì the Ellisons, the Hobbit-botherers, real misinformation, and the surveillance state. This is a hugely important and new confluence of power and I for one think it‚Äôs something we should be focusing on. As Chris says above, Yellow Waders stuff :) I am reminded of what the great western sheriff and journalist Bat Masterson said, ‚Äù Everybody gets plenty of ice. The difference is that the Rich get it in the summertime, and the Poor get it in the winter.‚Äù This was, among other things, a description post on a part of the influencer world. Go back and do a scroll watching all those selfies, most of them trying to look happy and sure, and a few serious and sure. Truth in a selfie is what the influencers sell. It is precisely each of those selfies, secure, happy, full-screen faces the main and only source for trust in each influencer and whatever they say. IMO, this show is, by itself, interesting. Then go and check cui bono in the same post. I really have no idea on how influencing are these influencers but this is a relatively new and weird way to push and invest on whatever campaign. For me, this is the very first example of a ‚Äúgeostrategic influencer campaign‚Äù. The dots are getting closer, not much skill needed to connect them anymore. Ellison and the rest of the Zio-garchy fidn to be trillionaires soon, as all the wealth and resources are asset-stripped and sucked up by the Giant Vampire Squid. (to bring back the metaphor). As the electromagnetic spectrum is increasingly monopolized, the more they can completely dictate most public discourse. And the cycle continues‚Ä¶. but on the bright side, it seems like more and more are starting to question, as the lies get more and more irrational and transparent. (I‚Äôm trying to be optimistic for a change) Thanks to places like NC, we can read and discuss matters that are outside of the Unified Hegemonic Narrative, which is becoming more and more difficult. George Galloway was detained and harassed by armed police at Gatwick Airport recently. His personal electronic devices were seized and he was interrogated for hours. And dude was an MP for decades, and is now a media personality as well. BTW, Alastair Crooke is spelled with an ‚Äúe‚Äù at the end. Long LIve Naked Capitalism! Thanks very much, and I fixed the spelling of Crooke, d‚Äôoh! Silver Lake + the Saudis + Jared Kushner announced today that they are buying Electronic Arts, the world‚Äôs largest (not connected to a platform) video game publisher. Ah I was tempted to fit that in. That‚Äôs a deal that really makes explicit the alliance between the Zionist money and the Gulf State Arabs. Abraham Accords may be dead but long live the Abraham Accords, amirite? W.T.A.F. There‚Äôs been a recent groundswell about banning Israel from international sports ‚Ä¶ I am wondering how this plays into it. They are determined to have some method of tapping into youth to keep spreading #N1Oni5T propaganda and lies ‚Ä¶ Ugh I do fear that this will culminate in a real wide spread antisemitism as I think theres plenty to show that there for many, there is little distinction between a Zionist and a Jew (buffered by how Israel wraps itself in the Jewish idenity) What‚Äôs worse, these psychos are more than happy with it because it then supports their position that the only safe place for Jewish people is Israel. This is becoming far more grim than I could have ever imagined. Last time you posted ‚ÄúDoomscrolling ‚Ä¶ ‚Äú, I promised to return to comment in depth, but never did ‚Ä¶ #Boo But today ‚Ä¶ I avenge my master! LOL (via screenrant.com) #NarrativeControl I always fondly recall how MSM heads exploded after Bernie won Nevada in 2020 Dem Primary. That was a good example of what happens when establishment consent manufacturing doesn‚Äôt work. The stakes are much higher here, however, hence the incredibly desperate moves. But you can tell it‚Äôs a bunch old old heads (Boooooooomeeeeerrrs) running the show. What makes them think that the kids making tik-toks about #th3G4z@g3N0c1d3 won‚Äôt move elsewhere to some other platform if there is some kind of clamp down? Remember all the Americans who rushed to RedNote earlier this year (via Reuters)? What would the US do to stop that? The only forcing function for obedience is the fact that a lot of creators make good $ on TikTok. Not sure how many of those posting radical dissent need to stay on that gravy train. ‚Ä¶ which is a perfect segue to Influencer Dipshittery. #InfluencerDipshittery > ‚Ä¶ influencers are also often ignorant of politics and sometimes utterly amoral and therefore happy to sign up to support genocide Pretty much. Thanks for the tweets. They often serve as portals, not ends in and of themselves. One need only follow them via the comments and replies to realize again that this is not a one way street. Those hoping to keep g3n0C16e alive are seriously underestimating the severity of the schisms on both sides of the political divide, and the degree of clapback incoming. I was curious to follow up on one Destiny Albritton ‚Äì it‚Äôs always somewhat bizarre to see African American or other people in the African diaspora caping for Ni0n15ts. What on earth are they thinking? Her last repost is of another African American influencer, Xaviaer DuRousseau, posting a seven-point-litany of excuses talking points regarding the now confirmed and infamous Hamptons influencer gathering hosted by Bill Ackman. One can almost feel the beads of perspiration on this brother‚Äôs forehead ‚Ä¶ LOL ‚Ä¢ He repeats the talking point Netenyahu tried to sell the world in the first tweet after the shooting ‚Äì that Charlie was a friend of Israel. That‚Äôs not untrue, but why is everyone keen to say it if it were not in question? ‚Ä¢ He tries to explain away being nervy when approached by Max Blumenthal ‚Äì I was drunk. I never heard of you or your site. See Nat‚Äôs quote above re: ignorant. ‚Ä¢ He claims Charlie designed the event, and one of the topics covered was right-wing infighting ‚Ä¶ funny that. When I followed the rabbit hole to DuRousseau‚Äôs X profile, I saw plenty evidence of that: beefing with Tim Pool? Check! Getting called out by mostly right-wing accounts for shilling for Bibi? Check! So you see, their dipshittery is getting a fair amount of blowback, and that‚Äôs the main thing I take away: that we‚Äôre seeing a schism in real time, and I don‚Äôt think that genie is getting shoved back in the bottle. And buying TikTok or hiring a bunch of amoral influencers to sh**post Bibi‚Äôs way out of his murderous overreach is not going to work. #HollywoodHasbara I‚Äôve always felt that there was a certain fearlessness or perhaps, audacity is a better term, when it comes to Hollywood feeling free to push establishment and anti-establishment narratives. October 7th documentaries are all well and good, but remember, you‚Äôre dealing with a generation that‚Äôs been fed movies like the entire Bourne series, in which the US Spook estate is the villain. See also one of my favorite rogue agent movies, ‚ÄúShooter‚Äù (via IMDb), which stars Marky Mark Wahlberg as a putative assassination patsy who refuses to die and goes on to turn an FBI agent into his kill-em-all-let-deity-decide ally, and basically kills everyone in the sick deep state chain of command who conspired to end his life. Can‚Äôt lie, that movie was the first thing on my mind when the whole Tyler Robinson narrative began to unfold. And I‚Äôm sure other people who have feasted on the exploits of Jason Bourne and Bob Lee Swagger felt the same ‚Äì even about Trump‚Äôs would be rally assassin in PA. I don‚Äôt know how the architects of this plan expect things to turn out. Hollywood isn‚Äôt the only show in town. I can‚Äôt wait for rebel film makers to start getting financing from China ‚Ä¶ LOL I can only assume that we‚Äôre headed to a point where the US is also going to have a ‚ÄúGreat Firewall‚Äù, blocking content from the non-US-based platforms to which USians will flock when they abandon PalantirTok en masse. Get your VPNs ready! #MediaTechAISurveillanceAlliance So to echo dear Ben‚Äôs (jinx!) comment below, how does #OraParaPalantirTok think it‚Äôs going to put the genie back in the bottle? Are we on our way to people being arrested for posting pics of unalived Gazan families? Surveillance for the purpose of what exactly? Kicking kids out of college? More deportations? I agree with Ben here as well: too many people have seen outside their silo. And a lot of those people don‚Äôt necessarily inhabit the same political circles. I have had cause to visit Candace Owen‚Äôs YT tube page more times in the last month then for the entirety of my existence before Kirk‚Äôs death. And it‚Äôs not just what she‚Äôs saying, I also look at what the comments under her videos are saying. and some of those comments are eye-opening. Her last video was posted five hours ago (as of 1030PM US EDT), and has over 1.2M views already. People are questioning everything: ‚Ä¢ Why no autopsy? ‚Ä¢ Why is his wife acting as if nothing‚Äôs happened? ‚Ä¢ His weird security detail ‚Ä¶ their actions before and after In short, the stench is too strong ‚Ä¶ anyone who thinks 10/7 documentaries are gonna guilt people into letting go of pro-Palestinian sentiments this deep into this horrible Netanyahu campaign against Gaza, is as Nat asserts delusional. And what does it mean that we‚Äôve reached the delusion phase of oligarchy? To borrow a phrase from Lambert, the deluded are very much akin to those who were clueless in Versailles. Thanks again, Nat, for this awesome post and the legwork it took to bring it to us. You can‚Äôt unsee dead kids. I think it‚Äôs that simple. If only it were that simple for some ‚Ä¶ (via YouTube) ChrisRUEcon: Thanks for the series of observations, which together are a diagnosis. And there is this that you wrote in regard to influencer (whoever they are ???) dipshittery: ‚ÄúThanks for the tweets. They often serve as portals, not ends in and of themselves. One need only follow them via the comments and replies to realize again that this is not a one way street.‚Äù Yep. I don‚Äôt comment at YTube ‚Äî the comments are a swamp. But they are a way of taking the temperature of USanians. I‚Äôd say that the U.S. two-party system is a flaking fa√ßade, papered with money, trying to keep the splits under its control. The Democrats are split beyond repair, with the Dem liberals desperately trying to control the Dem levellers, and the Republicans are split along MAGA paleoconservative, MAGA authoritarian, Calvinist cargo cult, and a group that advocates a kind of levelling. Equality in the U S of A is going to require levelling. Charlie Kirk was not up to the job, nor is Pete Buttigieg. The problem with portals into US-dominated comments sections at places like YTube is that you have many people who think expressing an opinion, of any kind, is some sort of political act. See FcBook and its swamp of memes. An opinion is an opinion is an opinion. The U.S. political arena (or ‚Äúmarketplace of ideas‚Äù to use a typical Anglosphere clich√©) hasn‚Äôt approached dialectic. What is to be done? > What is to be done? Deft touch, sir ‚Ä¶ :) (via marxists.org) Oh to be in Chocolate City and not potentially be labeled a terrorist ‚Ä¶ LOL > the comments are a swamp. But they are a way of taking the temperature of USanians Precisely. In analyzing the various splits, I am reminded of the chemical definition of a catalyst ‚Äì a substance that can speed up a reaction without participating in the reaction. If I were to try and pull some rusty knowledge out from high school memories ‚Ä¶ ahhh Vanadium Oxide somewhere in my text book ‚Ä¶ I would suggest Kirk‚Äôs murder is catalyst that has managed to create a (likely fleeting, but nevertheless potent) separation of the shared element that exists in both the left and right ‚Äúpolitical molecules‚Äù. Let us call that element AmDoPoSCoFi-UM ‚Ä¶ LOL ‚ÄúAmerican Domestic Policy Should Come First‚Äù Think of all the Culture War ingredients as impurities that prevent the pure Amdoposcofium from shining forth in all its glory! And yet now ‚Ä¶ faced with the prospect (nee reality) that ‚Äúthe reason we cannot have nice things here‚Äù is because ‚Äúour government is controlled by the inhumane, violent, sociopathic government of another country‚Äù, the impurities are being stripped away in real time. In one sense, you can assess this by what is absent from the comments. What types of comments do you typically see after a shooting? ‚Ä¢ 2A arguments ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúNot the right time to politicize ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù ‚Ä¢ But but ‚Äúgang bangers in Chicago‚Äù Far less so this time ‚Ä¶ Hasbara not working? Even with TikTok, I‚Äôm not sure this genie goes back in the bottle. Too many people have seen outside their silo. Americans‚Äô Support for Israel Dramatically Declines, Times/Siena Poll Finds (NYT article) Raw data (NYT) In the aftermath of the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, American voters broadly sympathized with Israelis over Palestinians, with 47 percent siding with Israel and 20 percent with Palestinians. In the new poll, 34 percent said they sided with Israel and 35 percent with Palestinians. Thirty-one percent said they were unsure or backed both equally. A majority of American voters now oppose sending additional economic and military aid to Israel, a stunning reversal in public opinion since the Oct. 7 attacks. About six out of 10 voters said that Israel should end its military campaign, even if the remaining Israeli hostages were not released or Hamas was not eliminated. And 40 percent of voters said Israel was intentionally killing civilians in Gaza, nearly double the number of voters who agreed with that statement in the 2023 poll. Younger voters, regardless of party, were less likely to back continuing that support. Nearly seven in 10 voters under 30 said they opposed additional economic or military aid. Much of the shift in views on Israel has been driven by a sharp decline in support by Democratic voters. Republicans largely continue to support Israel, though there has been a modest decline‚Ä¶. ‚Ä¶Yet even Republican support has fallen, albeit by significantly less. Republicans still sympathize with Israel more than Palestinians, 64 percent to 9 percent. But those numbers indicate a drop in support of 12 percentage points since 2023, when 76 percent sided with Israel. About a third of Republicans said Israel‚Äôs military was not taking enough action to prevent civilian deaths. > I‚Äôm not sure this genie goes back in the bottle Ha! Jinx! And I‚Äôm not even a Chris :) Fantastic work Nat! And it helps to have the links to your earlier pieces plus the additional on-line stuff for review as you piece together this grotesque crazy quilt. Historically it‚Äôs probably always been something like this but it is really something being able to see so many uber wealthy coming up from the depths to strut their stuff and make their moves. Yes, agreed. Nate is doing Lambert level work and is much appreciated. Larry Ellison has the proverbial face that needs punching. speaking of ‚Äúthe proverbial face that needs punching‚Äù, once upon a time in a prior life, i worked in the same redwood shores tower that that slimy now-billionaire had his offices. dreaded taking the lifts due to the chance of meeting him therein. legends said he fired people for being in the lift with him. being h1b, the risk was great. that entire corpse was made in his image, btw ‚Ä¶ Great post, Nat. I am really enjoying your contributions to NC! Regarding your final point: I think this theory is mostly accurate. I think Israel may be the only country that offers a path to citizenship purely through religious affiliation, and (at least until the Kahanists/State of Judea types solidify their grip on long term power) it doesn‚Äôt actually require real religious dogma if the halacha rule of a Jewish mother and the associated birth and congregation records are available. Combined with several other aspects (Israel‚Äôs extradition policy, the extremely dense startup/financier community, the extreme overlap between civilian/military/intelligence communities due to mass conscription) it would not surprise me to find out there is not just one ‚Äòbig group‚Äô but many groups that leverage their relationships to the state and the supra- and trans-national state organizations to profit in various ways. Regarding Ellison explicitly this tidbit may be of interest in terms of ‚Äòwhy TikTok, why now‚Äô: A close friend of former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Ellison has been named as a potential witness in the trial against the Likud leader as part of Case 2000, the alleged bribery affair involving Yediot Ahronot. Netanyahu and his family recently vacationed on Ellison‚Äôs Hawaiian island, Lania, which he purchased in 2012 for some $300 million. Among his contributions to Israeli causes are more than $26 million given to Friends of the Israel Defense Forces, as well as $500,000 to fortify a community center in Sderot in 2007. From this hagiographic fluff piece from 2021. <"Netanyahu and his family recently vacationed on Ellison‚Äôs Hawaiian island, Lania" Or LƒÅna ªi as we call it here, though commonly written Lanai as, let's face it, using diacritics isn't a USian thing. But other than refurbing the two resorts on the island, can't see that Ellison has had any impact whatsoever here. Or if he has it doesn't get any reporting. Living in Greece but was back in Northern California for a wedding this summer. Lived there till 2021. Just anecdata but an acquaintance, staunch right wing Trump supporter, very Christian was appalled at what was happening in Gaza. I remember him being a Ben Shapiro stan back in the day also. When you‚Äôve lost someone like him then I think the percentages of Israel support among the republicans, esp the America first crowd, may be even lower than the polls capture. To add, back in 2021 the area (Yuba City/Marysville and surrounding countryside) was chock fulla Trump signs and American flags. I didn‚Äôt see one sign this time around. Think the rural population feels duped, esp as cheap farm labor gets rounded up. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email * SUBSCRIPTIONS

Title: A look at today's billionaires a century after Rockefeller became the first

Time Published: 2025-09-29T16:44:40Z

Watch CBS News Updated on: September 29, 2025 / 12:44 PM EDT / CBS News On Sept. 29, 1916, it was front page news that a surge in Standard Oil's stock price likely made oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller America's first billionaire. More than a century later, the United States is home to hundreds of billionaires whose fortunes increasingly come from technology and financial markets. Together, they control a growing share of the country's wealth ‚Äî approaching the percentage held by Gilded Age industrialists who built monopolies in railroads, oil and steel. Here's what research tells us about America's billionaire class today. There are a few different estimates of the number of American billionaires, but researchers tend to agree that the billionaire class exceeds 900 and is growing. Forbes, which has produced a list of billionaires since the 1980s, counted roughly 900 in early 2025 ‚Äî up from 813 in 2024. Meanwhile, the wealth-data firm Altrata pinned the number of U.S. billionaires at 1,135 in 2024, an uptick from 1,050 in 2023 and up more than 80% from levels in 2016, when they began releasing yearly reports. And JP Morgan Chase Private Bank estimated the number at roughly 1,990 in 2024 ‚Äî about 15% more than its 2023 estimate. Part of the reason estimates vary is that the ultra-wealthy are not required or incentivized to disclose their net worth. The SEC requires investors to report ownership of more than 5% of a company's shares, but valuations fluctuate with the market, complicating wealth estimates. Adjusted for inflation, the number of billionaires with a Rockefeller-sized fortune is a much smaller set. His $1 billion in 1916 would be worth roughly $30 billion today. By that measure, only about 30 American billionaires have a similar fortune, according to Forbes and Bloomberg. Among them are Oracle founder Larry Ellison and Tesla founder Elon Musk, with net worths above $300 billion. Other tech titans also top the list, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ‚Äî both with fortunes of over $200 billion each, as of Sept. 29. Christopher Nichols, a professor of history at Ohio State University said, "The billionaires of the Gilded Age and the multimillionaires were involved in what we think of as blue chip industries, where there are lots of jobs and stuff produced. The billionaires of today's world are mostly working in tech sectors and places that very often don't employ many people." Together, America's billionaires had an approximate total net worth of $6.8 trillion in the spring of 2025, Forbes estimates, which is a jump of more than a trillion compared to last year after a strong year of growth for U.S. stocks in 2024. In the 20th century, Scottish journalist B.C. Forbes, who founded the eponymous magazine, wrote that if Rockefeller's wealth "could be turned into cash and distributed equally‚Äîwhich it couldn't‚Äî[it] would give every man, woman and child in the United States $10 each." Today, if that estimated $6.8 trillion held by U.S. billionaires could be turned into cash and divided equally among roughly 340 million Americans, it would amount to about $20,000 per person. Another way to think about that sum is that it could theoretically be used to buy every NFL team, pay off Americans' student loan and medical debt and purchase 9 million homes at the current median sales price, with hundreds of billions left over. Data from the World Inequality Database shows that the share of wealth held by the top 1% and the ultra-rich top 0.001% has been rising for decades ‚Äî toward the record levels observed in the Gilded Age. The share of the national wealth held by the top 1% peaked at nearly 50% in 1929 before tumbling during the Great Depression, according to the data. "What happened with the Great Depression was that large fortunes were lost in the stock market. And then the New Deal rebuilt the economy around workers and around small businesses," said Jeremi Suri, a professor of history and public affairs at University of Texas. But in the early 1980s, the top 1% began regaining ground, as union jobs declined and traditional industries like manufacturing shrunk, according to Suri. By 2023 the top 1%, or those with over $4.6 million in assets, controlled more than a third of the nation's wealth ‚Äî up over 10 percentage points from 1980. Data collected by the same researchers shows that the trendline looks similar for those in the top 0.001% of people in the country ‚Äî or those who owned more than $1.5 billion in 2023. The hundreds of billionaires in this category owned about 1% of the nation's net wealth in 1980 and 5% in 2023. Demographically, the billionaire class still resembles J.D. Rockefeller in many ways. The vast majority of the world's billionaires are men ‚Äî about 86.5% in 2025, according to Forbes ‚Äî and most make rather than inherit their wealth. Rockefeller himself was the son of a traveling salesman and a housewife. While his family helped him launch his career, Rockefeller built the majority of his fortune on his own, according to Nichols, an editor of "A Companion to the Gilded Age and Progressive Era." "He came from enough middle class wealth that he could get a loan from his dad to start that business, which so often is the story for business folks," Nichols said. "But he made his billions through his business acumen and hard work, and then also his ruthless competitiveness in an under-regulated time." Research suggests inheritance plays a significant role for many wealthy people today. Roughly 30% of the world's billionaires have inherited their fortunes, according to a 2024 report by UBS, a wealth management company in Sweden. And the share in the U.S. is about a third, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Altrata data. Some of America's wealthiest heirs include Walmart's Alice, Rob and Jim Walton, and Jacqueline Mars, who owns roughly one third of the candy giant Mars founded by her grandfather. Rockefeller and his son gave away a significant amount of their money to charity but it continues to live on. And descendants of the family share a fortune valued around $10.3 billion in 2024.

Vaccination is one of the most effective public health interventions, but its hesitancy still poses a challenge in achieving acceptable coverage. This study was designed to assess the level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and identify its influencing factors among healthcare workers in a teaching hospital in Ghana. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square test of independence, and multiple logistic regression were assessed from the data collected using Stata version 14 software. A response rate of 78.55% (n = 216/275) was recorded. The majority of the participants were females (n = 135, 62.50%), aged between 20‚Äì39 years (n = 204, 94.44%), and were nurses/ midwives (n = 140, 64.81%) followed by medical doctors (n = 43, 19.91%). COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was 19.91% and the commonly cited reasons for this were apathy (n = 8/43, 18.60%) followed by the belief of not being at risk of infection with the virus (n = 7/43, 16.28%). Hesitancy was reduced by participant‚Äôs knowledge of the vaccine effectiveness (aOR= 0.01; CI 95%: 0.001‚Äì0.0996; p < 0.001), COVID-19 training (aOR= 0.34; CI 95%: 0.13‚Äì0.85; p = 0.022), having a past vaccination history (aOR= 0.18, CI 95%: 0.07‚Äì0.45; p < 0.001), and increased by those with the view that vaccine intake should be voluntary (aOR= 3.28; CI 95%: 1.08‚Äì10.01; p = 0.037). COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was recorded among healthcare workers in this teaching hospital with apathy and belief of no risk to being infected by the virus as commonly cited reasons for this. This is a concern as healthcare workers are expected to be well-informed of the benefits and risks of vaccination. Continuous education on vaccine safety and efficacy can improve vaccine uptake among this population.

COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus disease that was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2020 [1]. Since then, the disease has had a significant impact on lives and economies worldwide [2‚Äì4]. The outbreak originated as pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China [5]. Ghana recorded its first two cases of COVID-19 on March 12, 2020, and as at June 23, 2024, there had been a total of 775 million cases and 7 million deaths worldwide, with 172,045 cases and 1,462 deaths in Ghana [3,6]. Initial national responses included case identification, contact tracing, quarantine and isolation of infected persons, social distancing, and the widespread use of face masks and hand sanitizers [7]. Vaccination is one of the most effective interventions for combating the spread of infectious diseases in the general population [8,9]. According to the WHO, at least 70% vaccination coverage is needed to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the causative organism for COVID-19 [10], although higher thresholds have been proposed to address more transmissible variants such as Delta and Omicron [10‚Äì12]. Despite this evidence, vaccination campaigns worldwide have been constrained by vaccine hesitancy [13‚Äì15]. Vaccine hesitancy is defined by the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) as the delay in accepting or refusing vaccination despite the availability of vaccination services [16]. It is acknowledged to be complex, context-specific, and dynamic, shaped by factors of complacency, convenience, and confidence [17,18]. Within Ghana, studies exploring COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers have reported divergent findings. For example, Agyekum et al. (2021) documented a hesitancy prevalence of 60.7% among healthcare workers in Accra, a strikingly high figure at the time of early vaccine rollout [19]. Similar rates of such hesitancy have been observed among this group in Ghana and other sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries [20‚Äì24]. These further highlight the role of vaccine efficacy and safety, availability and accessibility, vaccination history, occupational status, societal and peer influence and conspiracy theories in shaping vaccine attitudes among health professionals in Ghana [19,23‚Äì27]. These discrepancies reflect differences in study timing, geographical location, cadre of health workers sampled, and the evolving information environment. Several studies have been conducted globally to assess COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among the general population in most countries [28‚Äì32]. Given that healthcare workers are at increased occupational risk and serve as trusted sources of health information for the wider population, understanding the factors underlying their vaccination decisions remains a critical public health priority. However, while several studies have assessed vaccine hesitancy among the general population in Ghana, relatively fewer have focused specifically on healthcare workers and particularly those in teaching hospitals [19,22‚Äì24,27,33]. The present study therefore seeks to assess the prevalence and determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among frontline clinical staff at Ho Teaching Hospital in the Volta Region of Ghana, thereby contributing to the limited but growing body of Ghanaian evidence on this subject. The study was conducted in Ho Teaching Hospital (HTH), a 354-bed capacity tertiary health facility located in the Volta Regional capital, Ho in Ghana [34]. It has about 1200 clinical and non-clinical staff. The clinical departments in the hospital are Surgery, Internal Medicine, Paediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Pharmacy, Laboratory and Radiology. The hospital is patronized by walk-ins and referred clients from the region and clients from neighbouring countries including the Republic of Togo, Benin, and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. It provides general and specialised services to about 7000 outpatients and 3000 in-patients every year [35]. The study focused on front-line clinical healthcare workers as they are more likely to come into contact with COVID-19 patients. The targeted study participants included medical doctors, nurses, midwives, pharmacists, and laboratory personnel. The breakdown of the target group is as follows: 24 pharmacists, 94 doctors, 110 laboratory personnel, and 862 nurses and midwives. The Raosoft online sample size calculator was used to estimate the sample size. Based on a margin of error of 5%, confidence level of 95%, population size of 1090, and a hesitancy response of 60.7%, which was based on a similar previous study [19], the calculated sample size was 275. The various targeted healthcare workers were recruited based on their calculated population proportional to their size; leading to the recruitment of 24 medical doctors, 6 pharmacists, 217 nurses and midwives and 28 laboratory personnel. The questionnaires were then distributed to them to respond to after they had consented to participate in the study. The data for this study were collected with a structured self-administered questionnaire (supplementary file) that was administered both via Google online form and paper-based questionnaire. Data were collected between 1st June 2023 and 30th August 2023. The questionnaire was adapted from previous similar studies [19,20,23]. It had three sections which consisted of sociodemographic factors including age, sex, religion, marital status, education level and occupation; participants‚Äô job details including type of occupation, years of practice, and role at the COVID-19 treatment at the facility; clinical characteristics and vaccine history including medical history, COVID-19 vaccine type, number of doses and vaccine acceptance/ refusal, participants‚Äô knowledge, and perception concerning the COVID-19 vaccine, and reasons for refusal and acceptance of vaccine. The outcome variable was vaccine hesitancy, and this was defined as one‚Äôs refusal to take the vaccine in spite of its availability [16]. The data obtained from the online Google forms and hardcopy questionnaires were entered into a Microsoft Excel version 2016 sheet. The data were then cleaned and imported to Stata version 14 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) for analysis. Descriptive statistics in the form of percentages of variables, and then Chi-square test of independence were performed to assess the association between these variables and the outcome variable (status of vaccine hesitancy). Multiple logistic regression was then conducted for the variables that showed statistical significance with a p-value less than 0.05 to assess for the predictors of vaccine hesitancy. Ethical clearance was sought from the Ethics Committees of both the University of Health and Allied Science (UHAS-REC A.7 [46] 22‚Äì23) and Ho Teaching Hospital (HTH-REC (36) FC_2022). Written informed consents were sought from both online and in-person participants before the commencement of the study. Information on the participant information leaflet which included study details, and the benefits and risks of participating were given to each participant. Data collected were anonymized to safeguard confidentiality and kept secured with the principal investigator. A total of 216 healthcare workers responded to the survey giving a 78.55% response rate. Majority were females (n = 135, 62.50%) and aged between 20‚Äì39 years (n = 204, 94.44%), were Christians (n = 212, 98.15%) and had never been married (n = 147, 68.06%). (Table 1). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0333412.t001 Nurses and midwives (n = 140, 64.81%) were the most common occupation, followed by medical doctors (n = 43, 19.91%), and undergraduate/diploma qualification n = 184, 85.19%) was commonest highest educational level. Majority of them had been practicing for less than 10 years (n = 199, 92.13%). Majority had been previously vaccinated (n = 199, 92.13%). Most of them had no chronic diseases (n = 206, 95.37%) and had not been diagnosed with COVID-19 since the inception of the pandemic (n = 173, 80.09%). The majority of the respondents did not have a family member who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 (n = 184, 85.58%). Most of the healthcare workers had come into contact with a patient diagnosed with COVID-19 (n = 152, 70.37%). Most of them had received training on COVID-19 via a lecture mode (n = 132, 61.11%) (Table 1). Of the 216 participants, few of them had refused accepting the COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., hesitant) (n = 43, 19.91%). Most commonly cited reasons for vaccine hesitancy were apathy towards taking the vaccine (n = 8/43, 18.60%), followed by belief of not being at risk of infection with the virus (n = 7/43, 16.28%). 63 out of the 173 participants who delayed in taking the vaccine cited reasons of uncertainty about the long-term adverse effect of vaccine (n = 28/63, 44.44%), and poor accessibility to vaccine (n = 6/63, 9.52%). The most (n = 72/173, 41.62%) commonly cited reason for taking the COVID-19 vaccine was the perceived risk of infection from COVID-19 (41.62%) followed by workplace requirement (n = 34/173, 19.65). The commonest brand of vaccine received by most participants was ChAdOx-1s (n = 92/173, 19.08%), followed by Ad26.COV2-S (n = 33/173, 19.08%). The majority of the participants (149/173, 86.13%) who accepted vaccination received the full dose of the vaccine, and most of them (n = 111/173, 64.16%) did not receive booster doses. (Table 2) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0333412.t002 Most (n = 130/216, 60.19%) responded that COVID-19 vaccines should be voluntary for healthcare workers. Furthermore, most (n = 160/216, 74.07%) of them responded that vaccination is an effective way to prevent and control COVID-19 and that they (n = 185/216, 85.65%) would advise their friends and family to take the COVID-19 vaccine. Most of them responded that their views on the COVID-19 vaccine had not changed over time (n = 139/216, 64.35%). (Table 2) Vaccine hesitancy was associated with gender status (p = 0.031), being a member of the COVID care team (p = 0.019), having received any other vaccination apart from childhood vaccines (p < 0.001), having attended COVID-19 lecture (p = 0.011), view of the vaccine requirement for health workers (p < 0.001), knowledge of the vaccine being an effective way to prevent and control COVID-19 (p < 0.001) and whether the person would recommend the COVID-19 vaccine to friends and family (p < 0.001) (Table 3). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0333412.t003 Vaccine hesitancy was predicted by participant‚Äôs knowledge of the vaccine being an effective means of preventing and controlling the disease (aOR= 0.01; CI 95%: 0.01‚Äì0.00; p < 0.001), COVID-19 training via lecture method (aOR= 0.34; CI 95%: 0.13‚Äì0.85; p = 0.022), their view on vaccine requirement for health workers (aOR= 3.28; CI 95%: 1.08‚Äì10.01; p = 0.037). past vaccination history (aOR= 0.18, CI 95%: 0.07‚Äì0.45; p < 0.001). (Table 4) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0333412.t004 This study found a COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy prevalence of 19.91% among frontline clinical healthcare workers at Ho Teaching Hospital. When situated within the broader Ghanaian literature, this prevalence is relatively low. For instance, Agyekum et al. (2021) reported a much higher hesitancy rate of 60.7% among healthcare workers in Accra at the onset of the vaccine rollout [19]. Similarly, Lamptey et al. (2022) and Botwe et al. (2022) documented high levels of uncertainty and refusal in other Ghanaian cohorts [22,27]. In contrast, our findings align more closely with those of Alhassan et al. (2021) in Northern Ghana, who reported that a majority of healthcare workers were willing to accept vaccination, particularly when vaccines were accessible and clear communication was provided [23]. The lower hesitancy we observed may reflect the timing of our study, which was conducted when vaccines were more widely available, when healthcare workers had greater exposure to training and public campaigns, and when local experiences with COVID-19 outcomes may have reinforced the perceived importance of vaccination. Vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers is particularly concerning given its benefits in protecting this vulnerable population due to increased exposure and their critical role in influencing public perception and vaccine uptake [14,15,18]. The finding that hesitancy among healthcare workers was not substantially lower than in the general population in this study and others in Ghana highlights a missed opportunity to leverage healthcare workers as vaccination advocates [30,36,37]. Apathy and a self-perceived low risk of infection emerged as the most frequently cited reasons for hesitancy, agreeing with findings from studies in Saudi Arabia and France [30‚Äì32]. This persistent misperception of risk among healthcare workers is concerning, as it may undermine compliance with future vaccination campaigns and weaken broader public health interventions if left unaddressed. This study identified several factors significantly associated with vaccine hesitancy. Female gender, not having received prior adult vaccinations, lack of COVID-19 training, belief that vaccination should be voluntary, and doubts about the vaccine‚Äôs effectiveness were all predictive of hesitancy. Gender has been identified as a predictor of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers [38‚Äì40]. The finding of the influence of gender on vaccine hesitancy is consistent with a previous study indicating that female healthcare workers are more likely to exhibit vaccine hesitancy, often due to fears surrounding infertility or rare side effects, such as thromboembolic events associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine [40,41]. This is particularly relevant in Ghana, where AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1-S) was the most widely administered vaccine during the initial phases of the vaccination campaign [42]. A negative past vaccination history emerged as a strong predictor of hesitancy (aOR = 0.01, p < 0.001), reaffirming findings from other settings that vaccine confidence is often built on positive historical experiences with immunization [43,44]. Similarly, healthcare workers who had undergone COVID-19 training via lecture mode demonstrated reduced hesitancy (aOR = 0.34, p = 0.022), reinforcing the value of structured educational interventions in promoting vaccine acceptance [16‚Äì18]. Another crucial determinant was the belief in the vaccine‚Äôs effectiveness to prevent and control COVID-19, which significantly lowered the likelihood of hesitancy (aOR = 0.08, p < 0.001), as was proposed by the SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy [16]. Notably, healthcare workers who believed that vaccines should be mandatory for healthcare professionals and those who were willing to recommend vaccination to others also showed lower hesitancy, aligning with similar findings in global and African studies [20,43,44]. Despite its valuable contributions, this study has limitations. First, the use of convenience sampling may introduce selection bias and limit the generalizability of findings. Second, the cross-sectional design restricts causal inference, and the use of a single tertiary hospital as the study site may not capture broader national or regional trends. However, the study remains significant as it adds to the limited empirical evidence on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers in Ghana and highlights the need for context-specific strategies to address misinformation, build vaccine confidence, and support institutional trust. Vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers in Ghana, while relatively low, remains a public health concern. The study found that vaccine hesitancy among the study population is primarily driven by apathy, a perceived low risk of infection, and concerns about vaccine safety. Significant predictors of hesitancy included female gender, a lack of prior adult vaccination, absence of formal COVID-19 training, and low confidence in the vaccine‚Äôs effectiveness. Conversely, prior vaccination, training via lectures, belief in the vaccine‚Äôs protective value, and willingness to recommend it to others were associated with lower hesitancy. The predictors of vaccine hesitancy were participants‚Äô knowledge of the vaccine effectiveness, COVID-19 training via lecture method, health workers‚Äô view on whether the vaccine should be voluntary, and the knowledge of the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing and controlling COVID-19. Taken together, these findings contribute to a better understanding of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers in Ghana. They confirm that hesitancy is not static but responsive to evolving conditions such as vaccine availability and training opportunities. They also illustrate that interventions must be context-specific, as strategies that are effective in a tertiary teaching hospital may differ from those needed in rural or primary care settings. From a policy perspective, the relatively low hesitancy observed in this study suggests that structured training programs and institutional support can play a critical role in building vaccine confidence among healthcare workers. Targeted education, particularly addressing gender-specific concerns, should be prioritized. Additionally, leveraging positive vaccination histories and ensuring that healthcare workers themselves are well-informed and supported could enhance their role as advocates for vaccination in the general population. By documenting these determinants, this study not only complements earlier Ghanaian reports but also highlights pathways through which vaccine hesitancy can be effectively reduced among health professionals in similar contexts. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0333412.s001 (DOCX)

September 29, 2025 8:30am by Barry Ritholtz The transcript from this week‚Äôs, MiB: Dmitry Balyasny, Founder/CIO Balyasny Asset Management, is below. You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, and Bloomberg. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ This is Masters in business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio Barry Ritholtz: On the latest Masters in Business Podcast. Strap yourself in another great one. Dmitri bni. He‚Äôs co-founder of the Hedge Fund, Balyasny Asset Management. They‚Äôre a $28 billion multi-Strat firm, 170 portfolio teams. 2300 people working in their offices around the world. He started as a trader at Schoenfeld, grew into both a manager and just a person looking at the world and identifying inefficiencies and coming up with ways to capitalize in it. Fascinating conversation. Not only are they one of the most successful multi-strats, but they have a somewhat unusual business manager. They have lots of partners who are employees, traders, business people, fund managers. Really just, just a fascinating approach to corporate culture, to creating the right set of incentives and and creating a high functioning meritocracy. Very few people have seen the world of hedge funds develop from a trading perspective the way Dmitri has. I thought the conversation was absolutely spectacular and I think you will also. With no further ado, my discussion with Dmitri Balyasny: Dmitry Balyasny: Thanks for having me, Barry. Barry Ritholtz: And we got to say hello to Mike on the way in. We‚Äôll, we‚Äôll talk about that a little later. I‚Äôm fascinated by your background. You immigrated from the Ukraine at age seven. How did that affect your perspective in terms of taking risk and just looking at the world? Dmitry Balyasny: I think it was probably very formative in building a thick skin, right? So back in Kiev we‚Äôre living in communist, Soviet Union. Parents would stand in line to buy jug of milk for a couple hours. I‚Äôd never been in a car until I was in the us. Never taken a flight until we immigrated. So very different life there. A lot of discrimination from a religious perspective, an ethnic perspective being Jewish and gave at the time, and then coming here and didn‚Äôt speak the language. Different type of discrimination from being Russian during the height of the Cold War, although never really thought of ourselves as Russian. So it builds, you know, I think it builds character and builds, you know, perseverance in the thick skin to be able to deal with the difficulties and figure stuff out. Barry Ritholtz: You go to college at Loyola University in Chicago where you study business. What was the career plan? Dmitry Balyasny: I wanted to invest, so I did a lot of sales type jobs in high school because I figured out that was the only way you could get paid because you got commissioned as opposed to salary as a kid. But I wanted to transition from selling stocks as a stockbroker, which I was doing in college to trading and taking risk and, and investing. I wasn‚Äôt sure how I was gonna do that and what format, but I was interested in trading and investing from a young age. Read, you know, market wizards, you know, followed the careers of the top traders at the time, applied to every hedge fund I could find. And I was lucky enough to answer a newspaper out of all things when Schoenfeld Securities ran a newspaper ad in Chicago when they opened up that office and it was the one and only time they actually ran a newspaper ad. So I was lucky that I was following the want ads every week‚Ä¶ Barry Ritholtz: I recall seeing, you know, traders wanted Schoenfeld Securities. That‚Äôs right. They were down on Wall Street back in the mid nineties. So you begin trading for Schoenfeld in the mid 1990s. What was the trading environment like? What were you doing for them on the desk? Dmitry Balyasny: Well, at the time, they were looking for people who didn‚Äôt have a lot of preconceived notions and kind of systems and strategies that they really thought worked because they wanted to start them from scratch and kind of teach them their methodology, which was working well at the time. And that fit me very well because I was making a lot of money for at the time in commissions as a broker. But I was promptly losing at trading because I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing. From a trading standpoint, Barry Ritholtz: You had to support your trading habit with commission sales. Dmitry Balyasny: Yeah, exactly. Exactly, exactly. And so I would give people lots of great advice and then proceed to go do the opposite and, and my own trading. So I needed to go somewhere to learn a method that had more structure and discipline. And so they started you with a very small amount of capital, but, and very tight risk limits in terms of, you know, what you could trade when you could trade how, you know, what size you could trade. And from there, once you showed some proficiency, your risk box would expand, Barry Ritholtz: Meaning more capital, little, little looser rains. That‚Äôs right. On what you could do when that‚Äôs right, how long you could hold things. Dmitry Balyasny: That‚Äôs right. And so I started with, you know, very short time periods, very small risk, didn‚Äôt make any money for the first year, which was difficult because the salary was zero. But after that I started kind of getting the hang of it and making money pretty consistently. Barry Ritholtz: How did you work your way through the various roles at Schoenfeld? ‚Äôcause eventually you end up allocating for their internal funds, right? Dmitry Balyasny: Yeah, so it was a almost completely flat management structure. So at one point there were over a thousand people on the trading side. Wow. And there was a handful of people in senior management and, you know, virtually no people in middle management. It was very, very flat. And so you were basically a trader. You could run a group of traders or you were just managing and not really trading. And so I kind of worked my way up from a pure trading position where after I was successful for three or four years, I went to Steven and asked him if I could start hiring people to trade some of my risk. And he was kind enough to say, sure, if you‚Äôre willing to pay for them, you can hire them. And that was good enough for me. And so I did the same thing. I ran an ad in the paper and I started hiring the initial traders, some of whom are still with us today, 25 years later. Wow. So, and then I would allocate some of my risk to them. And then as that became more successful, I hired more traders, eventually analyst, eventually portfolio managers, and we spun off into a division. And while I was doing that, Steve gave me the opportunity to co-invest in a portfolio of hedge fund managers, external managers that we would allocate to. And that was a great experience. I got to meet a lot of the top hedge fund guys at the time. Barry Ritholtz: So from building a whole division at schoenfeld, what led you to found Bally Os Asset management? Dmitry Balyasny: I was always very entrepreneurial into, so again, it was like a very flat firm. So I always felt like I was building my own business. And our strategy started to divert from the rest of the firm. Like we became more fundamental. We were holding things longer, we needed to meet with company management, so we needed sell side coverage. And so that led to separate office space, separate strategies, different types of PMs and traders that we wanted to hire. And eventually it led to needing to take in external capital because it was a more higher capacity, you know, type of strategy that demanded external capital. And so we gradually moved from, you know, an internal group to a division, to a proprietary funded, you know, hedge fund to a traditional, you know, externally funded hedge fund over a few years. Barry Ritholtz: So we‚Äôll talk a little later about some of the technology that you guys have built internally, but mid nineties had to be an incredible environment for trading, and it seemed like every month it was a whole different set of technology that came down the pike. Tell us about your experiences in the nineties and are there any parallels to what‚Äôs going on today? Dmitry Balyasny: Well, I think the world has moved, you know, tremendously in terms of the trading technologies that, that people are using today. When I think about, at the time that I first started as a broker, that‚Äôs really gonna date me. But we had, you know, one monitor that would be on a little carousel that you would spin around between four different brokers when you needed a quote, right? And when I started trading at Chfa, we had a person whose job it was to be the printer reader. And so you didn‚Äôt get your fills electronically, you would get your fills coming back on a printer, and some poor guy‚Äôs job was to read out your prints, you know, so you would know where you got filled. So, you know, you contrast that with all the AI and data, you know, technology today that, that we and others use for, for trading and investing. And it‚Äôs just, you know, tremendously different world from the overall kind of technologies coming through the pike. The internet, I would say was, you know, a bigger change in terms of going from, you know, very little interaction, I would say with, with technology for most companies at the time. And, and really most individual people to, you know, tremendously kind of jumping in and trying to figure it out. Although I think AI will likely be a larger, you know, more substantive change over time. We‚Äôre coming from a place where everybody‚Äôs already, you know, enmeshed in technology in so many different ways, whether you‚Äôre an individual with your, your phone, your computers, your laptops, or you know, your, your meta glasses, et cetera. Or a company with, you know, zillions of engineers. So I think it‚Äôll be more profound over the long term, but the change feels a little bit less than it did at the time. Barry Ritholtz: I mean, there‚Äôs no doubt the internet was a sea change. Being able to plug into the hive mind was huge. Mobile was pretty big. But it sounds like you‚Äôre saying artificial intelligence has the potential to be even a bigger change agent than Dmitry Balyasny: Yeah, I think so. I think over time, I think in terms of actual usefulness over time and ability to make you better and smarter in lots of different tasks at work, at home, et cetera. I use these apps, you know, every day and they‚Äôre still, you know, very new and rough. So you, but you could see at the rate of improvement, if you project it out and you think about like where these are gonna be in 5, 10, 15 years, like, I think it‚Äôll be, you know, pretty transformative. Barry Ritholtz: One of the things that really separates Bally, the asset management from many other large multi-strat hedge funds are the amount of technology that you develop internally, tools, apps, research databases. Tell a little bit, tell, discuss a little bit about what‚Äôs it like to constantly being on the bleeding edge of technology. Sure. Dmitry Balyasny: So this was a big evolution for us. I would say over the last, you know, 6, 7, 8 years, first 15 plus years, we mostly used external technologies and we had a pretty small internal tech team. And the idea was basically give people all the support that they needed, all the supporting type of tools, but do as much off the shelf as you can. And over time, as we expanded different strategies and added, you know, macro and commodities and quant and these more technologically sophisticated strategies, we really found that we needed to build a lot more things internally. And so now today we have 500 plus people in technology, another a hundred plus people in, in data teams and AI teams. And we build a lot of really outstanding tools that not only support the investing teams, but really enable a lot of the investing functions, whether it‚Äôs trading, research, risk, even operational in some aspects. When we have folks come over from other, other firms, a lot of times they‚Äôre, we, because we don‚Äôt really advertise it that much. A lot of times people are kind of blown away by some of the things that we‚Äôve developed. Barry Ritholtz: So when I think of technology, I think of things, when you say trading, execution, the ability to get best execution, but risk is a big challenge. How do you identify how much risk is within a portfolio? And given that you‚Äôre multi-Strat, how much do the, does the risk cancel each other out? How do you do that analysis? That seems like, yeah, a moving target, it, Dmitry Balyasny: It‚Äôs really important. So first, the overall philosophy, right? Like this is a slugging type of business, right? So if you, if you contrasted with like high frequency trading, which is a hit rate type of business, right? You‚Äôre gonna have 99% of your trades or whatever are gonna be profitable or a tiny loss, right? Right. But small profit, tiny, tiny, tiny, and repeat, repeat, repeat, right? Right. This is more of a slugging type of business. So if we have PMs and we have 170 investing teams at the moment, right? When you hire And so when you hire an investing team, chances are depending on their track record, maybe 75% of ‚Äôem will wind up working out. If they have a lower track record, they‚Äôre coming as like a former analyst making a transition to the pm Maybe it‚Äôll be 50 50. But if you can control the risk, you might lose, you know, 10 million, 20 million, 30 million on somebody who doesn‚Äôt work out kind of life to date in their performance. But the ones that do work out, you‚Äôre increasing their capital, you‚Äôre growing their team, and they‚Äôll hopefully be with you for 10, 20 plus years. And you might make, you know, hundreds and hundreds of millions off of them, right? So how that plays into risk, right? In order to enable the slugging, you have to have very well defined risk boxes within which people will operate to enable them to bet on the things that they‚Äôre really good at betting on, and try to exclude as much of the other stuff as possible. So for every strategy we‚Äôll have, you know, stops, we‚Äôll have vol targets, vol limits, we‚Äôll have stress limits, liquidity limits, et cetera. And you create this box that‚Äôs completely transparent and in partnership with the portfolio manager that you‚Äôre hiring, and customize it and iterate it. And then as their strategy evolves and there‚Äôs new opportunities, you‚Äôre, you know, adding to it, subtracting from it all the time, et cetera. But the idea is to create this, this, you know, platform for them within which they can create like a very steady growing, you know, alpha stream that really plays to their individual strengths. Barry Ritholtz: You know, you mentioned market wizards at the beginning, and I can‚Äôt remember, I read all of them over the years, the first one a couple of times. I don‚Äôt remember which traitor it was, but the thing that stayed with me was it your win-loss record isn‚Äôt what matters. It‚Äôs how much do you lose when you lose relative to how much you‚Äôre gaining when you win? Exactly. And, and you could lose three quarters of the time if you‚Äôre losing a little bit. But the winners are big winners. Yeah. Net net, that‚Äôs a big win. Yeah. Dmitry Balyasny: We find our, it, it, it varies by strategies, but if you think about equities and equities, we find portfolio managers who have hit rates in the fifties with decent slugging could be very, very good, right? If somebody‚Äôs got a hit rate in the upper fifties with decent slugging, like that‚Äôs, you know, that‚Äôs an all star or somebody could be more like 50 50, but they have very good slugging, you know, that that works. It‚Äôs hard to find somebody with, you know, 25% hit rate and enough slugging to kind of overcome that. ‚Äôcause there‚Äôs just, there‚Äôs just too many reps, Barry Ritholtz: Too much churn. Dmitry Balyasny: But in some other strategies, if you have, you know, commodities for example, or a directional macro there, you can have like even a lower hit rate if they‚Äôre very good at sizing, right? Because they have a smaller number of bets at any given time and they‚Äôre trying to find like a few larger, bigger trades. Barry Ritholtz: Pyramid the winners ride the trends all the way out. Really interesting. Yeah. So you start the firm in 2001, really the beginning of a lost decade. We didn‚Äôt get back over prior highs in every asset class pretty much till 2013. What was it like launching right into the teeth of that.com collapse? Dmitry Balyasny: It was a great trading environment actually. So we, we did very well. At the time we were running a lot less capital. We started with $40 million. So, but the, the markets were less efficient. We were predominantly equity long short. There was a lot of dispersion, there was a lot of things that were unwinding from the bubble in both directions. We were able to take advantage of that and really grow the, grow the business. 00:16:53 [Speaker Changed] What was the biggest surprise to you in terms of the direction the business grew and evolved? 00:17:00 [Speaker Changed] I would say in those years, there wasn‚Äôt anything particularly surprising in, you know, 2008 we made people a little bit of money, but we had 50% redemption. So that was a bit surprising. Hmm. And not particularly pleasant. 00:17:17 [Speaker Changed] They people just, clients just panicked. Yeah. And said, I need liquidity. 00:17:20 [Speaker Changed] Well, because they need liquidity because, so we didn‚Äôt, we chose not to gate people, although we had the, the option in our docks, but we, we decided we were liquid and we actually went to cash in Q4 of, of oh eight. 00:17:30 [Speaker Changed] Did, did that cash come flying back in oh nine? 00:17:34 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, it took a few years actually, but eventually, yes, eventually we got some credit for that. But 00:17:38 [Speaker Changed] If, if you‚Äôre positive in oh eight, what was oh eight down 37%, something like that. Yeah, 00:17:42 [Speaker Changed] We‚Äôre like 50 bucks or something. 00:17:43 [Speaker Changed] Oh really? That‚Äôs a win. Anything in the green is a win. That was 00:17:46 [Speaker Changed] A win. So that was surprising, but outside of that, it wasn‚Äôt anything too crazy. 00:17:51 [Speaker Changed] Coming up, we continue our conversation with Dmitri bni discussing what it was like building BNI asset management into a powerhouse. I‚Äôm Barry Riol, you listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. I am Barry Ritholtz. You are listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My extra special guest this week is Dmitri bni. He is the founder of asset management running about $28 billion in various strategies. And currently your title is Chief Investment Officer. How do you balance that role while simultaneously running a firm of 2300 employees? Well, 00:18:42 [Speaker Changed] I think number one, I have great partners and, and great management team, so that helps a lot. We have 20 partners today and a lot of top senior managements across all the departments. Besides that, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a tremendous amount of different difference in the hedge fund business between being a CIO and a CEO. It‚Äôs kind of really commingled type of function because what are you doing as a CEO? Like you‚Äôre trying to figure out where to make money in the hedge fund, right? So that‚Äôs basically how I spend my time is like trying to optimize our investment strategies. And that really includes pretty much everything you need to do from a business standpoint. You know, how do you get the best people? Where do you have edge? How do you build your competitive mode around a strategy? How do you break in and wedge into a new strategy? And then how do you grow it from there again, that it‚Äôs gonna go down to finding the best people and enabling them to execute in that area. How do you support them with the best infrastructure and technology? So you have to work with all the departments to figure out how to, how to do that. So 00:19:49 [Speaker Changed] The, the one thing that continues to surprise me doing these interviews is how many people have said talent acquisition is absolutely the single most important thing. Yeah, they do. It sounds like you‚Äôre in that camp as well. 00:20:02 [Speaker Changed] Definitely. It all start, it all starts with talent, right? And the talent starts with why are they gonna come to you, right? Like, how are you gonna differentiate? And that was always kind of the starting point from 25 years ago. Because even at that time we were competing with firms that were, you know, 25 times our size, right? And so how are you gonna compete? And you‚Äôre not gonna write the largest check for somebody to show up, right? So you really gotta compete on enabling them to be the most successful over time, right? So that‚Äôs, you know, the insights, the collaboration across strategies, the culture that, that you can foster, helping them build their teams, helping them build the resources and infrastructure around them. Coaching, learning from other people‚Äôs mistakes, you know, having a very transparent environment. All these things that each individually might not be that important, but when you add them all up, it really makes the difference over the arc of somebody‚Äôs career. 00:20:57 [Speaker Changed] And, and to put a little flesh on those bones, ballet asne asset management has won numerous awards in terms of best places to work in money management, including taking the top award from pensions and investments, best places to work. How much of this is comp and how much of this is corporate culture beyond just the dollars? 00:21:21 [Speaker Changed] I think comp is always part of it. Like you certainly have to be competitive and you want to run a meritocracy. So the top people that are really driving the performance of the fund on the business side and the investing side should be super well compensated and have partnership opportunities. But besides that, I think the culture can lead to the performance, right? The culture is not just, it‚Äôs a nice place and people are nice to you, like that‚Äôs great, but if you have like a culture that‚Äôs really, you know, driven, but at the same time collaborative, right? And where people are collegial but they also push each other and they‚Äôre also constantly trying to figure out like better ways of doing things right. And wanna succeed themselves and be the best, but also they want the person next to them to succeed and make the firm better, right? Like if you can create that type of culture, like that really is one that high performers are gonna wanna work in and thrive at. 00:22:18 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. Really, really interesting. So, so let‚Äôs talk a little bit about high performance. You operate a multi-strategy platform. When I hear multi-strat, I think fundamental equity, macro commodity slash futures trading arbitrage, systematic quant. Yep. You got it. Am I missing any that, that‚Äôs a nice list. 00:22:40 [Speaker Changed] No, those are, those are the major strategies. They all have lots of sub components. So you know, we have an arbitrage business for example, that will include, you know, converts and credit long, short and merger arbitrage and you know, a dozen different strategies, right? And commodities. We‚Äôll have folks that are trading futures, directionally we‚Äôll have folks that are doing a lot of RV type tradings. We‚Äôll have physical commodities now that we‚Äôre building out. So all these strategies have lots of sub strategies associated with them, but generally that‚Äôs, you know, the right idea and you‚Äôre constantly trying to enable the next set of strategies, right? If you can execute well in the ones that you‚Äôre in this year, you have the option to figure out how to expand them, which might be more dollars in the stuff you‚Äôre doing well, but also what does that give you the right to compete? And that‚Äôs adjacent and we‚Äôre always trying to kind of figure out what is the next thing. 00:23:38 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. Really interesting. There was an article, I‚Äôm trying to remember which publication I saw it in that claimed you hired a trader with a $50 million pay package from a competitor. Is that remotely close to the sort of pay packages and how much does a trader have to generate in profits to qualify for a $50 million package? Sure. 00:24:01 [Speaker Changed] So you have to remember that the size of capital the folks are running these days has grown a lot. And so what publications like to do to get people to read the articles right, is put in large dollars as opposed to, you know, percentages, 00:24:15 [Speaker Changed] Denominator, blindness, they leave out Yeah. The context that it just looks like a big round number. 00:24:21 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. So you have like these headlines all the time. One on how much people get paid to how much somebody made or lost. And you know, if you have something that says, you know, trader X, YZ lost, you know, $50 million, right? And that‚Äôs like, wow, that sounds like a giant number. But you have to remember we‚Äôre managing 28 billion, right? 00:24:37 [Speaker Changed] That‚Äôs a normal draw down in a bad 00:24:39 [Speaker Changed] Week. Yeah. I mean a typical portfolio manager right? Might be managing a couple billion in, in gross market value, right? Right. So, you know, that‚Äôs two point a half percent, which is not good, but it‚Äôs not, you know, 00:24:50 [Speaker Changed] It‚Äôs not a disaster. 00:24:51 [Speaker Changed] No. Like that‚Äôs kind of the fluctuation that that, that you‚Äôre gonna get, right? And so from a hiring standpoint, it‚Äôs the same thing. If you‚Äôre hiring a, a trader with a $50 million pay package, for example, one that pay package is composed of lots of different things. It‚Äôs not all, it‚Äôs not just, you know, here‚Äôs 50 million 00:25:07 [Speaker Changed] Including his b and l for sure. Yeah. 00:25:09 [Speaker Changed] Like that includes, you know, it might include a guarantee for, for the time that the person is out of the market, it might include budget for hiring out their team, right? A lot of these teams are five 10 in some cases 15 people, so that‚Äôs expensive. Right? And it also might include extra upside incentives, which are only paid out if the person delivers a certain amount of p and l. So, you know, they kinda like print one number, but it, but it‚Äôs actually like lots of different components. Usually with that type of number, you‚Äôre budgeting that person to generate p and l of a hundred million plus a year. 00:25:46 [Speaker Changed] That‚Äôs a good investment vestment, 00:25:47 [Speaker Changed] We should have a track record of doing that. And if, and if you‚Äôre right on that, that leads to very healthy returns net to our investor, which, you know, we‚Äôve delivered over time 00:25:56 [Speaker Changed] That that‚Äôs the game. Yeah. You have over 300 analysts and 170 PMs. How many different teams do you, are you guys running 170 PMs? Is that 170 specific strategies? So 00:26:10 [Speaker Changed] It‚Äôs 170 teams. So within the equities business for example, you‚Äôll have like 70 teams, which sounds like a lot, but you have to remember that that‚Äôs split across, you know, three distinct equities businesses that all have like a different front end. And it‚Äôs also split across offices all over the world. And folks are, you know, based in London trading Europe based in Hong Kong or Singapore or Japan, you know, trading Asia. So it‚Äôs still fairly specialized. And each one of those teams will have a mandate where this is the group of stocks that they‚Äôre focused on in the case of equities, or this is the macro strategy in, you know, RV or emerging markets or rates or directional that they‚Äôre focused on in macro or you know, this person focused on, you know, trading gas or trading power and, and commodities. And they‚Äôll build a team of subspecialists analysts around that. 00:27:03 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. Really interesting. So I mentioned earlier you‚Äôve scaled up to $28 billion. Where does the general management strategy and style begin to get altered? Just by the size? At what point does that, we‚Äôve seen a number of farms at a hundred, $200 billion and just the sheer heft becomes challenging. You can‚Äôt generate alpha at that scale, or at least not the same alpha. How large can this get comfortably? 00:27:37 [Speaker Changed] It‚Äôs, it‚Äôs hard to say. I think that‚Äôs a function of how markets develop over time. So if you have more companies, active capital markets, the world is growing, more places to trade in, you know, more credit instruments, more equity instruments, more macro instruments, then there‚Äôs, there‚Äôs kind of more to do. So if I think of the subset of strategies that we trade today, a lot of these things weren‚Äôt significant businesses, you know, 10 years ago or 20 years ago. So a strategy like merger arbitrage has been around a long time. A strategy like index rebalancing really got going the last 10, 15 years, right? You know, power trading in the commodities markets, right? Not a lot of people doing that 20 years ago. So a, a lot of these things go from very small strategies to much larger markets, you know, over time. And that enables you to run more vol there, you know, increasing your capacity. 00:28:33 The way that we go about it is every year and we update it throughout the year. We measure our capacity for, you know, this year and the following. And so we look at bottom up by each team, like how much can they grow at a steady pace? We don‚Äôt want people to grow too fast and we don‚Äôt want people to stay stagnant, right? Like you wanna find a healthy pace of growth as you‚Äôre expanding your coverage, as you‚Äôre getting used to running larger dollar amounts and dealing with those constraints. And we look at the recruiting. So where can we expand? Who is coming in? What does the pipeline kinda look like? You know, we discount that ‚Äôcause not everyone‚Äôs gonna work out, but you add those numbers together and that gives you a sense of what the growth path is likely to be. And over time that‚Äôs averaged about 20, 25% a year, you know, capacity growth. 00:29:23 [Speaker Changed] So you mentioned you‚Äôre looking both internally and externally at recruiting. When you‚Äôre looking internally, how do you identify and nurture talents? How can you tell when, hey, this person started out as a trader or a pm but they really seem to have skills and can manage a larger group? Yeah. That, that seems like a really challenging thing to 00:29:43 [Speaker Changed] Do. We, we spend a lot of time on that and I think that‚Äôs one of the keys to how we‚Äôre gonna grow from here on out. Like recruiting is super important, but being able to develop your talent, I think as you have scale and you have more people to learn from, right? That becomes a bigger and bigger slice of your senior talent pool over time. So when we started off and, and for a long time, the vast majority of RPMs were recruited, you know, externally today, like inequities business, which is the most mature of our strategies, 25% in the US are internally promoted. And I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if that was 50% in a, in a few years, right? Because now you have more senior PMs from up and coming analysts to learn from more programs that they can participate in to work their way up if that‚Äôs the path that they wanna choose. 00:30:40 Which, you know, that wasn‚Äôt available. You didn‚Äôt have the mentorship and the tools. So how do you help people and select, it‚Äôs both quantitative and qualitative. So on the quantitative side, we try to measure as much as we can. So we have data on people‚Äôs recommendations, right? Not just on the ultimate trades, but the data on their recommendations. And you see what is the performance and we track that, right? So you try to disaggregate the performance of the analyst from the PM and see if who‚Äôs driving value and if it‚Äôs a particular analyst who‚Äôs doing great, like we wanna make sure that person is getting more authority, more autonomy, and more leeway over time, right? More growth opportunities. And the best growth opportunity for them might be with the team that they‚Äôre on. They might be become a more senior analyst, they might become a partner on that portfolio, or they might raise their hand at some point and say like, Hey, I want to be a pm. 00:31:38 And we wanna make sure that we facilitate a path to that if we agree that they are talented. And part of that is in partnership with the PM that they‚Äôre working for. You don‚Äôt want the person to just leave and go somewhere else to take that opportunity. You wanna make sure that they replace themselves, they work in partnership with the pm maybe they co-run something for a period of time and then they have the opportunity to do their own thing. So it‚Äôs, it‚Äôs definitely a combination of those. And it‚Äôs the same thing on the business side. Like you‚Äôre always on the lookout for emerging business leaders who can manage others. And we have a, a lot of leadership development that we do and also us utilizing external coaches as well to help with that. 00:32:17 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. That‚Äôs really interesting. External coaches, you mentioned mentorship. How important is mentorship for to the firm and how significant was it in your own professional journey? Well 00:32:29 [Speaker Changed] That‚Äôs where a partnership culture is really important, right? So I think it‚Äôs still fairly unusual in, in hedge funds, especially in our type of fund. And we‚Äôve always wanted to build a true partnership where people own real equity in the business. You know, they buy in with their own money, they participate in all the economics of the business. And we have partners who are coming from the business side running a particular department. We have partners who are managers, heads of strategies on the investment side and we have portfolio managers. And so that dynamically creates like a culture where folks are incentivized to make the firm better, to make someone else better. And they‚Äôre obviously much more willing and excited to be mentors in those situations. And I think when you start with that, and I started with, you know, two of my co-founders, Scott and Taylor, you know, 20 plus years ago in a partnership type structure. And I think that then flows down through the organization. And so now today we have mentors for, you know, interns coming up, right? And you have mentors for, you know, younger associates in different areas of the firm. And then it goes, you know, all the way up and down the firm. 00:33:43 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really 00:33:44 [Speaker Changed] Quite. And so for myself, sorry I didn‚Äôt answer that question. 00:33:46 [Speaker Changed] No, but you did. Yeah. Let‚Äôs hear about your own mentorship. 00:33:49 [Speaker Changed] I mean I certainly learned a lot from Steve Schofield working, working with him at the time, and got really good opportunities there. I think at a young age it was more, you know, certainly work ethic from, from my folks and then it was a lot from sports, right? I did a lot of, you know, basketball and you know, TaeKwonDo and things like that and seeing kinda what was possible. Like I remember as a kid, like watching TaeKwonDo demonstration where our instructor master shim, it was like a very slight Korean guy. It was probably, I don‚Äôt know, 140, 130 pounds. And he punched through a stack of seven cinder blocks punched through and you know, seeing that as a kid, you and I went to like examine the bricks after he did that and like tried to punch it and I was like, wow, that, you know, that hurt. And just seeing that just kind of shows you kind of what‚Äôs possible because every day after practice you would see the guy sit there punching a lead slab, you know? Yeah. For, you know, I don‚Äôt know, 30 minutes. Wow. Right. And it just adds up over time. 00:34:58 [Speaker Changed] Reminds me of the demonstration, this how old I am Bruce Lee did with the one inch punch. Yeah. Do you recall that? 00:35:04 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I was just showing that to my kids the other day. 00:35:06 [Speaker Changed] Ju-just an inch and he‚Äôs also Yeah, 40 something fly, soaking wet, one 40 and Right. It‚Äôs amazing the focus and power that you can create in such a small 00:35:18 [Speaker Changed] That‚Äôs exactly the thing. It‚Äôs, it‚Äôs focus and perseverance. Right? 00:35:22 [Speaker Changed] Really quite, quite fascinating. So let‚Äôs talk a little bit about the current environment. I was kind of fascinated by something you told your team, you guys are trading too much and not investing enough. Explain. 00:35:39 [Speaker Changed] I think one of the keys to enduring success in the money management business is finding a balance between trading and investing, right? And you have to be true to your DNA and obviously the type of firm that that you‚Äôre at, right? But within each type of firm and each type of strategy, there‚Äôs always this, you know, tension, right? Because you can‚Äôt survive in a hedge fund type model, you know, just being a long term investor and you can‚Äôt really scale in a significant growing hedge fund being just a super active trader, right? So you need some combination of the two. And so what we try to do both at the individual level and at the strategy level is help folks find that balance. Part of it‚Äôs just seeing what‚Äôs working and part of it is a lot of statistical analysis that we do on each of the, each of the teams. 00:36:46 So when I made that comment, we were coming out of a period where I noticed that folks are really trading a little bit too much in the fundamental, you know, equities business and we‚Äôre like a little bit overly focused on each data point or we‚Äôre kind of missing the forest from the trees, right? And we were chopping ourselves up a little bit too much, missing some of the bigger winners and creating a lot of trading slippage costs. So we really worked hard with the teams to find more balance with that. Like find some positions that you can really be a longer term investor in. It doesn‚Äôt have to be, you know, years and years, but it could be, you know, months and quarters and supposed to days to weeks and find investments where there‚Äôs multiple ways to win where you‚Äôre not playing for one particular data point, you‚Äôre playing for a whole series of data points that‚Äôs gonna revalue you know, that security over time. And that‚Äôs been, you know, very, very effective I would say. 00:37:46 [Speaker Changed] So how much of this is a function of the environment that we all find ourselves in at any given moment? 22 was a double digit down year for stocks and bonds, but it was followed by 23 and 24 both years back to back plus 25%. Yeah. At least for US equities. Yeah. If, if you‚Äôre shortening up your investing timeline in a plus 25% year, is it just as simple as, hey, you‚Äôre leaving too much money on the table by trading? Well, 00:38:16 [Speaker Changed] For us it‚Äôs a little bit different because we‚Äôre running pretty much market neutral and in almost all the strategies. So if you‚Äôre running market neutral, whether the market‚Äôs up 25 or down 25, like you‚Äôre always gonna have half your portfolio that‚Äôs losing money on a, on an absolute basis. But you‚Äôre trying Yeah, but you‚Äôre trying to make the spread, right? Like you‚Äôre trying to make the the spread between your lungs and, and your shorts, right? So what influences are trading more than the absolute direction of the market is the volatility in the market. So if you‚Äôre in a period that‚Äôs very high vol, you‚Äôre naturally gonna be trading more to manage your risk and also because you‚Äôre getting stopped on things or they‚Äôre hitting your targets like fairly quickly. And high vol is associated with, with fundamental events like changing very quickly 00:39:01 [Speaker Changed] 20, 22, 500 base points 00:39:03 [Speaker Changed] Of fed hikes. Yeah. Or like the spring. So you, you, you, you‚Äôre gonna trade more during those April 00:39:06 [Speaker Changed] Of 00:39:06 [Speaker Changed] 2025 Exactly. Versus periods where things are sort of slowly, you know, trending and that‚Äôs okay, but over the course of the year, right, those periods are gonna balance out. Some will be vol, some will be lower vault. You want to find like the right amount of turnover to where you can capture your alpha, capture those relative mispricings and move on to the next thing that generate a strong sharp combined with like enough capacity, right? You can have a very high sharp and low capacity that doesn‚Äôt really help in a a scale, you know, hedge fund, right? You can‚Äôt eat your sharp, but you need enough sharp to be consistent putting up a p and l that kind of matters for the firm, that matters for the team that you‚Äôre running. And so for every strategy, like we try to come up with like what is a reasonable range, right? And that might be higher for, you know, a tech portfolio manager than, you know, utilities portfolio manager, right? But each of them should have a range that sort of is optimum for their style and we try to help them, you know, find that. 00:40:10 [Speaker Changed] So with the benefit of hindsight, I‚Äôm looking back at 2024, a fairly low vol year, Hey, maybe we should be trading a little less and holding a little longer and then 2025 volume spiked and at the end of Q1 and into Q2, all right, you guys can chop it up a little more. Is it just that simple or 00:40:29 [Speaker Changed] Yes. But again, I would say the more nuanced answer would be there‚Äôs lots of different types of trades that each person does. And you don‚Äôt want any pm doesn‚Äôt want their portfolio to just be one type of trade, right? So you might have short term trades, medium term trades, long term trades, right? Structural trades, tactical trades, risk mitigation, trades, et cetera. There‚Äôs lots of different types of trades and people run into problems when they get too focused on one kind of thing, right? And then when that thing is no longer working, it‚Äôs very hard to then reinvent yourself ‚Äôcause you don‚Äôt have any other, you know, irons in the fire, right? So again, we‚Äôre trying to run a lot of analysis and find like, what is the team really good at? Make sure that‚Äôs being expressed in the portfolio. Make sure there‚Äôs enough balance of different types of trades and that they‚Äôre not betting on things that they don‚Äôt really have views on that can take them out of the game before the things they do have views on payoff. 00:41:31 [Speaker Changed] Coming up, we continue our conversation with Dmitri bni, co-founder of BNI Asset Management, discussing the current market environment for trading. I‚Äôm Barry Ritholtz, you are listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. I am Barry Ritholtz. You are listening to Masters in business on Bloomberg Radio, and some of you are watching this on YouTube. My extra special guest this week is Dmitri bni. He is the co-founder of BNI Asset Management, a multi-strategy hedge fund running over $28 billion. Do the different teams hedge their own positions or is that a function of firm-wide risk management and, and somebody else? 00:42:28 [Speaker Changed] We do both. So each team is responsible for running within their risk parameters. So they‚Äôll have, you know, in the case of of the long short portfolio manager, they‚Äôll have a idio risk, right? How much of your risk is outside of factor risk, right? And that should be, you know, 60, 70, 80% of your risk depending on the portfolio and the, and the style of the pm. But it‚Äôs basically the vast majority of somebody‚Äôs risk is their stock picking alpha, right? And depending on their skill and things like picking the right industry or trading the directionality of the market around, we might give them some more room or less room. You know, to do that, if you‚Äôre a directional macro trader, you‚Äôre gonna have, you‚Äôre not gonna have that constraint because you‚Äôre paid to directionally bet on the market, right? But you‚Äôre gonna have other limits like stress limits, right? 00:43:19 So if your directional bets don‚Äôt work out and there‚Äôs a gap tomorrow, you know, how much are you gonna lose in a stress scenario? So you have to, if that number is too high versus the agreed upon risk limits, you have to do something in your portfolio to hedge, you know, that that risk, right? So it‚Äôs a little bit different for each type of strategy, but the common philosophy is you wanna be able to run it to maximize your return while staying in the game, right? And delivering a relatively steady source of alpha over time. 00:43:53 [Speaker Changed] It, it‚Äôs interesting because they‚Äôre called hedge funds, but many hedge funds don‚Äôt hedge. And it sounds like BNY really makes an effort to make sure that as a risk management approach, anything that‚Äôs potentially downside, as you said, a gap has to be hedged. Yeah, 00:44:12 [Speaker Changed] I mean you‚Äôre looking for ab consistent absolute returns. So how do you get that right? You need specialists who have an edge in a particular strategy, right? And they need a portfolio construction or risk management approach that maximizes that edge, maximizes the capacity of dollars they can earn off of those advantages that they have, and minimizing the things that can create large drawdowns that they don‚Äôt really have, you know, edge and betting on. And so that‚Äôs the analysis that you‚Äôre constantly running and iterating on with the teams. 00:44:48 [Speaker Changed] So I heard a, a fund manager say, we have no competition because none of us in our space have market share. For the most part, we‚Äôre all less than 1% market share. How do you look at the competitive environment for other multi-strat firms? It seems like animal up and you get a decent number, but there are, what are there 11,000 hedge funds? 00:45:12 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. The way we think about it is we‚Äôre not really competing with 11,000 hedge funds. So I think what you‚Äôve seen over the last, you know, 20 plus years is a consistent market share gain from the larger platform firms, right? And now I think there‚Äôs really like four or five that, right? And if you look at the private equity industry, it‚Äôs pretty similar. Like there‚Äôs probably more than 10,000 private equity funds, but the vast majority of dollars, vast majority of alpha, the vast majority of people are really at, you know, half a dozen 00:45:47 [Speaker Changed] Fathead long tail. 00:45:49 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. So the hedge fund industry‚Äôs really headed in that same, you know, direction. So we really compete with, you know, half a dozen firms. And now there‚Äôs also competition from some of the high frequency firms that are kind of going upstream to some of the longer duration discretionary strategies. And, you know, we‚Äôre doing more quantitative stuff going the other way, right? So maybe there‚Äôs a couple more, but you‚Äôre really competing with half a dozen to a dozen firms that are running, you know, specialist strategies at scale. And then everyone else in those strategies you kinda look at as like a generalist, you know, participant. And it‚Äôs great to have generalist participation. We want as much as possible from, you know, retail, from other funds, from, you know, prop, from banks. Like, like the more liquidity there is, the more generous participation there is. You know, I think the better for specialized firms. 00:46:39 [Speaker Changed] So the current environment kind of hard to compare to any other era. On the one hand we had a fairly robust economy coming into 2025 following a whole bunch of fed hikes. Now we‚Äôre expected to resume fed cutting by the time this airs. Were probably 25 paces points lower than where we are today. The whole tariff start stop. And now back to the litigation the Supreme Court agreed to take to that, it looks like inflation is starting to percolate a little bit as the labor market seems to soften. How does the firm look at all of these macro cross currents? Are they significant or are they just background noise or somewhere in between? Well, 00:47:23 [Speaker Changed] I would just say it‚Äôs a really interesting fluid environment, particularly for, for macro and, and long short equities because there‚Äôs just so much change. So if, if you think about like what is the worst environment to be in? It‚Äôs not when everything is clear. Because when everything is clear, there‚Äôs like no volatility, there‚Äôs no change, right? It‚Äôs hard to get any dispersion. So that environment might be good for passive strategies, but not, not good. 00:47:51 [Speaker Changed] Sideways markets don‚Äôt really help. 00:47:52 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Yeah. So now there‚Äôs a ton of money sloshing around trying to figure things out. And that‚Äôs a, that‚Äôs a great environment, right? So if you think about this here on the macro perspective, right? You went from a very, you know, positive view in January of how everything was gonna play out to, you know, kind of the tariff mess and very pessimistic view of how, you know, the US was gonna play out and, and what was gonna happen with markets we‚Äôre down 20% in the s and p briefly, and now you‚Äôre, you know, right back up and still, like a lot of things kinda swirling around as to how it‚Äôs gonna play out. To your point on rates and inflation‚Äôs been a lot of change. It‚Äôs created a lot of relative value opportunities as you get different hiking cycles, different cutting cycles and in different markets, like that‚Äôs great for macro in equity land, you have all the changes, not just from the economy but from AI and how that‚Äôs impacting tech, but also impacting companies that are customers or gonna be run over because of ai. Like creates great long short opportunities. So I think it‚Äôs a really fascinating market. I don‚Äôt have any giant, you know, prediction of how things are gonna, you know, play out tomorrow. But if you have strong teams who are on top of the latest data points and you can figure it out a little bit ahead of the next person. Just tremendous opportunities. Like this last week, Oracle report a quarter, you know, giant company. Crazy 00:49:18 [Speaker Changed] 37%, right? For for a giant, 00:49:20 [Speaker Changed] Giant company, 00:49:21 [Speaker Changed] Right? Giant company. Amazing. 00:49:22 [Speaker Changed] I mean, when was the last time, you know, a company like that moved 35, 37, 7 00:49:26 [Speaker Changed] Unbeliev quarter, unbelievable, right? the.com collapse and it was in the wrong direction. 00:49:29 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I mean, amazing, right? So if you could figure that out or, you know, I think a, some of these, you know, FinTech companies circle went public, right? Usually public offerings are like pretty efficiently priced, you know, this one goes up 400% after it starts trading, right? And then it goes down 50%, you know, and a month after that. So in the first three months, like think of the travel and the stock. So amazing opportunities, right? If, if your teams can figure that out. So, you know, we‚Äôre out there working hard doing the research and you know, figuring out the market. 00:49:59 [Speaker Changed] So it doesn‚Äôt sound like you think the AI theme is overdone, but it certainly is creating a little more volatility and a little more opportunities. 00:50:08 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I think the reality when we look back, you know, in 10 years or in 20 years in the actual outcomes that have happened, it‚Äôs probably under hyped really in terms of the stock re of the stock prices across the board. Like that‚Äôs harder to say. Like there‚Äôs some that are probably way over hype. There‚Äôs some that‚Äôre probably under a lot of companies have moved from one bucket to another where they were in a loser bucket and actually they turns out maybe they‚Äôre a winner or vice versa, where people got too optimistic and maybe they don‚Äôt really have anything that‚Äôs defensible and differentiated. So I think there‚Äôs a lot of alpha to be gained in figuring that out. And it‚Äôs hard to find things that are, you know, super bargain priced that have anything to do with ai. But in terms of like the longer term potential to really transform how people work and how companies work, I, I, I think it‚Äôs probably under hyped. I, 00:51:04 [Speaker Changed] I I, I‚Äôve been fond of, of thinking of this in terms of, hey, the magnificent sevens certainly have been overhyped, but the magnificent 4 93 people haven‚Äôt really been paying attention to 00:51:17 [Speaker Changed] That. Well, yeah, I mean, it‚Äôs a good question. Like have they been overhyped, right? If you look at the dollars in earnings and cash flow that they‚Äôre generating pretty impressive in the market caps that they‚Äôre growing. Like I think they‚Äôre, you know, executing amazingly, amazingly well. I think it‚Äôs quite different from what we had in the, in the.com era where companies weren‚Äôt really making, making money. So that‚Äôs one difference. The other 4 93, I think there‚Äôs a lot of, you know, headwinds and tailwinds. So some companies are gonna figure it out, right? And they‚Äôre gonna kind of make the leap into the future and figure out how to be much more efficient. And you‚Äôre starting to see that in some of the commentary on the earnings calls where margins inflect positively for, you know, the way that they figured out how to leverage the tech and others are gonna disappear, right? So I think it‚Äôs gonna create a lot of opportunities. 00:52:10 [Speaker Changed] So the trader in me sees, we‚Äôre recording this on the 15th, another set of all time highs. I always learned on the desk, all time highs are bullish. What, what‚Äôs your perspective on all time highs? 00:52:23 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I, I think like you have this two-tiered market that you mentioned where you have the kind of tech leaders and, and the AI leaders and, and everything else, everything else. Companies definitely got hurt more with all the tariff ups and downs or, and inflation ups and downs earlier this year. That seems to be certainly calming down. And the partially, you know, top down as calming down and partially bottom up, companies are figuring out, you know, how to navigate these things and maybe it‚Äôs not as, as troublesome as they thought. And so you‚Äôre seeing like better execution and probably a little bit more po positivity from companies than you were seeing, you know, certainly six months ago. And that‚Äôs starting to get reflected and the market‚Äôs broadening out a little bit. But, you know, the largest, you know, tech companies certainly have, you know, tremendous advantages that they‚Äôre continuing to press. 00:53:24 [Speaker Changed] So last of our regular questions, what are traders and investors not thinking about or talking about, but perhaps should be? What topics, assets, geography, policy, data points, what‚Äôs getting overlooked but shouldn‚Äôt, 00:53:39 [Speaker Changed] I think it‚Äôs, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs getting overlooked, but I would say when you think about ai, where it‚Äôs going, what are the ramifications for every type of company, right? So at the moment, while AI is making us much more productive and efficient, we haven‚Äôt let go of one person because AI has automated their job, right? Like, we‚Äôre just hiring more AI people, right? But if you look out, you know, five years from now, is that still gonna be the case? You know, probably not, right? Like some jobs are gonna get automated, right? And, you know, we‚Äôre kind of on the, you know, high end I would say of, you know, skills that are necessary to, to work at a leading hedge fund. If you think of like a typical company where there‚Äôs a lot of folks doing like very bureaucratic type of things, like a lot of pretty mundane tasks, like all that stuff is gonna be automated. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs in a year or in five years, like, but somewhere in that timeframe it‚Äôs gonna be automated. So when you think about 00:54:36 [Speaker Changed] Starting to SeeThrough, we started with the entry level jobs. Yeah. Under 30 unemployment is like 9.9%. Yeah. Double regular unemployment. 00:54:44 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, exactly. And so as, as you think about that, like what does that mean for every type of company, right? If you, if you‚Äôre a company that can really harness that and you could produce your products, your services at a much lower price point, and you figure that out ahead of the competition, like your margins might explode to the upside. On the other hand, if everybody in your space is doing that, like maybe your margins are actually gonna collapse, right? Because everybody‚Äôs gonna drive down pricing. And then how does it flow downstream? Like do you need as much office space if you‚Äôre gonna have less people in a particular area, right? So like all these kind of things, I think everyone is focused because there is a lot of volatility. Everyone is focused very much on like the next quarter. But if you think out, you know, 2, 3, 4 years, like how‚Äôs this space gonna look? Right? And that‚Äôs kind of the balance of trading and investing the work. You know, you gotta have one eye on each. 00:55:33 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. And, and before I get to my favorite questions that I ask all of my guests, I have to ask you about some of the philanthropy you participate in. Tell us a little bit about the Atlas Fellowship and some of the other things that you‚Äôve been doing over the past couple years. 00:55:49 [Speaker Changed] Sure. So this was a, a, a program that my wife Rebecca and I started, I think this is five years ago now. We were looking to start an initiative to help kids go to college who were a bit under resourced, maybe first in their family to go to college, et cetera. And as we‚Äôre looking at these scholarship opportunities, particularly in finance, we couldn‚Äôt find any program that had a combination of internships with scholarships. There were some that had ones that were captive to a particular company, but then you were, you know, beholden to work just at that company forever. But there wasn‚Äôt anything that was diverse, right. Where someone could get real exposure across the industry. And so that‚Äôs what we started with, with Atlas Fellows, where we give kids who are super bright, driven, merit-based scholarships. Right? So these are like top students in the class a lot of times from diverse backgrounds, from with no connections to finance. Right. And they get scholarships of up to 20 grand a year for four years. And in addition to that, they get fully paid internships at finance firms for all four 00:56:59 [Speaker Changed] Years. Not just your firm, but a Exactly. A broad variety. 00:57:02 [Speaker Changed] Exactly. So we take ‚Äôem, their, their first internship when they‚Äôre coming outta high school, and that one is typically done at BAM. And they work either on our investing teams, our data teams, our tech teams, our business teams. And then the next year they go to work at a bank, or they go to work at another hedge fund, or they go to work at a prop firm or a VC firm. And every year they, they rotate. And we just had the first cohort graduate last year. They all got jobs in finance, some in Chicago, some in New York. And employers are really competing over the kids. Like they‚Äôre super smart, driven, passionate kids. And now they‚Äôve had four years of finance internships at top firms. So I, I think it‚Äôs working really well and we‚Äôre working to, to scale it 00:57:43 [Speaker Changed] Up. They, they become a hot, hot commodity. Yeah, 00:57:46 [Speaker Changed] Exactly. And just like the fun, like now we got a hundred kids in the program and, and we‚Äôre trying to really scale it up to hundreds. Wow. 00:57:51 [Speaker Changed] That‚Äôs great. Alright, so let‚Äôs jump to our favorite questions that we ask all of our guests. Starting with, we talked about mentorship at bam. Let‚Äôs talk about who were your mentors, who shaped your career? You mentioned Steve Schoenfeld, he had to be significant. Tell us about him and anybody else that made a 00:58:10 [Speaker Changed] Difference. Sure. Yeah. I, I think what, what Steven did really well at the time in the firm was it was a super entrepreneurial type of environment. Everyone was kind of in, in business running your own little business, right? And most folks kind of stayed as one man shops, right? As a one man trading unit, right? But I had the oppor opportunity to kind of build that into a unit of, you know, five and then 10, and then 20, and then 30. And then, you know, then we spun off. So just the, the freedom and support, you know, to, to do that was really helpful. Right? And then a lot of business learnings from, you know, seeing how we allocated to different people, seeing how they manage risk. Like that was very, you know, very helpful. And then philosophically, I would say the biggest impact was reading Atla Shrugged in College, which I read in a English class in, in college. And that really kind of articulated a, a moral, you know, philosophical framework around which I think it makes it much easier to build a successful business. Right? 00:59:21 [Speaker Changed] He hence the name Atlas. 00:59:23 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, exactly. The name of our fund and the name of, you know, our, our scholarship program. I think a lot of times people have all sorts of conflicts with, you know, being successful and at the same time, you know, being a good person and, and helping the world. And I don‚Äôt actually think there‚Äôs any conflicts. And that objective is philosophy in her work. Like really does a good job of laying that scaffolding for people. And I think it makes it, you know, much more fulfilling and less conflicted to also be, be successful in all realms. 00:59:59 [Speaker Changed] So since you mentioned Atlas Shrugged, let‚Äôs talk about books. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right now? 01:00:05 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, that, that‚Äôs definitely the number one. The current one that‚Äôs on my bookshelf is a fun one. It‚Äôs from this explorer. I didn‚Äôt know there were explorers anymore, but there are apparently, and we had this guy Mike Horn, at our VC conference. We do like a public private VC conference every year called Elevate. And we had him as a guest speaker. And we, we had two guest speakers this year. We had Steve Kerr, the coach of the Warriors, and we had Mike Horn and Steve went first and he was amazing and a great, you know, stories on teamwork and, and collaboration and work ethic and Michael Jordan‚Äôs stories and stuff, currency stories. So it was great. And then Mike had to follow him and I was like, oh my God, how is this guy gonna follow us? It‚Äôs a follow, it‚Äôs a follow, right? And my partner Scott brought him, brought him on and, and Scott‚Äôs created finding like talent that‚Äôs, you know, other folks haven‚Äôt discovered yet. 01:00:56 And this guy, you know, has circumvented the equator several times around the world. You know, self-powered walking, et cetera. He‚Äôs gone to North Pole, south Pole, swam to Amazon, like all these, you know, insane stories. One after another. And he‚Äôs, he‚Äôs got a book called, I think it‚Äôs called Nothing is Impossible, or something along those lines. And you started like, you shake hands with this guy, and he‚Äôs not like a particularly big guy, but he like crushed my hand and I go, Mike, how do you get? And he‚Äôs 60 years old, how do you get this handshake? Oh my God. He‚Äôs like, well I, you know, kite surfed across the Antarctica and that involves, you know, holding a kite across, you know, frozen Antarctica for 14 hours a day as this huge wind is pulling you along. And it‚Äôs like, okay, that‚Äôs, that‚Äôs how you get 01:01:43 [Speaker Changed] Builds up a little grip 01:01:44 [Speaker Changed] Strength. That‚Äôs how you get some grip strength. Yeah. But he had like these amazing survival stories and just mental fortitude stories that I think really relate to trading and investing. So he was an awesome speaker. And so I just got his book. 01:01:58 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Have you ever read Endurance the Shackleton story? 01:02:01 [Speaker Changed] Yes, yes. I read it, watched the movie. That one was hard to sit through. 01:02:05 [Speaker Changed] The book is just, yeah. Like it couldn‚Äôt be fiction ‚Äôcause nothing is believed. Yeah. It‚Äôs so amazing. It had to be real. Yeah. 01:02:12 [Speaker Changed] This is along those lines, but less abusive and much more fun. 01:02:16 [Speaker Changed] Let‚Äôs talk about streaming. Anything interesting that you‚Äôre watching or listening to these days? 01:02:22 [Speaker Changed] I mean, shows I like, I I really enjoyed the Three Body Problem, those on Netflix. That was a fun one. And then 01:02:27 [Speaker Changed] Books, the book is a tough slog. 01:02:28 [Speaker Changed] I read the book actually afterwards, 01:02:30 [Speaker Changed] So it‚Äôs a little challenging. It‚Äôs a, because it‚Äôs originally in Chinese Yeah. Chinese and Transit book. But the show is really, the 01:02:36 [Speaker Changed] Show is really good. And, and the, and the books, the books like the creativity in the books are really fun. Mm. So that was a good one. You know, Yellowstone is great. So the usual ones there on listening to, I think podcasts are like the greatest invention in the last, you know, five, 10 years of, of, not that they weren‚Äôt around before, but like popularized in terms of being able to just expand your, your knowledge set in a very efficient way. So I try to listen to as many as I can. I, I listen to, you know, a lot of yours, I listen to a lot of Tim Ferriss‚Äô. He‚Äôs got all sorts of super interesting people on there that invest like the best ones. There‚Äôs a ton on there. So there‚Äôs a lot of finance ones, there‚Äôs a lot of VC ones I enjoy. I was just listening to one. They had Vinod Kla and then another one with Mark Andreessen, and they‚Äôre just like, super thought provoking. And so I, I encourage like all our young people coming up that, that ask just, you know, you have this like amazing resource you could tap, you know, Spotify and, and you got, you know, a thousand different podcasts from World‚Äôs Best people in every field that you can listen to sharing their insights. 01:03:37 [Speaker Changed] There‚Äôs no excuse to be bored these 01:03:39 [Speaker Changed] Days. No, it‚Äôs amazing. I remember when I was coming up and I wanted to hear like, how do hedge funds make money? Right? Like, you couldn‚Äôt figure that out. Like if you had no connectivity to a hedge fund. Like how are you gonna figure that out? You read Market Wizards and now what? Right. But besides, besides that, reading all the books that are available now, like the podcast, like amazing resource. 01:03:58 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. Our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career in either trading, investing, multi-Strat hedge funds? 01:04:09 [Speaker Changed] I mean, one is just follow your curiosity, which hopefully leads to a passion of something that you wanna really do, right? Don‚Äôt go into finance, hedge funds, whatever it is, because your, your friend is making a lot of money, right? Like, you gotta be interested in the work. Like you gotta be driven and curious and hopefully passionate about what it is that you‚Äôre doing because, you know, it‚Äôs like pro sports or anything else. Like, just because you know LeBron makes a lot of money doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre gonna go make a lot of money playing basketball, right? You know, one, you know, he‚Äôs six 11, but besides that, like, he‚Äôs put in a lot of work over the years, right? And it‚Äôs because he loves the game of basketball, right? If you don‚Äôt love it, you‚Äôre not gonna put in the work and in trading for sure, if you‚Äôre, if you don‚Äôt love the process and you don‚Äôt love sitting there looking at the screen and trying to figure things out, you‚Äôre not gonna survive the emotional ups and downs. 01:05:06 ‚Äôcause there‚Äôs lots of downs in addition to the ups when things work out. So that‚Äôs the first thing. The second thing I would say is go to a firm that‚Äôs growing, right? And where there‚Äôs a culture that where you can learn from others, right? Where you can get good mentorship, there‚Äôs top people you can learn from, and you‚Äôll have some amount of access to be able to, to do that. The particular thing that they‚Äôre trading or investing or how they‚Äôre doing it, the, like, that‚Äôs a lot less important. ‚Äôcause you, you might change, the company might change. And then the third thing is like, once you‚Äôre in a seat, that‚Äôs a decent seat, you know, ask for feedback. Like, here‚Äôs what I did, here‚Äôs what I think I could have done. You know, what do you think? Right? Don‚Äôt ask for feedback when the market opens or the person‚Äôs like in the middle of a, you know, disastrous day. But when things are quiet, right? Early, late, right lunch hour, like, you know, get, get feedback proactively, right? Don‚Äôt sit around waiting for your year end review to see how things are going and, you know, iterate it together with, you know, the people that you‚Äôre working with. 01:06:13 [Speaker Changed] And our final question, what do you know about the world of capital markets trading, investing today that would‚Äôve been useful in 1994 when you were first starting out? 01:06:23 [Speaker Changed] I think the things that we‚Äôve been doing the last, you know, five years, I wish I had figured those out earlier. So investing more aggressively across strategies, right? I think we were too equity heavy for too long. We weren‚Äôt serious enough about how do you build those strategies outside of equities and not serious enough about hiring top people to manage those areas. And then building like all the tech and the infrastructure that you needed to really be competitive and leading in those areas. So I wish I would‚Äôve figured that out a little bit, a little bit earlier and pushed at it harder. But I think it‚Äôs on the, on the right trajectory now. 01:07:13 [Speaker Changed] Dmitri, thank you for being so generous with your time. This has been absolutely fascinating.

Title: Why Did Reddit Stock Drop 10%?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/29/why-did-reddit-stock-drop-10/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Reddit stock (NYSE:RDDT) dropped nearly 10% in the past week, in contrast to the nearly stable performance of the S&P 500 Index. The fluctuations in Reddit‚Äôs stock price are particularly notable when compared to its competitors, including Meta Platforms ‚Äì which fell about 3% during the week, Snap ‚Äì gaining around 8%, and Pinterest ‚Äì which dropped approximately 3%. The decline is indicative of investor worries regarding slower user growth and possible traffic challenges related to updates in Google‚Äôs search algorithms and AI-generated responses, which may impact engagement and advertising capacity on the platform. With the current share price hovering around $237, we believe Reddit could experience short-term challenges before stabilizing. Importantly, the stock is still significantly higher compared to its IPO valuation from early 2024 and has increased by 45% since late 2024, as outlined in our analysis of Why Reddit Stock Moved. However, for those looking for growth with less volatility than owning a single stock, the High Quality Portfolio is worth considering. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark, which consists of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes, achieving returns of over 91% since its launch. As a whole, the stocks in the HQ Portfolio have generated superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; offering less of a tumultuous experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Additionally, don‚Äôt miss ‚Äì Uber Stock To $200? Some of the increase in Reddit‚Äôs stock since its IPO can be attributed to the approximately 30% rise in its revenues from 2022 to 2024. Revenue growth surged in 2023 due to the introduction of new ad products and licensing agreements, and this trend continued into 2024 with ongoing growth in advertising and AI-related data licensing. Nevertheless, growth started to slow somewhat in early 2025 amid worries regarding traffic sources and user engagement patterns. Although Reddit has experienced steady revenue growth, its PS multiple has not broadened significantly. The company's PS multiple rose from around 10x in 2024 to almost 12x by mid-2025. While the company‚Äôs PS is currently above historical averages, there may be potential downside when comparing the current multiple to previous peaks ‚Äì roughly 15x in late 2024 and closer to 9x as recently as early 2023. In its latest quarter, Reddit declared revenue of approximately $240 million, reflecting an increase of more than 20% year-over-year, and recorded its second quarterly profit since its IPO. However, the daily active users count of 100 million was slightly under optimistic forecasts, raising concerns about market saturation and competition. For the full year of 2025, Reddit has projected revenue growth in the mid-20% range, but remarks regarding traffic uncertainty have made investors cautious. If the company can demonstrate resilience in user engagement and continue to enhance its ad products, the stock could potentially regain its upward trajectory. However, in the short term, volatility is expected to remain as investors weigh high valuation multiples against execution risks. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming its benchmark inclusive of all three ‚Äì S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap ‚Äî and has generated returns above 91% since its inception. What accounts for this success? As a collective, the stocks in the HQ Portfolio deliver better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in less of a tumultuous experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: CEO Talks: Jamie Salter on Building Authentic Brands Into a $32 Billion Juggernaut Over 15¬†Years

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily The founder and chief executive officer of the brand management and entertainment firm expects to transition to executive chairman in around two years. Senior Editor, Men's Jamie Salter has come a long way in the past 15 years. The 62-year-old Toronto native started his career in sports marketing and was the cofounder of Ride snowboards in the early 1990s. After that company went public, he and Fanatics‚Äô founder and executive chairman Michael Rubin created Global Sports Inc., which eventually became GSI Commerce. Once he exited that business, Salter turned his attention to licensing, cofounding Hilco Consumer Capital. After a difference of opinion with Hilco‚Äôs majority owner, he partnered with Leonard Green and created Authentic Brands Group. Related Articles Shoe Industry News Puma Shares Seesaw on Authentic Brands Group Takeover Speculation Fashion Features WWD's 115 Newsmakers: S to Z Today, Authentic has amassed a portfolio that encompasses more than 50 brands including Reebok, Brooks Brothers and Champion that generate annual retail sales of $32 billion globally. The addition of Guess by early year will bring that number to $38 billion. But that‚Äôs not good enough for Salter, whose goal is to reach $100 billion in sales within the next five years by purchasing brands that have sales of more than $1 billion with global expansion potential while also expanding his reach in the entertainment and hospitality sectors. You May Also Like Authentic, which is on track to post 7 percent organic growth from its brands this year, now has headquarters in New York, London and Shanghai and offices in Los Angeles, Miami, Tokyo and South Korea. It counts 1,800 licensing partners globally, and its licensees operate 16,000 stores and 29,000 shops-in-shop around the world. The group is by far the largest of what is a new wave of brand management companies, which are rewriting the fashion and retail landscape in the U.S. by snapping up brand seemingly every week. While it‚Äôs a model that first emerged in the U.S. almost 50 years ago, Authentic and the likes of WHP Global, Bluestar and Marquee Brands are now taking it to another level. Here, Salter talks about his journey, how he‚Äôs built Authentic and his plans to pass the reins to the newly named president, Matt Maddox, within the next two years. WWD: How has the licensing model evolved since you started 15 years ago? Jamie Salter: It‚Äôs dramatically different. When we came into the business, Iconix was really the prize in the industry. It was doing DTR [direct-to-retail] with big retailers, and it was very item driven and category specific. When I looked at the business back then, I always asked the question, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt they sell home and shoes and whatever?‚Äù Well, it wasn‚Äôt because they didn‚Äôt want to, but they had a DTR [strategy]. So I said, OK, I know they‚Äôre doing really well, but that‚Äôs not going to work for us. We have to have another angle on how can we do well in the licensing business. So we took a different approach. WWD: And what was that? J.S.: Our approach was we‚Äôre going to go after wholesalers, and we‚Äôre going to do it by category and by territory, and they‚Äôre going to have to sell into retailers. That was very different from what Iconix was doing. So you could say we got lucky, or you could say we‚Äôre smart. I would say it‚Äôs probably a little bit of both. But what it really proved to me was you could actually grow the businesses so much bigger. WWD: Was there a downside? J.S.: You could argue our model was more expensive to run than a traditional licensing model, because we had to put a lot of money from the royalties that we were collecting into marketing. In the beginning, we weren‚Äôt putting enough into the marketing side of the business, but we learned very early on ‚Äî when my partner Nick [Woodhouse] came into the business ‚Äî that we really had to spend money on marketing. But we couldn‚Äôt afford it. It was hard. WWD: But I assume you decided to make the investment? J.S.: I met a guy named Adam Kronengold who is still with me today. He‚Äôs our chief digital officer. He was one of our first employees and in his interview, he asked me how many social media followers I had. I said, ‚ÄúWhat do you mean? Me? Jamie Salter?‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúNo, not you, your company.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really understand the question.‚Äù So he goes on Instagram and says, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have an account.‚Äù This is in 2010, and he said, ‚ÄúMarilyn Monroe has an account. She has 250,000 followers. You know you can talk to people, post stuff and market.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúHow much does that cost?‚Äù He says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs free. You can put up a post, send your message and tell people where Marilyn Monroe is being sold. You can do whatever you want. It‚Äôs your channel.‚Äù WWD: Guess he convinced you. J.S.: I asked him how Instagram made money and he said it didn‚Äôt make a lot then, but their whole strategy was to get everybody on social media and eventually turn it into an advertising platform. I said, ‚ÄúI like free ‚Äî you‚Äôre hired.‚Äù So we were one of the very early adopters in the social media world. I think that is really the base of Authentic Brands ‚Äî we really built the company like a tech start-up. Here we are 15 years after and we‚Äôre still like a start-up in the way we think. We‚Äôre always on the cusp of what‚Äôs next. WWD: How do you differ from the other brand management companies you compete with today like WHP Global, Marquee Brands and Bluestar? J.S.: We welcome competition, and we want them to do well, because if they do well, it‚Äôs good for us. But everyone builds a niche for themselves. WHP is using the Iconix/Sequential playbook and they‚Äôve transitioned from that a little bit. I think Yehuda [Shmidman, WHP‚Äôs chief executive officer] learned some good hard lessons through his experience there and he‚Äôs building a pretty good platform [at WHP]. But scale matters now in this business because of the money you have to spend in order to build these brands and keep them relevant in the marketplace. We have a big international platform and nobody else really has that. But where we‚Äôre really separate from them is that we have 80 people in the marketing department today, we have 700 million social media followers ‚Äî that‚Äôs 10 percent of the people that live on the planet. We‚Äôre on TikTok and WeChat and Instagram and Red Note ‚Äî we‚Äôre on every platform around the globe. We have social media influencers in 150 different languages. WWD: Is that why you‚Äôre often always the first call when a brand is for sale? J.S.: If you have an opportunity to partner with Authentic versus Bluestar versus WHP, you‚Äôre going to partner with Authentic if it‚Äôs the same economics, just because it‚Äôs a much bigger platform. We can actually pay more because our platform is so efficient. And we can run businesses more efficiently because of our sheer size. WWD: You swooped in at the last minute to buy Guess even though WHP already had a deal. What happened there? J.S.: They always say anything‚Äôs for sale for the right price. But that‚Äôs just not true. [Guess cofounder] Paul Marciano was looking for a partner and unless he got the best deal for his shareholders, he would never have sold the company. So he‚Äôs selling 51 percent to us, and the family [with CEO Carlos Alberini] will own other 49 percent. Relationships matter, strategy matters, legacy matters. Paul‚Äôs last name is on the door. Look at LVMH: the family is all involved in the business and I think that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs such an incredible company. They learned from their father and they care ‚Äî the legacy lives on. My name is on the door too ‚Äî Authentic is the Salters. My family will be involved with Authentic Brands forever, I hope. WWD: All four of your sons are in the business, right? J.S.: Yes. And at some point, Jamie Salter will have to hang up the skates as I get older. WWD: In January, you brought in Matt Maddox, the former CEO of Wynn Resorts, as president. What is his role? J.S.: He worked with Steve Wynn for 22 years and for the last four or five years, was CEO of Wynn Properties. Everyone asked me why I didn‚Äôt hire someone from the fashion business. Look, we‚Äôre in the licensing business, which means we‚Äôre effectively a landlord. We buy these great brands, we fix them up, we market them and we rent out rooms. And the rooms happen to be shoes and socks and intimate apparel and home goods. And we do that by territory, by category. Matt understood the retail luxury space, because he has his own mall at the Wynn. He understood that he has to rent out his rooms every day. He has to market. He understood the entertainment business and events and celebrities and athletes. He has relationships with all these. We knew a lot of the same people and were partners with the Wynn through our live events division. WWD: Sounds like a good match. J.S.: Matt was offered some of the biggest jobs in the United States and initially he said no to me [when I offered him the job]. I asked him why and he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve looked at your business. It‚Äôs working really well. You‚Äôre doing an incredible job. You‚Äôre not going anywhere. You don‚Äôt need me.‚Äù So I called Steve [Wynn] and told him he had to convince Matt to take the job. He did and we hired Matt. WWD: What are your ultimate plans for Matt? J.S.: I made a commitment to Matt that he would become the CEO of the company in the next two years. I will move to executive chairman. And you know, people ask me, ‚ÄúAre you OK with that?‚Äù Well, I‚Äôm super excited. Matt is 49, he‚Äôs young, he‚Äôs beyond smart. He‚Äôs working incredibly well with the team. He‚Äôs working great with my children, which is really important to me. He‚Äôs mentoring my son, Corey, who, you know, I ultimately want one day to run the company with his brothers. But I‚Äôve got an incredible partner in Matt, who I believe will lead Authentic to $100 billion. WWD: The business community is filled with founders who find they can‚Äôt actually step aside when they turn over the reins to someone else. Why is this different? J.S.: Like I told Matt, I‚Äôm not going anywhere. But we‚Äôve got to stay young; we‚Äôve got to stay nimble. He understands the loyalty side of the business better than me because they had a big loyalty program at the Wynn. He understands the digital side of the business. He‚Äôs doing an unbelievable job upgrading Authentic on the process side. And if we do decide to go public over the next year or two, he‚Äôll be an excellent CEO that the Street can rely on. I‚Äôm excited to just continue doing what I‚Äôm really good at, which is building great relationships around the world and working on the M&A side, and I have a great partner in Matt to run the day-to-day. WWD: Sounds like hiring someone from outside the fashion industry is working out for you. J.S.: I‚Äôm a big believer in hiring outside the industry ‚Äî not that we don‚Äôt hire inside the industry, because we still need merchants and great marketing people. But if you really look at Authentic, the average age here is about 35. And they come out of the digital space, the legal space, the finance system. Authentic is a big marketing department, a big legal department, a big digital department. So, we‚Äôre hiring people from Meta and Google and Microsoft and Amazon. You still need merchants to touch and feel and make great product, because you can have the greatest digital team and the greatest marketing team but if don‚Äôt have good product, then it doesn‚Äôt work. But at the end of the day, data is everything. WWD: What do you look for when you‚Äôre hiring people? J.S.: When you‚Äôre hot, you attract great talent. When I‚Äôm hiring someone, the first question I ask is, can AI do this job? If the answer is no, the second question is: is that person smarter than you? And we‚Äôre a loyal group, so if you‚Äôre really good, you‚Äôre going to be here forever. But Authentic is not for everyone. Do not come here if you‚Äôre looking for a 9-to-5 job because we work 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We‚Äôre a global company, so we‚Äôre always working. With the globalization of the world, the internet, social media, the news cycles and staying ahead of trends and culture, you always have to be on. WWD: You also have other components to your business beyond brand management. J.S.: Yes. Twenty-five percent of the platform is entertainment. [Our competitors] don‚Äôt have an entertainment business. And entertainment, in my opinion, drives fashion culture. The entertainment business is really music culture and sports culture, which is where we have a big edge. The other 75 percent of our turnover is rooted in the lifestyle space. WWD: How do you evolve the company going forward, where are the opportunities? J.S.: We think we‚Äôre just scratching the surface. I know people think that‚Äôs kind of crazy with a business that has about $32 billion in annual retail systemwide sales. But we think we can be about $100 billion within the next five years. It‚Äôs not as crazy as you think when we pull off deals like Guess, which does $6 billion at retail. There are lots of other brands that are in that $1 billion to $10 billion range that we could buy. And we really, truly believe that we will crack those opportunities. Over the next five years, we‚Äôll do another four or five big deals and that‚Äôs another $50 billion. This year alone, and the year is not over, we added almost $7 billion in revenue. WWD: You were close to going public a couple of years ago and then decided against it. Are you revisiting the idea? J.S.: Authentic is a very different model. We trade like a tech company because we are a tech company. Think about it. When you have 75 percent margin, 99 percent cash conversion and virtually no capex, you trade like a software company. So could we be public? The answer is yes. Should we be public? I don‚Äôt know. There‚Äôs no need to be. Why is SpaceX not public? It doesn‚Äôt need to be. We trade at a very high multiple; we have 36 percent growth in the company. We‚Äôre low levered. We took our first money from Leonard Green in 2010 and the company has been self-funded since then. WWD: But you have other investors including General Atlantic, BlackRock, CVC Capital Partners, Simon Property Group and Brookfield, among others. J.S.: True. There‚Äôs been $9 billion of secondaries in the last three years, but that‚Äôs just one shareholder selling to a new buyer. There‚Äôs been no need for investment from outside. We actually just bought $1 billion of stock back and retired the shares, so the company‚Äôs very flush with cash. WWD: A lot of the brands you buy are distressed. Is that what you look for? J.S.: The brands aren‚Äôt necessarily distressed, the companies are. Reebok wasn‚Äôt a bad brand. Adidas just wasn‚Äôt putting the effort into one of the greatest athletic brands in the world. Their focus was on building Adidas. They milked Reebok as far as they possibly could, and they didn‚Äôt need it anymore. We‚Äôve owned Reebok now for a couple years and we‚Äôve almost doubled the business. We still have lots of work to do, but Reebok is a $6 billion business and our ambition is to grow to a $10 billion business over the next three years ‚Äî and we feel very confident we‚Äôre going to get there. WWD: So what is the criteria you use when exploring a purchase? J.S.: A good brand but a broken business. Champion wasn‚Äôt broken but Hanes needed liquidity. Truth be told, I spoke to Gildan before we bought Champion. I said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go buy Hanes together. I‚Äôll take Champion. You take Hanes.‚Äù We ended up buying Champion. They ended up buying Hanes, which is interesting. We could have done the deal together. Anyway, our model is to license by category, by territory, to best-in-class partners. So you get the best underwear-maker, you get the best sock-maker, you get the best sportswear-maker. It means the business grows much quicker. But we have to unwind the overhead so we can run these companies much more efficiently. People always say, ‚ÄúWhen you buy a company, all the jobs go away.‚Äù It‚Äôs not true ‚Äî lots of new jobs are created. When we look at our portfolio, I would say that probably 75 percent of the jobs either stay or new jobs are created. So maybe people lose their jobs in California, but there are new jobs in New York, and it‚Äôs more efficient. WWD: Where do you see the growth coming from in the future? J.S.: Entertainment and kids‚Äô animation. Those are two really big areas for us. We believe entertainment really does drive lifestyle. So we‚Äôre going to continue to drive that. And when I say the kids‚Äô space, think Disney, think Mattel, that type of stuff. And with Matt‚Äôs background, we‚Äôre moving into the hospitality business. We‚Äôve done multiple deals now for hotels and condos. We have the Barneys hotel. We have Sports Illustrated resorts, we have Eddie Bauer lodges. We have Nautica condos going up in Mexico. Our hospitality business is bigger than you would think. Also, beauty. Our beauty business is over a couple billion dollars today, but there‚Äôs big opportunity there. And you‚Äôre going to see us do more deals like David Beckham and Shaq. WWD: Speaking of Beckham and Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal, neither of them has been playing for a while. And you also own the rights to Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe, who are dead. J.S.: We don‚Äôt call them dead ‚Äî they‚Äôre icons, and with AI coming into play, Marilyn Monroe is going to be on fire in 2026, which is her 100th anniversary [of her birth]. We‚Äôve done an enormous number of deals around Marilyn Monroe. And don‚Äôt be surprised if you see her in movies again. And look at what‚Äôs going on with Elvis Presley. There was the movie and we now have an immersive theater production, Elvis Evolution, at the 02 in London. WWD: But how do you appeal to young people who don‚Äôt know Elvis and never saw Shaq or David Beckham play? J.S.: Shaq has never been bigger ‚Äî no pun intended. Shaq‚Äôs business is 10 times as big as when we partnered with him in 2015. And David Beckham‚Äòs business has doubled since we joined forces Now, we‚Äôve only been working on David‚Äôs business for a couple years ‚Äî Shaq‚Äôs we‚Äôve owned much longer. I‚Äôm not going to say live celebrities are better, but there are bigger opportunities than if they‚Äôre not with us anymore. WWD: Let‚Äôs talk about the Authentic Luxury Group. Can you explain what that is and how it‚Äôs working? J.S.: ALG is a joint venture between Saks Global and us that licenses the IP of the Saks brands and select Authentic premium brands. Richard [Baker, executive chairman of Saks Global] has had a bit of a bumpy road. He is a total optimist and a great visionary, but he needs to prove to the world that financially, he‚Äôs set up properly. It seems he‚Äôs on the right track now but we‚Äôre going to continue to be careful. We‚Äôre going to continue to build the affordable luxury ‚Äî or premium ‚Äî side of our business. Luxury is a word you have to be careful with. LVMH is luxury, Kering is luxury, Prada is luxury. Vince is premium, Brooks Brothers is premium, Hugo Boss is premium. We‚Äôll continue to play in the premium space in a big way, because it‚Äôs the next level from where we are today. We have the full support of Saks, Neiman‚Äôs and Amazon, because that‚Äôs the joint venture, and we‚Äôll fully support Richard and his journey. But we‚Äôre going to be careful. WWD: Are you still looking to buy Marc Jacobs? J.S.: I can‚Äôt really comment on that. What I will tell you is we will continue to look at companies in that space, like Marc Jacobs, and we‚Äôll see where it goes. WWD: Let‚Äôs talk about the whole department store and retail space where you have a lot of partners. It‚Äôs not easy out there. J.S.: We have to go where the customers go. If T.J. Maxx is a winner, we‚Äôve got to sell them. if Burlington, Target and Walmart are winners, we‚Äôve got to sell them. The consumption is the same as it was a year ago ‚Äî people aren‚Äôt buying any less product. They‚Äôre just buying from different places. So we continue to go where the customers go, and that‚Äôs really been our model. We think independent retailers, or omnichannel retailers like Lucky or Brooks Brothers, are actually important to building these brands. It‚Äôs tough, but it‚Äôs important to the model. Today, we have about 6,000 licensed full-price/outlet stores around the globe. And then there are another 24,000 shops-in-shop. So when you really look at our portfolio, half of our volume is done through stores that have our name above the door, and that‚Äôs a big investment. It‚Äôs going to take a long time before Kohl‚Äôs and JCPenney and Macy‚Äôs are not here anymore. But they‚Äôve got to continue to reinvent themselves. Great retailers survive. Look at Harrods: it‚Äôs packed wall-to-wall all the time. WWD: Why do you think that is? J.S.: It may be the model: a department store made up of all concessions. It doesn‚Äôt matter what concession [shop] you go into, one‚Äôs better than the next one ‚Äî they‚Äôre all just amazing. Take food: you can‚Äôt just have a food hall anymore, you have to have restaurants. Look at David Simon [head of Simon Properties]: everyone asks why his stock is so high. It‚Äôs because he reinvents himself all the time. He never gets stale. So when you go into a Simon mall, it‚Äôs busier than everyone else‚Äôs because he‚Äôs constantly looking at the best brands and reshuffling things. I don‚Äôt think the mall is dead. I think the mall is very alive ‚Äî if you‚Äôre in the right malls. And I don‚Äôt think the department store is dead. It just needs to be reinvented. Now, are we over-retailed in America? The answer is yes. That‚Äôs why going online is critical. If you want to be in this business, you‚Äôve got to go where the customers go. WWD: There‚Äôs a lot of criticism about the licensing model. Why are you so enamored with it? J.S.: There are two types of licensing. One really comes out of the animation business. Look at Disney: it‚Äôs the greatest company in the world. And what do they do? They make movies. They make TV shows. Then they have the parks where they sell you a lot of merchandise. I‚Äôve got that same attitude. Authentic has content and experiences and if we continue to do that, we can license our brands and be successful. If you‚Äôre just brand slapping and there‚Äôs no meat behind it, I think you will die a slow death. You have to treat your brands like your children. You can‚Äôt give them back. If you don‚Äôt constantly maintain your brands, you‚Äôre not going to win. And I think that‚Äôs where licensing gets a bad reputation. Disney has done an unbelievable job ‚Äî we think they‚Äôre the best of the best of the best. They‚Äôre number one, we‚Äôre number two, and they‚Äôre way above us. But we‚Äôre working hard every single day to continue to make this a better place.

Title: The Case Against Generative AI

Time Published: 2025-09-29T00:00:00Z
Full Content:
Soundtrack: Queens of the Stone Age - First It Giveth Before we go any further: This is, for the third time this year, the longest newsletter I've ever written, weighing in somewhere around 18,500 words. I've written it specifically to be read at your leisure ‚Äî dip in and out where you'd like ‚Äî but also in one go. This is my comprehensive case that yes, we‚Äôre in a bubble, one that will inevitably (and violently) collapse in the near future. I'll also be cutting this into a four-part episode starting tomorrow on my podcast Better Offline. I deeply appreciate your time. If you like this newsletter, please think about subscribing to the premium, which I write weekly. Thanks for reading. Alright, let‚Äôs do this one last time. In 2022, a (kind-of) company called OpenAI surprised the world with a website called ChatGPT that could generate text that sort-of sounded like a person using a technology called Large Language Models (LLMs), which can also be used to generate images, video and computer code. Large Language Models require entire clusters of servers connected with high-speed networking, all containing this thing called a GPU ‚Äî graphics processing units. These are different to the GPUs in your Xbox, or laptop, or gaming PC. They cost much, much more, and they‚Äôre good at doing the processes of inference (the creation of the output of any LLM) and training (feeding masses of training data to models, or feeding them information about what a good output might look like, so they can later identify a thing or replicate it). These models showed some immediate promise in their ability to articulate concepts or generate video, visuals, audio, text and code. They also immediately had one glaring, obvious problem: because they‚Äôre probabilistic, these models can‚Äôt actually be relied upon to do the same thing every single time. So, if you generated a picture of a person that you wanted to, for example, use in a story book, every time you created a new page, using the same prompt to describe the protagonist, that person would look different ‚Äî and that difference could be minor (something that a reader should shrug off), or it could make that character look like a completely different person. Moreover, the probabilistic nature of generative AI meant that whenever you asked it a question, it would guess as to the answer, not because it knew the answer, but rather because it was guessing on the right word to add in a sentence based on previous training data. As a result, these models would frequently make mistakes ‚Äî something which we later referred to as ‚Äúhallucinations.‚Äù And that‚Äôs not even mentioning the cost of training these models, the cost of running them, the vast amounts of computational power they required, the fact that the legality of using material scraped from books and the web without the owner‚Äôs permission was (and remains) legally dubious, or the fact that nobody seemed to know how to use these models to actually create profitable businesses. These problems were overshadowed by something flashy, and new, and something that investors ‚Äî and the tech media ‚Äî believed would eventually automate the single thing that‚Äôs proven most resistant to automation: namely, knowledge work and the creative economy. This newness and hype and these expectations sent the market into a frenzy, with every hyperscaler immediately creating the most aggressive market for one supplier I‚Äôve ever seen. NVIDIA has sold over $200 billion of GPUs since the beginning of 2023, becoming the largest company on the stock market and trading at over $170 as of writing this sentence only a few years after being worth $19.52 a share. While I‚Äôve talked about some of the propelling factors behind the AI wave ‚Äî automation and novelty ‚Äî that‚Äôs not a complete picture. A huge reason why everybody decided to ‚Äúdo AI‚Äù was because the software industry‚Äôs growth was slowing, with SaaS (Software As A Service) company valuations stalling or dropping, resulting in the terrifying prospect of companies having to ‚Äúunder promise and over deliver‚Äù and ‚Äúbe efficient.‚Äù Things that normal companies ‚Äî those whose valuations aren‚Äôt contingent on ever-increasing, ever-constant growth ‚Äî don‚Äôt have to worry about, because they‚Äôre normal companies. Suddenly, there was the promise of a new technology ‚Äî Large Language Models ‚Äî that were getting exponentially more powerful, which was mostly a lie but hard to disprove because ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù can mean basically anything, and the definition of ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù depended entirely on whoever you asked at any given time, and what that person‚Äôs motivations were. The media also immediately started tripping on its own feet, mistakenly claiming OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4 model tricked a Taskrabbit into solving a CAPTCHA (it didn‚Äôt ‚Äî this never happened), or saying that ‚Äúpeople who don‚Äôt know how to code already [used] bots to produce full-fledged games,‚Äù and if you‚Äôre wondering what ‚Äúfull-fledged‚Äù means, it means ‚Äúpong‚Äù and a cobbled-together rolling demo of SkyRoads, a game from 1993. The media (and investors) helped peddle the narrative that AI was always getting better, could do basically anything, and that any problems you saw today would be inevitably solved in a few short months, or years, or, well, at some point I guess. LLMs were touted as a digital panacea, and the companies building them offered traditional software companies the chance to plug these models into their software using an API, thus allowing them to ride the same generative AI wave that every other company was riding. The model companies similarly started going after individual and business customers, offering software and subscriptions that promised the world, though this mostly boiled down to chatbots that could generate stuff, and then doubled down with the promise of ‚Äúagents‚Äù ‚Äî a marketing term that‚Äôs meant to make you think ‚Äúautonomous digital worker‚Äù but really means ‚Äúbroken digital product.‚Äù Throughout this era, investors and the media spoke with a sense of inevitability that they never really backed up with data. It was an era based on confidently-asserted ‚Äúvibes.‚Äù Everything was always getting better and more powerful, even though there was never much proof that this was truly disruptive technology, other than in its ability to disrupt apps you were using with AI ‚Äî making them worse by, for example, suggesting questions on every Facebook post that you could ask Meta AI, but which Meta AI couldn‚Äôt answer. ‚ÄúAI‚Äù was omnipresent, and it eventually grew to mean everything and nothing. OpenAI would see its every move lorded over like a gifted child, its CEO Sam Altman called the ‚ÄúOppenheimer of Our Age,‚Äù even if it wasn‚Äôt really obvious why everyone was impressed. GPT-4 felt like something a bit different, but was it actually meaningful? The thing is, Artificial Intelligence is built and sold on not just faith, but a series of myths that the AI boosters expect us to believe with the same certainty that we treat things like gravity, or the boiling point of water. Can large language models actually replace coders? Not really, no, and I‚Äôll get into why later in the piece. Can Sora ‚Äî OpenAI‚Äôs video creation tool ‚Äî replace actors or animators? No, not at all, but it still fills the air full of tension because you can immediately see who is pre-registered to replace everyone that works for them. AI is apparently replacing workers, but nobody appears to be able to prove it! But every few weeks a story runs where everybody tries to pretend that AI is replacing workers with some poorly-sourced and incomprehensible study, never actually saying ‚Äúsomeone‚Äôs job got replaced by AI‚Äù because it isn‚Äôt happening at scale, and because if you provide real-world examples, people can actually check. To be clear, some people have lost jobs to AI, just not the white collar workers, software engineers, or really any of the career paths that the mainstream media and AI investors would have you believe. Brian Merchant has done excellent work covering how LLMs have devoured the work of translators, using cheap, ‚Äúalmost good‚Äù automation to lower already-stagnant wages in a field that was already hurting before the advent of generative AI, with some having to abandon the field, and others pushed into bankruptcy. I‚Äôve heard the same for art directors, SEO experts, and copy editors, and Christopher Mims of the Wall Street Journal covered these last year. These are all fields with something in common: shitty bosses with little regard for their customers who have been eagerly waiting for the opportunity to slash contract labor. To quote Merchant, ‚Äúthe drumbeat, marketing, and pop culture of ‚Äòpowerful AI‚Äô encourages and permits management to replace or degrade jobs they might not otherwise have.‚Äù Across the board, the people being ‚Äúreplaced‚Äù by AI are the victims of lazy, incompetent cost-cutters who don‚Äôt care if they ship poorly-translated text. To quote Merchant again, ‚Äú[AI hype] has created the cover necessary to justify slashing rates and accepting ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù automation output for video games and media products.‚Äù Yet the jobs crisis facing translators speaks to the larger flaws of the Large Language Model era, and why other careers aren‚Äôt seeing this kind of disruption. Generative AI creates outputs, and by extension defines all labor as some kind of output created from a request. In the case of translation, it‚Äôs possible for a company to get by with a shitty version, because many customers see translation as ‚Äúwhat do these words say,‚Äù even though (as one worker told Merchant) translation is about conveying meaning. Nevertheless, ‚Äútranslation‚Äù work had already started to condense to a world where humans would at times clean up machine-generated text, and the same worker warned that the same might come for other industries. Yet the problem is that translation is a heavily output-driven industry, one where (idiot) bosses can say ‚Äúoh yeah that‚Äôs fine‚Äù because they ran an output back through Google Translate and it seemed fine in their native tongue. The problems of a poor translation are obvious, but the customers of translation are, it seems, often capable of getting by with a shitty product. The problem is that most jobs are not output-driven at all, and what we‚Äôre buying from a human being is a person‚Äôs ability to think. Every CEO talking about AI replacing workers is an example of the real problem: that most companies are run by people who don‚Äôt understand or experience the problems they‚Äôre solving, don‚Äôt do any real work, don‚Äôt face any real problems, and thus can never be trusted to solve them. The Era of the Business Idiot is the result of letting management consultants and neoliberal ‚Äúfree market‚Äù sociopaths take over everything, leaving us with companies run by people who don‚Äôt know how the companies make money, just that they must always make more. When you‚Äôre a big, stupid asshole, every job that you see is condensed to its outputs, and not the stuff that leads up to the output, or the small nuances and conscious decisions that make an output good as opposed to simply acceptable, or even bad. What does a software engineer do? They write code! What does a writer do? They write words! What does a hairdresser do? They cut hair! Yet that‚Äôs not actually the case. As I‚Äôll get into later, a software engineer does far more than just code, and when they write code they‚Äôre not just saying ‚Äúwhat would solve this problem?‚Äù with a big smile on their face ‚Äî they‚Äôre taking into account their years of experience, what code does, what code could do, all the things that might break as a result, and all of the things that you can‚Äôt really tell from just looking at code, like whether there‚Äôs a reason things are made in a particular way. A good coder doesn‚Äôt just hammer at the keyboard with the aim of doing a particular task. They factor in questions like: How does this functionality fit into the code that‚Äôs already here? Or, if someone has to update this code in the future, how do I make it easy for them to understand what I‚Äôve written and to make changes without breaking a bunch of other stuff? A writer doesn‚Äôt just ‚Äúwrite words.‚Äù They jostle ideas and ideals and emotions and thoughts and facts and feelings into a condensed piece of text, explaining both what‚Äôs happening and why it‚Äôs happening from their perspective, finding nuanced ways to convey large topics, none of which is the result of a single (or many) prompts but the ever-shifting sand of a writer‚Äôs brain. Good writing is a fight between a bunch of different factors: structure, style, intent, audience, and prioritizing the things that you (or your client) care about in the text. It‚Äôs often emotive ‚Äî or at the very least, driven or inspired by a given emotion ‚Äî which is something that an AI simply can‚Äôt replicate in a way that‚Äôs authentic and believable. And a hairdresser doesn‚Äôt just cut hair, but cuts your hair, which may be wiry, dry, oily, long, short, healthy, unhealthy, on a scalp with particular issues, at a time of year when perhaps you want to change length, at a time that fits you, in ‚Äúthe way you like‚Äù which may be impossible to actually write down but they get it just right. And they make conversation, making you feel at ease while they snip and clip away at your tresses, with you having to trust that they‚Äôll get it right. This is the true nature of labor that executives fail to comprehend at scale: that the things we do are not units of work, but extrapolations of experience, emotion, and context that cannot be condensed in written meaning. Business Idiots see our labor as the result of a smart manager saying ‚Äúdo this,‚Äù rather than human ingenuity interpreting both a request and the shit the manager didn‚Äôt say. What does a CEO do? Uhhh, um, well, a Harvard study says they spend 25% of their time on ‚Äúpeople and relationships,‚Äù 25% on ‚Äúfunctional and business unit reviews,‚Äù 16% on ‚Äúorganization and culture,‚Äù and 21% on ‚Äústrategy,‚Äù with a few percent here and there for things like ‚Äúprofessional development.‚Äù That‚Äôs who runs the vast majority of companies: people that describe their work predominantly as ‚Äúlooking at stuff,‚Äù ‚Äútalking to people‚Äù and ‚Äúthinking about what we do next.‚Äù The most highly-paid jobs in the world are impossible to describe, their labor described in a mish-mash of LinkedInspiraton, yet everybody else‚Äôs labor is an output that can be automated. As a result, Large Language Models seem like magic. When you see everything as an outcome ‚Äî an outcome you may or may not understand, and definitely don‚Äôt understand the process behind, let alone care about ‚Äî you kind of already see your workers as LLMs. You create a stratification of the workforce that goes beyond the normal organizational chart, with senior executives ‚Äî those closer to the class level of CEO ‚Äî acting as those who have risen above the doldrums of doing things to the level of ‚Äúdecisionmaking,‚Äù a fuzzy term that can mean everything from ‚Äúmaking nuanced decisions with input from multiple different subject-matter experts‚Äù to, as ServiceNow Bill McDermott did in 2022, ‚Äú[make] it clear to everybody [in a boardroom of other executives], everything you do: AI, AI, AI, AI, AI.‚Äù The same extends to some members of the business and tech media that have, for the most part, gotten by without having to think too hard about the actual things the companies are saying. I realize this sounds a little mean, and I must be clear it doesn‚Äôt mean that these people know nothing, just that it‚Äôs been possible to scoot through the world without thinking too hard about whether or not something is true. When Salesforce said back in 2024 that its ‚ÄúEinstein Trust Layer‚Äù and AI would be ‚Äútransformational for jobs,‚Äù the media dutifully wrote it down and published it without a second thought. It fully trusted Marc Benioff when he said that Agentforce agents would replace human workers, and then again when he said that AI agents are doing ‚Äú30% to 50% of all the work in Salesforce itself,‚Äù even though that‚Äôs an unproven and nakedly ridiculous statement. Salesforce‚Äôs CFO said earlier this year that AI wouldn‚Äôt boost sales growth in 2025. One would think this would change how they‚Äôre covered, or how seriously one takes Marc Benioff. It hasn‚Äôt, because nobody is paying attention. In fact, nobody seems to be doing their job. This is how the core myths of generative AI were built: by executives saying stuff and the media publishing it without thinking too hard. AI is replacing workers! AI is writing entire computer programs! AI is getting exponentially more-powerful! What does ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù mean? That the models are getting better on benchmarks that are rigged in their favor, but because nobody fucking explains it, regular people are regularly told that AI is ‚Äúpowerful.‚Äù The only thing ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù about generative AI is its mythology. The world‚Äôs executives, entirely disconnected from labor and actual production, are doing the only thing they know how to ‚Äî spend a bunch of money and say vague stuff about ‚ÄúAI being the future.‚Äù There are people ‚Äî journalists, investors, and analysts ‚Äî that have built entire careers on filling in the gaps for the powerful as they splurge billions of dollars and repeat with increasing desperation that ‚Äúthe future is here‚Äù as absolutely nothing happens. You‚Äôve likely seen a few ridiculous headlines recently. One of the most recent, and most absurd, is that that OpenAI will pay Oracle $300 billion over four years, closely followed with the claim that NVIDIA will ‚Äúinvest‚Äù ‚Äú$100 billion‚Äù in OpenAI to build 10GW of AI data centers, though the deal is structured in a way that means that OpenAI is paid ‚Äúprogressively as each gigawatt is deployed,‚Äù and OpenAI will be leasing the chips (rather than buying them outright). I must be clear that these deals are intentionally made to continue the myth of generative AI, to pump NVIDIA, and to make sure OpenAI insiders can sell $10.3 billion of shares. OpenAI cannot afford the $300 billion, NVIDIA hasn‚Äôt sent OpenAI a cent and won‚Äôt do so if it can‚Äôt build the data centers, which OpenAI most assuredly can‚Äôt afford to do. NVIDIA needs this myth to continue, because in truth, all of these data centers are being built for demand that doesn‚Äôt exist, or that ‚Äî if it exists ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt necessarily translate into business customers paying huge amounts for access to OpenAI‚Äôs generative AI services. NVIDIA, OpenAI, CoreWeave and other AI-related companies hope that by announcing theoretical billions of dollars (or hundreds of billions of dollars) of these strange, vague and impossible-seeming deals, they can keep pretending that demand is there, because why else would they build all of these data centers, right? That, and the entire stock market rests on NVIDIA‚Äôs back. It accounts for 7% to 8% of the value of the S&P 500, and Jensen Huang needs to keep selling GPUs. I intend to explain later on how all of this works, and how brittle it really is. The intention of these deals is simple: to make you think ‚Äúthis much money can‚Äôt be wrong.‚Äù It can. These people need you to believe this is inevitable, but they are being proven wrong, again and again, and today I‚Äôm going to continue doing so. Underpinning these stories about huge amounts of money and endless opportunity lies a dark secret ‚Äî that none of this is working, and all of this money has been invested in a technology that doesn‚Äôt make much revenue and loves to burn millions or billions or hundreds of billions of dollars. Over half a trillion dollars has gone into an entire industry without a single profitable company developing models or products built on top of models. By my estimates, there is around $44 billion of revenue in generative AI this year (when you add in Anthropic and OpenAI‚Äôs revenues to the pot, along with the other stragglers) and most of that number has been gathered through reporting from outlets like The Information, because none of these companies share their revenues, all of them lose shit tons of money, and their actual revenues are really, really small. Only one member of the Magnificent Seven (outside of NVIDIA) has ever disclosed its AI revenue ‚Äî Microsoft, which stopped reporting in January 2025, when it reported ‚Äú$13 billion in annualized revenue,‚Äù so around $1.083 billion a month. Microsoft is a sales MACHINE. It is built specifically to create or exploit software markets, suffocating competitors by using its scale to drive down prices, and to leverage the ecosystem that it‚Äôs created over the past few decades. $1 billion a month in revenue is chump change for an organization that makes over $27 billion a quarter in PROFITS. Don‚Äôt worry Satya, I‚Äôll come back to you later. ‚ÄúBut Ed, the early days!‚Äù Worry not ‚Äî I‚Äôve got that covered. This is nothing like any other era of tech. There has never been this kind of cash-rush, even in the fiber boom. Over a decade, Amazon spent about one-tenth of the capex that the Magnificent Seven spent in two years on generative AI building AWS ‚Äî something that now powers a vast chunk of the web, and has long been Amazon‚Äôs most profitable business unit. Generative AI is nothing like Uber, with OpenAI and Anthropic‚Äôs true costs coming in at about $159 billion in the past two years, approaching five times Uber‚Äôs $30 billion all-time burn. And that‚Äôs before the bullshit with NVIDIA and Oracle. Microsoft last reported AI revenue in January. It‚Äôs October this week. Why did it stop reporting this number, you think? Is it because the numbers are so good it couldn‚Äôt possibly let people know? As a general rule, publicly traded companies ‚Äî especially those where the leadership are compensated primarily in equity ‚Äî tend to brag about their successes, in part because said bragging boosts the value of the thing that the leadership gets paid in. There‚Äôs no benefit to being shy. Oracle literally made a regulatory filing to boast it had a $30 billion customer, which turned out to be OpenAI, who eventually agreed (publicly) to spend $300 billion in compute over five years. Which is to say that Microsoft clearly doesn‚Äôt have any good news to share, and as I‚Äôll reveal later, they can‚Äôt even get 3% of their 440 million Microsoft 365 subscribers to pay for Microsoft 365 Copilot. If Microsoft can‚Äôt sell this shit, nobody can. Anyway, I‚Äôm nearly done, sorry, you see, I‚Äôm writing this whole thing as if you‚Äôre brand new and walking up to this relatively unprepared, so I need to introduce another company. In 2020, a splinter group jumped off of OpenAI, funded by Amazon and Google to do much the same thing as OpenAI but pretend to be nicer about it until they have to raise from the Middle East. Anthropic has always been better at coding for some reason, and people really like its Claude models. Both OpenAI and Anthropic have become the only two companies in generative AI to make any real progress, either in terms of recognition or in sheer commercial terms, accounting for the majority of the revenue in the AI industry. In a very real sense, the AI industry‚Äôs revenue is OpenAI and Anthropic. In the year where Microsoft recorded $13bn in AI revenues, $10 billion came from OpenAI‚Äôs spending on Microsoft Azure. Anthropic burned $5.3 billion last year ‚Äî with the vast majority of that going towards compute. Outside of these two companies, there‚Äôs barely enough revenue to justify a single data center. Where we sit today is a time of immense tension. Mark Zuckerberg says we‚Äôre in a bubble, Sam Altman says we‚Äôre in a bubble, Alibaba Chairman and billionaire Joe Tsai says we‚Äôre in a bubble, Apollo says we‚Äôre in a bubble, nobody is making money and nobody knows why they‚Äôre actually doing this anymore, just that they must do it immediately. And they have yet to make the case that generative AI warranted any of these expenditures. That was undoubtedly the longest introduction to a newsletter I‚Äôve ever written, and the reason why I took my time was because this post demands a level of foreshadowing and exposition, and because I want to make it make sense to anyone who reads it ‚Äî whether they‚Äôve read my newsletter for years, or whether they‚Äôre only just now investigating their suspicions that generative AI may not be all it‚Äôs cracked up to be. Today I will make the case that generative AI‚Äôs fundamental growth story is flawed, and explain why we‚Äôre in the midst of an egregious bubble. This industry is sold by keeping things vague, and knowing that most people don‚Äôt dig much deeper than a headline, a problem I simply do not have. This industry is effectively in service of two companies ‚Äî OpenAI and NVIDIA ‚Äî who pump headlines out through endless contracts between them and subsidiaries or investments to give the illusion of activity. OpenAI is now, at this point, on the hook for over a trillion dollars, an egregious sum for a company that already forecast billions in losses, with no clear explanation as to how it‚Äôll afford any of this beyond ‚Äúwe need more money‚Äù and the vague hope that there‚Äôs another Softbank or Microsoft waiting in the wings to swoop in and save the day. I‚Äôm going to walk you through where I see this industry today, and why I see no future for it beyond a fiery apocalypse. While everybody (reasonably!) harps on about hallucinations ‚Äî which, to remind you, is when a model authoritatively states something that isn‚Äôt true ‚Äî but the truth is far more complex, and far worse than it seems. You cannot rely on a large language model to do what you want. Even the most highly-tuned models on the most expensive and intricate platform can‚Äôt actually be relied upon to do exactly what you want. A ‚Äúhallucination‚Äù isn‚Äôt just when these models say something that isn‚Äôt true. It‚Äôs when they decide to do something wrong because it seems the most likely thing to do, or when a coding model decides to go on a wild goose chase, failing the user and burning a ton of money in the process. The advent of ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù models ‚Äî those engineered to ‚Äòthink‚Äô through problems in a way reminiscent of a human ‚Äî and the expansion of what people are (trying) to use LLMs for demands that the definition of an AI hallucination be widened, not merely referring to factual errors, but fundamental errors in understanding the user‚Äôs request or intent, or what constitutes a task, in part because these models cannot think and do not know anything. However successful a model might be in generating something good *once*, it will also often generate something bad, or it‚Äôll generate the right thing but in an inefficient and over-verbose fashion. You do not know what you‚Äôre going to get each time, and hallucinations multiply with the complexity of the thing you‚Äôre asking for, or whether a task contains multiple steps (which is a fatal blow to the idea of ‚Äúagents.‚Äù You can add as many levels of intrigue and ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù as you want, but Large Language Models cannot be trusted to do something correctly, or even consistently, every time. Model companies have successfully convinced everybody that the issue is that users are prompting the models wrong, and that people need to be ‚Äútrained to use AI,‚Äù but what they‚Äôre doing is training people to explain away the inconsistencies of Large Language Models, and to assume individual responsibility for what is an innate flaw in how large language models work. Large Language Models are also uniquely expensive. Many mistakenly try and claim this is like the dot com boom or Uber, but the basic unit economics of generative AI are insane. Providers must purchase tens or hundreds of thousands of GPUs each costing $50,000 a piece, and hundreds of millions or billions of dollars of infrastructure for large clusters. And that‚Äôs without mentioning things like staffing, construction, power, or water. Then you turn them on and start losing money. Despite hundreds of billions of GPUs sold, nobody seems to make any money, other than NVIDIA, the company that makes them, and resellers like Dell and Supermicro who buy the GPUs, put them in servers, and sell them to other people. This arrangement works out great for Jensen Huang, and terribly for everybody else. I am going to explain the insanity of the situation we find ourselves in, and why I continue to do this work undeterred. The bubble has entered its most pornographic, aggressive and destructive stage, where the more obvious it becomes that they‚Äôre cooked, the more ridiculous the generative AI industry will act ‚Äî a dark juxtaposition against every new study that says ‚Äúgenerative AI does not work‚Äù or new story about ChatGPT‚Äôs uncanny ability to activate mental illness in people. So, let‚Äôs start simple: NVIDIA is a hardware company that sells GPUs, including the consumer GPUs that you‚Äôd see in a modern gaming PC, but when you read someone say ‚ÄúGPU‚Äù within the context of AI, they mean enterprise-focused GPUs like the A100, H100, H200, and more modern GPUs like the Blackwell-series B200 and GB200 (which combines two GPUs with an NVIDIA CPU). These GPUs cost anywhere from $30,000 to $50,000 (or as high as $70,000 for the newer Blackwell GPUs), and require tens of thousands of dollars more of infrastructure ‚Äî networking to ‚Äúcluster‚Äù server racks of GPUs together to provide compute, and massive cooling systems to deal with the massive amounts of heat they produce, as well as the servers themselves that they run on, which typically use top-of-the-line data center CPUs, and contain vast quantities of high-speed memory and storage. While the GPU itself is likely the most expensive single item within an AI server, the other costs ‚Äî and I‚Äôm not even factoring in the actual physical building that the server lives in, or the water or electricity that it uses ‚Äî add up. I‚Äôve mentioned NVIDIA because it has a virtual monopoly in this space. Generative AI effectively requires NVIDIA GPUs, in part because it‚Äôs the only company really making the kinds of high-powered cards that generative AI demands, and because NVIDIA created something called CUDA ‚Äî a collection of software tools that lets programmers write software that runs on GPUs, which were traditionally used primarily for rendering graphics in games. While there are open-source alternatives, as well as alternatives from Intel (with its ARC GPUs) and AMD (Nvidia‚Äôs main rival in the consumer space), these aren‚Äôt nearly as mature or feature-rich. Due to the complexities of AI models, one cannot just stand up a few of these things either ‚Äî you need clusters of thousands, tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of them for it to be worthwhile, making any investment in GPUs in the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars, especially considering they require completely different data center architecture to make them run. A common request ‚Äî like asking a generative AI model to parse through thousands of lines of code and make a change or an addition ‚Äî may use multiple of these $50,000 GPUs at the same time, and so if you aspire to serve thousands, or millions of concurrent users, you need to spend big. Really big. It‚Äôs these factors ‚Äî the vendor lock-in, the ecosystem, and the fact that generative AI only works when you‚Äôre buying GPUs at scale ‚Äî that underpin the rise of Nvidia. But beyond the economic and technical factors, there are human ones, too. To understand the AI bubble is to understand why CEOs do the things they do. Because an executive‚Äôs job is so vague, they can telegraph the value of their ‚Äúlabor‚Äù by spending money on initiatives and making partnerships. AI gave hyperscalers the excuse to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers and buy a bunch of GPUs to go in them, because that, to the markets, looks like they‚Äôre doing something. By virtue of spending a lot of money in a frighteningly short amount of time, Satya Nadella received multiple glossy profiles, all without having to prove that AI can really do anything, be it a job or make Microsoft money. Nevertheless, AI allowed CEOs to look busy, and once the markets and journalists had agreed on the consensus opinion that ‚ÄúAI would be big,‚Äù all that these executives had to do was buy GPUs and ‚Äúdo AI.‚Äù We are in the midst of one of the darkest forms of software in history, described by many as an unwanted guest invading their products, their social media feeds, their bosses‚Äô empty minds, and resting in the hands of monsters. Every story of its success feels bereft of any real triumph, with every literal description of its abilities involving multiple caveats about the mistakes it makes or the incredible costs of running it. Generative AI exists for two reasons: to cost money, and to make executives look busy. It was meant to be the new enterprise software and the new iPhone and the new Netflix all at once, a panacea where software guys pay one hardware guy for GPUs to unlock the incredible value creation of the future. Generative AI was always set up to fail, because it was meant to be everything, was talked about like it was everything, is still sold like it‚Äôs everything, yet for all the fucking hype, it all comes down to two companies: OpenAI, and, of course, NVIDIA. NVIDIA was, for a while, living high on the hog. All CEO Jensen Huang had to do every three months was saying ‚Äúcheck out these numbers‚Äù and the markets and business journalists would squeal with glee, even as he said stuff like ‚Äúthe more you buy the more you save,‚Äù in part tipping his head to the (very real and sensible) idea of accelerated computing, but framed within the context of the cash inferno that‚Äôs generative AI, seems ludicrous. Huang‚Äôs showmanship worked really well for NVIDIA for a while, because for a while the growth was easy. Everybody was buying GPUs. Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Google (and to a lesser extent Apple and Tesla) make up 42% of NVIDIA‚Äôs revenue, creating, at least for the first four, a degree of shared mania where everybody justified buying tens of billions of dollars of GPUs a year by saying ‚Äúthe other guy is doing it!‚Äù This is one of the major reasons the AI bubble is happening, because people conflated NVIDIA‚Äôs incredible sales with ‚Äúinterest in AI,‚Äù rather than everybody buying GPUs. Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll explain the revenue side a little bit later. We‚Äôre here for the long haul. Anyway, NVIDIA is facing a problem ‚Äî that the only thing that grows forever is cancer. On September 9 2025, the Wall Street Journal said that NVIDIA‚Äôs ‚Äúwow‚Äù factor was fading, going from beating analyst estimates in by nearly 21% in its Fiscal Year Q2 2024 earnings to scraping by with a mere 1.52% beat in its most-recent earnings ‚Äî something that for any other company, would be a good thing, but framed against the delusional expectations that generative AI has inspired, is a figure that looks nothing short of ominous. Per the Wall Street Journal: In any other scenario, 56% year-over-year growth would lead to an abundance of Dom Perignon and Huang signing hundreds of boobs, but this is NVIDIA, and that‚Äôs just not good enough. Back in February 2024, NVIDIA was booking 265% year-over-year growth, but in its February 2025 earnings, NVIDIA only grew by a measly 78% year-over-year. It isn‚Äôt so much that NVIDIA isn‚Äôt growing, but that to grow year-over-year at the rates that people expect is insane. Life was a lot easier when NVIDIA went from $6.05 billion in revenue in Q4 FY2023 to $22 billion in revenue in Q4 FY2024, but for it to grow even 55% year-over-year from Q2 FY2026 ($46.7 billion) to Q2 2027 would require it to make $72.385 billion in revenue in the space of three months, mostly from selling GPUs (which make up around 88% of its revenue). This would put Nvidia in the ballpark of Microsoft ($76 billion in the last quarter) and within the neighborhood of Apple ($94 billion in the last quarter), predominantly making money in an industry that a year-and-a-half ago barely made the company $6 billion in a quarter. And the market needs NVIDIA to perform, as the company makes up 8% of the value of the S&P 500. It‚Äôs not enough for it to be wildly profitable, or have a monopsony on selling GPUs, or for it to have effectively 10x‚Äôd their stock in a few years. It must continue to grow at the fastest rate of anything ever, making more and more money selling these GPUs to a small group of companies that immediately start losing money once they plug them in. While a few members of the Magnificent Seven could be depended on to funnel tens of billions of dollars into a furnace each quarter, there were limits, even for companies like Microsoft, which had bought over 485,000 GPUs in 2024 alone. To take a step back, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon make their money by either selling access to Large Language Models that people incorporate into their products, or by renting out servers full of GPUs to run inference (as said previously, the process to generate an output by a model or series of models) or train AI models for companies that develop and market models themselves, namely Anthropic and OpenAI. The latter revenue stream of which is where Jensen Huang found a solution to that eternal growth problem: the neocloud, namely CoreWeave, Lambda and Nebius. These businesses are fairly straightforward. They own (or lease) data centers that they then fill full of servers that are full of NVIDIA GPUs, which they then rent on an hourly basis to customers, either on a per-GPU basis or in large batches for larger customers, who guarantee they'll use a certain amount of compute and sign up to long-term (i.e. more than an hour at a time) commitments. A neocloud is a specialist cloud compute company that exists only to provide access to GPUs for AI, unlike Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, all of which have healthy businesses selling other kinds of compute, with AI (as I‚Äôll get into later) failing to provide much of a return on investment. It‚Äôs not just the fact that these companies are more specialized than, say, Amazon‚Äôs AWS or Microsoft Azure. As you‚Äôve gathered from the name, these are new, young, and in almost all cases, incredibly precarious businesses ‚Äî each with financial circumstances that would make a Greek finance minister blush. That‚Äôs because setting up a neocloud is expensive. Even if the company in question already has data centers ‚Äî as CoreWeave did with its cryptocurrency mining operation ‚Äî AI requires completely new data center infrastructure to house and cool the GPUs, and those GPUs also need paying for, and then there‚Äôs the other stuff I mentioned earlier, like power, water, and the other bits of the computer (the CPU, the motherboard, the memory and storage, and the housing). As a result, these neoclouds are forced to raise billions of dollars in debt, which they collateralize using the GPUs they already have, along with contracts from customers, which they use to buy more GPUs. CoreWeave, for example, has $25 billion in debt on estimated revenues of $5.35 billion, losing hundreds of millions of dollars a quarter. You know who also invests in these neoclouds? NVIDIA! NVIDIA is also one of CoreWeave‚Äôs largest customers (accounting for 15% of its revenue in 2024), and just signed a deal to buy $6.3 billion of any capacity that CoreWeave can‚Äôt otherwise sell to someone else through 2032, an extension of a $1.3 billion 2023 deal reported by the Information. It was the anchor investor ($250 million) in CoreWeave‚Äôs IPO, too. NVIDIA is currently doing the same thing with Lambda, another neocloud that NVIDIA invested in, which also plans to go public next year. NVIDIA is also one of Lambda‚Äôs largest customers, signing a deal with it this summer to rent 10,000 GPUs for $1.3 billion over four years. In the UK, NVIDIA has just invested $700 million in Nscale, a former crypto miner that has never built an AI data center, and that has, despite having no experience, committed $1 billion (and/or 100,000 GPUs) to an OpenAI data center in Norway. On Thursday, September 25, Nscale announced it had closed another funding round, with NVIDIA listed as a main backer ‚Äî although it‚Äôs unclear how much money it put in. It would be safe to assume it‚Äôs another few hundred million. NVIDIA also invested in Nebius, an outgrowth of Russian conglomerate Yandex, and Nebius provides, through a partnership with NVIDIA, tens of thousands of dollars‚Äô worth of compute credits to companies in NVIDIA‚Äôs Inception startup program. NVIDIA‚Äôs plan is simple: fund these neoclouds, let these neoclouds load themselves up with debt, at which point they buy GPUs from NVIDIA, which can then be used as collateral for loans, along with contracts from customers, allowing the neoclouds to buy even more GPUs. It‚Äôs like that Robinhood infinite money glitch‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶except, that is, for one small problem. There don‚Äôt appear to be that many customers. As I went into recently on my premium newsletter, NVIDIA funds and sustains Neoclouds as a way of funnelling revenue to itself, as well as partners like Supermicro and Dell, resellers that take NVIDIA GPUs and put them in servers to sell pre-built to customers. These two companies made up 39% of NVIDIA‚Äôs revenues last quarter. Yet when you remove hyperscaler revenue ‚Äî Microsoft, Amazon, Google, OpenAI and NVIDIA ‚Äî from the revenues of these neoclouds, there‚Äôs barely $1 billion in revenue combined, across CoreWeave, Nebius and Lambda. CoreWeave‚Äôs $5.35 billion revenue is predominantly made up of its contracts with NVIDIA, Microsoft (offering compute for OpenAI), Google (hiring CoreWeave to offer compute for OpenAI), and OpenAI itself, which has promised CoreWeave $22.4 billion in business over the next few years. This is all a lot of stuff, so I‚Äôll make it really simple: there is no real money in offering AI compute, but that isn‚Äôt Jensen Huang‚Äôs problem, so he will simply force NVIDIA to hand money to these companies so that they have contracts to point to when they raise debt to buy more NVIDIA GPUs. Neoclouds are effectively giant private equity vehicles that exist to raise money to buy GPUs from NVIDIA, or for hyperscalers to move money around so that they don‚Äôt increase their capital expenditures and can, as Microsoft did earlier in the year, simply walk away from deals they don‚Äôt like. Nebius‚Äô ‚Äú$17.4 billion deal‚Äù with Microsoft even included a clause in its 6-K filing that Microsoft can terminate the deal in the event the capacity isn‚Äôt built by the delivery dates, and Nebius has already used the contract to raise $3 billion to‚Ä¶ build the data center to provide compute for the contract. Here, let me break down the numbers: From my analysis, it appears that CoreWeave, despite expectations to make that $5.35 billion this year, has only around $500 million of non-Magnificent Seven or OpenAI AI revenue in 2025, with Lambda estimated to have around $100 million in AI revenue, and Nebius around $250 million without Microsoft‚Äôs share, and that‚Äôs being generous. In simpler terms, the Magnificent Seven is the AI bubble, and the AI bubble exists to buy more GPUs, because (as I‚Äôll show) there‚Äôs no real money or growth coming out of this, other than in the amount that private credit is investing ‚Äî ‚Äú$50 billion a quarter, for the low end, for the past three quarters.‚Äù I dunno man, let‚Äôs start simple: $50 billion a quarter of data center funding is going into an industry that has less revenue than Genshin Impact. That feels pretty bad. Who‚Äôs gonna use these data centers? How are they going to even make money on them? Private equity firms don‚Äôt typically hold onto assets, they sell them or take them public. Doesn‚Äôt seem great to me! Anyway, if AI was truly the next big growth vehicle, neoclouds would be swimming in diverse global revenue streams. Instead, they‚Äôre heavily-centralized around the same few names, one of which (NVIDIA) directly benefits from their existence not as a company doing business, but as an entity that can accrue debt and spend money on GPUs. These Neoclouds are entirely dependent on a continual flow of private credit from firms like Goldman Sachs (Nebius, CoreWeave, Lambda for its IPO), JPMorgan (Lambda, Crusoe, CoreWeave), and Blackstone (Lambda, CoreWeave), who have in a very real sense created an entire debt-based infrastructure to feed billions of dollars directly to NVIDIA, all in the name of an AI revolution that's yet to arrive. The fact that the rest of the neocloud revenue stream is effectively either a hyperscaler or OpenAI is also concerning. Hyperscalers are, at this point, the majority of data center capital expenditures, and have yet to prove any kind of success from building out this capacity, outside, of course, Microsoft‚Äôs investment in OpenAI, which has succeeded in generating revenue while burning billions of dollars. Hyperscaler revenue is also capricious, but even if it isn‚Äôt, why are there no other major customers? Why, across all of these companies, does there not seem to be one major customer who isn‚Äôt OpenAI? The answer is obvious: nobody that wants it can afford it, and those who can afford it don‚Äôt need it. It‚Äôs also unclear what exactly hyperscalers are doing with this compute, because it sure isn‚Äôt ‚Äúmaking money.‚Äù While Microsoft makes $10 billion in revenue from renting compute to OpenAI via Microsoft Azure, it does so at-cost, and was charging OpenAI $1.30-per-hour for each A100GPU it rents, a loss of $2.2 an hour per GPU, meaning that it is likely losing money on this compute, especially as SemiAnalysis has the total cost per hour per GPU at around $1.46 with the cost of capital and debt associated for a hyperscaler, though it‚Äôs unclear if that‚Äôs for an H100 or A100 GPU. In any case, how do these neoclouds pay for their debt if the hyperscalers give up, or NVIDIA doesn‚Äôt send them money, or, more likely, private credit begins to notice that there‚Äôs no real revenue growth outside of circular compute deals with neoclouds‚Äô largest supplier, investor and customer? They don‚Äôt! In fact, I have serious concerns that they can‚Äôt even build the capacity necessary to fulfil these deals, but nobody seems to worry about that. No, really! It appears to be taking Oracle and Crusoe around 2.5 years per gigawatt of compute capacity. How exactly are any of these neoclouds (or Oracle itself) able to expand to actually capture this revenue? Who knows! But I assume somebody is going to say ‚ÄúOpenAI!‚Äù Here‚Äôs an insane statistic for you: OpenAI will account for ‚Äî in both its own revenue (projected $13 billion) and in its own compute costs ($16 billion, according to The Information, although that figure is likely out of date, and seemingly only includes the compute it‚Äôll use, and not that it has committed to build, and thus has spent money on) ‚Äî about 50% of all AI revenues in 2025. That figure takes into account the $400m ARR for ServiceNow, Adobe, and Salesforce; the $35bn in revenue for the Magnificent Seven from AI (not profit, and based on figures from the previous year); revenue from neoclouds like CoreWeave, Nebius, and Lambda; and the estimated revenue from the entire generative AI industry (including Anthropic and other smaller players, like Perplexity and Anysphere) for a total of $55bn.OpenAI is the generative AI industry ‚Äî and it‚Äôs a dog of a company. As a reminder, OpenAI has leaked that it‚Äôll burn $115 billion in the next four years, and based on my estimates, it needs to raise more than $290 billion in the next four years based on its $300 billion deal with Oracle alone. That alone is a very, very bad sign, especially as we‚Äôre three years and $500 billion or more into this hype cycle with few signs of life outside of, well, OpenAI promising people money. Credit to Anthony Restaino for this horrifying graphic: This is not what a healthy, stable industry looks like. Alright, well, things can‚Äôt be that bad on the software side. Right? Right? As I covered on my premium newsletter a few weeks ago, everybody is losing money on generative AI, in part because the cost of running AI models is increasing, and in part because the software itself doesn‚Äôt do enough to warrant the costs associated with running them, which are already subsidized and unprofitable for the model providers. Outside of OpenAI (and to a lesser extent Anthropic), nobody seems to be making much revenue, with the most ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù company being Anysphere, makers of AI coding tool Cursor, which hit $500 million ‚Äòannualized‚Äù (so $41.6 million in one month) a few months ago, just before Anthropic and OpenAI jacked up the prices for ‚Äúpriority processing‚Äù on enterprise queries, raising its operating costs as a result. In any case, that‚Äôs some piss-poor revenue for an industry that‚Äôs meant to be the future of software. Smartwatches are projected to make $32 billion this year, and as mentioned, the Magnificent Seven expects to make $35 billion or so in revenue from AI this year. Even Anthropic and OpenAI seem a little lethargic, both burning billions of dollars while making, by my estimates, no more than $2 billion and $6.26 billion in 2025 so far, despite projections of $5 billion and $13 billion respectively. Outside of these two, AI startups are floundering, struggling to stay alive and raising money in several-hundred million dollar bursts as their negative-gross-margin businesses flounder. As I dug into a few months ago, I could find only 12 AI-powered companies making more than $8.3 million a month, with two of them slightly improving their revenues, specifically AI search company Perplexity (which has now hit $150 million ARR, or $12.5 million in a month) and AI coding startup Replit (which also hit $150 million ARR in September). Both of these companies burn ridiculous amounts of money. Perplexity burned 164% of its revenue on Amazon Web Services, OpenAI and Anthropic last year, and while Replit hasn‚Äôt leaked its costs, The Information reports its gross margins in July were 23%, which doesn‚Äôt include the costs of its free users, which you simply have to do with LLMs as free users are capable of costing you a hell of a lot of money. Problematically, your paid users can also cost you more than they bring in as well. In fact, every user loses you money in generative AI, because it‚Äôs impossible to do cost control in a consistent manner. A few months ago, I did a piece about Anthropic losing money on every single Claude Code subscriber, and I‚Äôll walk you through it in a very simplified fashion: Anthropic is, to be clear, the second-largest model developer, and has some of the best AI talent in the industry. It has a better handle on its infrastructure than anyone outside of big tech and OpenAI. It still cannot seem to fix this problem, even with weekly rate limits. While one could assume that Anthropic is simply letting people run wild, my theory is far simpler: even the model developers have no real way of limiting user activity, likely due to the architecture of generative AI. I know it sounds insane, but at the most advanced level, model providers are still prompting their models, and whatever rate limits may be in place appear to, at times, get completely ignored, and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be anything they can do to stop it. No, really. Anthropic counts amongst its capitalist apex predators one lone Chinese man who spent $50,000 of their compute in the space of a month fucking around with Claude Code. Even if Anthropic was profitable ‚Äî it isn‚Äôt, and will burn billions this year ‚Äî a customer paying $200-a-month running up $50,000 in costs immediately devours the margin of any user running the service that day, if not that week or month. Even if Anthropic‚Äôs costs are half the published rates, one guy amounted to 125 users‚Äô monthly revenue. That‚Äôs not a real business! That‚Äôs a bad business with out-of-control costs, and it doesn‚Äôt appear anybody has these costs under control. A few weeks ago, Replit ‚Äî an unprofitable AI coding company ‚Äî released a product called ‚ÄúAgent 3.‚Äù which promised to be ‚Äú10x more autonomous‚Äù and offer ‚Äúinfinitely more possibilities,‚Äù ‚Äú[testing] and [fixing] its code, constantly improving your application behind the scenes in a reflection loop.‚Äù In reality, this means you‚Äôd go and tell the model to build something and it would ‚Äúgo do it,‚Äù and you‚Äôll be shocked to hear that these models can‚Äôt be relied upon to ‚Äúgo and do‚Äù anything. Please note that this was launched a few months after Replit raised its prices, shifting to obfuscated ‚Äúeffort-based‚Äù pricing that would charge ‚Äúthe full scope of the agent‚Äôs work.‚Äù Agent 3 has been a disaster. Users found tasks that previously cost a few dollars were spiralling into the hundreds of dollars, with The Register reporting one customer found themselves with a $1000 bill after a week: Another user complained that ‚Äúcosts skyrocketed, without any concrete results‚Äù: As I previously reported, in late May/early June, both OpenAI and Anthropic cranked up the pricing on their enterprise customers, leading to Replit and Cursor both shifting their prices. This abuse has now trickled down to their customers. Replit has now released an update that lets you choose how autonomous you want Agent 3 to be, which is a tacit admission that you can‚Äôt trust coding LLMs to build software. Replit‚Äôs users are still pissed off, complaining that Replit is charging them for activity when the agent doesn‚Äôt do anything, a consistent problem across its Reddit. While Reddit is not the full summation of all users across every company, it‚Äôs a fairly good barometer of user sentiment, and man, are users pissy. Traditionally, Silicon Valley startups have relied upon the same model of ‚Äúgrow really fast and burn a bunch of money, then ‚Äúturn the profit lever.‚Äù AI does not have a ‚Äúprofit lever,‚Äù because the raw costs of providing access to AI models are so high (and they‚Äôre only increasing) that the basic economics of how the tech industry sells software don‚Äôt make sense. I‚Äôll reiterate something I wrote a few weeks ago: In simpler terms, it is very, very difficult to imagine what one user ‚Äî free or otherwise ‚Äî might cost, and thus it‚Äôs hard to charge them on a monthly basis, or tell them what a service might cost them on average. This is a huge problem with AI coding environments. According to The Information, Claude Code was driving ‚Äúnearly $400 million in annualized revenue, roughly doubling from a few weeks ago‚Äù on July 31 2025. That annualized revenue works out to about $33 million a month in revenue for a company that predicts it will make at least $416 million a month by the end of the year, and for a product that has become the most-popular coding environment in the world, from the second-largest and best-funded AI company in the world. ‚Ä¶is that it? Is that all that‚Äôs happening here? $33 million dollars, all of it unprofitable, after it felt, at least based on social media chatter and discussing with multiple different software engineers, that Claude Code had become ubiquitous with anything to do with LLMs. To be clear, Anthropic‚Äôs Sonnet and Opus models are consistently some of the most popular for programming on Openrouter, an aggregator of LLM usage, and Anthropic has been consistently-named as ‚Äúthe best at coding.‚Äù Some bright spark out there is going to say that Microsoft‚Äôs Github Copilot has 1.8 million paying subscribers, and guess what, that‚Äôs true, and in fact, I reported it! Here‚Äôs another fun fact: the Wall Street Journal reported that Microsoft loses ‚Äúon average more than $20-a-month-per-user,‚Äù with ‚Äú...some users [costing] the company as much as $80.‚Äù And that‚Äôs for the most-popular product! If you believe the New York Times or other outlets that simply copy and paste whatever Dario Amodei says, you‚Äôd think that the reason that software engineers are having trouble finding work is because their jobs are being replaced by AI. This grotesque, abusive, manipulative and offensive lie has been propagated throughout the entire business and tech media without anybody sitting down and asking whether it‚Äôs true, or even getting a good understanding of what it is that LLMs can actually do with code. Members of the media, I am begging you, stop doing this. I get it, every asshole is willing to give a quote saying that ‚Äúcoding is dead,‚Äù and that every executive is willing to burp out some nonsense about replacing all of their engineers, but I am fucking begging you to either use these things yourself, or speak to people that do. I am not a coder. I cannot write or read code. Nevertheless, I am capable of learning, and have spoken to numerous software engineers in the last few months, and basically reached a consensus of ‚Äúthis is kind of useful, sometimes.‚Äù However, one very silly man once said that I don‚Äôt speak to people who use these tools, so I went and spoke to three notable, experienced software engineers, and asked them to give me the straight truth about what coding LLMs can do. In simple terms, LLMs are capable of writing code, but can‚Äôt do software engineering, because software engineering is the process of understanding, maintaining and executing code to produce functional software, and LLMs do not ‚Äúlearn,‚Äù cannot ‚Äúadapt,‚Äù and (to paraphrase Brown), break down the more of your code and variables you ask them to look at at once. It‚Äôs very easy to believe that software engineering is just writing code, but the reality is that software engineers maintain software, which includes writing and analyzing code among a vast array of different personalities and programs and problems. Good software engineering harkens back to Brian Merchant‚Äôs interviews with translators ‚Äî while some may believe that translators simply tell you what words mean, true translation is communicating the meaning of a sentence, which is cultural, contextual, regional, and personal, and often requires the exercise of creativity and novel thinking. My editor, Matthew Hughes, gave an example of this in his newsletter: Similarly, coding is not just ‚Äúa series of text that programs a computer,‚Äù but a series of interconnected characters that refers to other software in other places that must also function now and explain, on some level, to someone who has never, ever seen the code before, why it was done this way. This is, by the way, why we are still yet to get any tangible proof that AI is replacing software engineers‚Ä¶because it can‚Äôt. Of all the fields supposedly at risk from ‚ÄúAI disruption,‚Äù coding feels (or felt) the most tangible, if only because the answer to ‚Äúcan you write code with LLMs‚Äù wasn‚Äôt an immediate, unilateral no. The media has also been quick to say that AI ‚Äúwrites software,‚Äù which is true in the same way that ChatGPT ‚Äúwrites novels‚Äù. In reality, LLMs can generate code, and do some software engineering-adjacent tasks, but, like all Large Language Models, break down and go totally insane, hallucinating more as the tasks get more complex. And, as I pointed out earlier, software engineering is not just coding. It involves thinking about problems, finding solutions to novel challenges, designing stuff in a way that can be read and maintained by others, and that‚Äôs (ideally) scalable and secure. The whole fucking point of an ‚ÄúAI‚Äù is that you hand shit off to it! That‚Äôs what they‚Äôve been selling it as! That‚Äôs why Jensen Huang told kids to stop learning to code, as with AI, there‚Äôs no point. And it was all a lie. Generative AI can‚Äôt do the job of a software engineer, and it fails while also costing abominable amounts of money. Coding LLMs seem like magic at first, because they (to quote a conversation with Carl Brown) make the easy things easier, but they also make the harder things harder. They don‚Äôt even speed up engineers ‚Äî they actually make them slower! Yet coding is basically the only obvious use case for LLMs. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre gonna say ‚Äúbut I bet the enterprise is doing well!‚Äù and you are so very, very wrong. Before I go any further, let‚Äôs establish some facts: All of this is to say that Microsoft has one of the largest commercial software empires in history, thousands (if not tens of thousands) of salespeople, and thousands of companies that literally sell Microsoft services for a living. And it can‚Äôt sell AI. A source that has seen materials related to sales has confirmed that, as of August 2025, Microsoft has around eight million active licensed users of Microsoft 365 Copilot, amounting to a 1.81% conversion rate across the 440 million Microsoft 365 subscribers. This would amount to, if each of these users paid annually at the full rate of $30-a-month, to about $2.88 billion in annual revenue for a product category that makes $33 billion a fucking quarter. And I must be clear, I am 100% sure these users aren‚Äôt all paying $30 a month. The Information reported a few weeks ago that Microsoft has been ‚Äúreducing the software‚Äôs price with more generous discounts on the AI features, according to customers and salespeople,‚Äù heavily suggesting discounts had already been happening. Enterprise software is traditionally sold at a discount anyway ‚Äî or, put a different way, with bulk pricing for those who sign up a bunch of users at once. In fact, I‚Äôve found evidence that it‚Äôs been doing this a while, with a 15% discount on annual Microsoft 365 Copilot subscriptions for orders of 10-to-300 seats mentioned by an IT consultant back in late 2024, and another that‚Äôs currently running through September 30, 2025 through Microsoft‚Äôs Cloud Solution Provider program, with up to 2400 licenses discounted if you pay upfront for the year. Microsoft seems to do this a lot, as I found another example of an offer that ran from January 1 2025 through March 31 2025. An ‚Äúactive‚Äù user is someone who has taken one action on Copilot in any Microsoft 365 app in the space of 28 days. Now, I know. That word, active. Maybe you‚Äôre thinking ‚ÄúEd, this is like the gym model! There are unpaid licenses that Microsoft is getting paid for!‚Äù Fine! Let‚Äôs assume that Microsoft also has, based on research that suggests this is the case for all software companies, another 50% ‚Äî four million ‚Äî of paid Copilot licenses that aren‚Äôt being used. That still makes this 12 million users, which is still a putrid 2.72% conversion rate. So, why aren‚Äôt people paying for Copilot? Let‚Äôs hear from someone who talked to The Information: Microsoft 365 Copilot has been such a disaster that Microsoft will now integrate Anthropic‚Äôs models in an attempt and make them better. Oh, one other thing: sources also confirm GPU utilization for Microsoft 365‚Äôs enterprise Copilot is barely scratching 60%. I‚Äôm also hearing that less than SharePoint ‚Äî another popular enterprise app from Microsoft with 250 million users ‚Äî had less than 300,000 weekly active users of its AI copilot features in August. So, The Information reported a few months ago that Microsoft‚Äôs projected AI revenues would be $13 billion, with $10 billion of that from OpenAI, leaving about $3 billion of total revenue across Microsoft 365 Copilot and any other foreseeable feature that Microsoft sells with ‚ÄúAI‚Äù on it. This heavily suggests that Microsoft is making somewhere between $1.5 billion and $2 billion on Azure or Microsoft 365 Copilot, though I suppose there are other places it could be making AI revenue too. Right? I guess. In any case, Microsoft‚Äôs net income (read: profit) in its last quarterly earnings was $27.2 billion. Pathetic. One of the comfortable lies that people tell themselves is that the AI bubble is similar to the fiber boom, or the dot com bubble, or Uber, or that we‚Äôre in the ‚Äúgrowth stage,‚Äù or that ‚Äúthis is what software companies do, they spend a bunch of money then ‚Äúpull the profit lever.‚Äù This is nothing like anything you‚Äôve seen before, because this is the dumbest shit that the tech industry has ever done. AI data centers are nothing like fiber, because there are very few actual use cases for these GPUs outside of AI, and none of them are remotely hyperscale revenue drivers. As I discussed a month or so ago, data center development accounted for more of America‚Äôs GDP growth than all consumer spending combined, and there really isn‚Äôt any demand for AI in general, let alone at the scale that these hundreds of billions of dollars are being sunk into. The conservative estimate of capital expenditures related to data centers is around $400 billion, but given the $50 billion a quarter in private credit, I‚Äôm going to guess it breaks $500 billion, all to build capacity for an industry yet to prove itself. And this NVIDIA-OpenAI ‚Äú$100 billion funding‚Äù news should only fill you full of dread, but also it isn‚Äôt fucking finalized, stop reporting it as if it‚Äôs done, I swear to god- Anyway, according to CNBC, ‚Äúthe initial $10 billion tranche is locked in at a $500 billion valuation and expected to close within a month or so once the transaction has been finalized,‚Äù with ‚Äúsuccessive $10 billion rounds are planned, each to be priced at the company‚Äôs then-current valuation as new capacity comes online.‚Äù At no point is anyone asking how, exactly, OpenAI builds data centers to fill full of these GPUs. In fact, I am genuinely shocked (and a little disgusted!) by how poorly this story has been told. Let‚Äôs go point by point: To be clear, when I say OpenAI needs at least $300 billion over the next four years, that‚Äôs if you believe its projections, which you shouldn‚Äôt. Let‚Äôs walk through its (alleged) numbers, while plagiarizing myself: According to The Information, here's the breakdown (these are projections): OpenAI's current reported burn is $116 billion through 2030, which means there is no way that these projections include $300 billion in compute costs, even when you factor in revenue. There is simply no space in these projections to absorb that $300 billion, and from what I can tell, by 2029, OpenAI will have actually burned more than $290 billion, assuming that it survives that long, which I do not believe it will. Don‚Äôt worry, though. OpenAI is about to make some crazy money. Here are the projections that CFO Sarah Friar signed off on: Just so we are clear, OpenAI intends to 10x its revenue in the space of four years, selling software and access to models in an industry with about $60 billion of revenue in 2025. How will it do this? It doesn‚Äôt say. I don‚Äôt know OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar, but I do know that signing off on these numbers is, at the very least, ethically questionable. Putting aside the ridiculousness of OpenAI‚Äôs deals, or its funding requirements, Friar has willfully allowed Sam Altman and OpenAI to state goals that defy reality or good sense, all to take advantage of investors and public markets that have completely lost the plot. I need to be blunter: OpenAI has signed multiple different deals and contracts for amounts it cannot afford to pay, that it cannot hope to raise the money to pay for, that defy the amounts of venture capital and private credit available, all to sustain a company that will burn $300 billion and has no path to profitability of any kind. So, as I said above, CNBC reported on September 23, 2025 that the NVIDIA deal will be delivered in $10 billion tranches, the first of which is ‚Äúexpected to close within a month,‚Äù and the rest delivered ‚Äúas new capacity comes online.‚Äù This is, apparently, all part of a plan to build 10GW of data center capacity with NVIDIA. A few key points: So, let‚Äôs start simple: data centers take forever to build. As I said previously, based on current reports, it‚Äôs taking Oracle and Crusoe around 2.5 years per gigawatt of data center capacity, and nowhere in these reports does one reporter take a second to say ‚Äúhey, what data centers are you talking about?‚Äù or ‚Äúhey, didn‚Äôt Sam Altman say back in July that he was building 10GW of data center capacity with Oracle?‚Äù But wait, now Oracle and OpenAI have done another announcement that says they‚Äôre only doing 7GW, but they‚Äôre ‚Äúahead of schedule‚Äù on 10GW? Wait, is NVIDIA‚Äôs 10GW the same 10GW as Oracle and OpenAI are working on? Is it different? Nobody seems to know or care! Anyway, I cannot be clear enough how unlikely it is that (as NVIDIA has said) ‚Äúthe first gigawatt of NVIDIA systems will be deployed in the second half of 2026,‚Äù and that‚Äôs if it has bought the land and got the permits and ordered the construction, none of which has happened yet. But let‚Äôs get really specific on costs! Crusoe‚Äôs 1.2GW of compute for OpenAI is a $15 billion joint venture, which means a gigawatt of compute runs about $12.5 billion. Abilene‚Äôs eight buildings are meant to hold 50,000 NVIDIA GB200 GPUs and their associated networking infrastructure, so let‚Äôs say a gigawatt is around 333,333 Blackwell GPUs. Though this math is a little funky due to NVIDIA promising to install its new Rubin GPUs in these theoretical data centers, that means these data centers will require a little under $200 billion worth of GPUs. By my maths that‚Äôs $325 billion. I‚Äôm so tired of this. A number of you have sent me the following image with some sort of comment about how ‚Äúthis is how it‚Äôll work,‚Äù and you are wrong, because this is neither how it works nor how it will work nor accurate on any level. In the current relationship, NVIDIA Is Not Sending OpenAI $100 Billion, nor will it send it that much money, because 90% of OpenAI‚Äôs funding is gated behind building 9 or 10 gigawatts of data center capacity. In the current relationship, OpenAI does not have the money to pay Oracle. Also, can Oracle even afford to give that much money to NVIDIA? It had negative free cash flow last quarter, already has $104 billion in debt, and its biggest new customer cannot afford a single fucking thing it‚Äôs promised. The only company in this diagram that actually can afford to do any of this shit is NVIDIA, and even then it only has $56 billion cash on hand. In any case, as I went over on Friday, OpenAI has promised about a trillion dollars between compute contracts across Oracle, Microsoft, Google and CoreWeave, 17 Gigawatts of promised data centers in America between NVIDIA and ‚ÄúStargate,‚Äù several more gigawatts of international data centers, custom chips from Broadcom, and their own company operations. How exactly does this get paid for? Nobody seems to ask these questions! Why am I the asshole doing this? Don‚Äôt we have tech analysts that are meant to analyse shit? AHhhhh- Every time I sit down to write about this subject the newsletters seem to get longer, because people are so painfully attached to the norms and tropes of the past. This post is, already, 17,500 words ‚Äî a record for this newsletter ‚Äî and I‚Äôve still not finished editing and expanding it. What we‚Äôre witnessing is one of the most egregious wastes of capital in history, sold by career charlatans with their reputations laundered by a tech and business media afraid to criticize the powerful and analysts that don‚Äôt seem to want to tell their investors the truth. There are no historic comparisons here ‚Äî even Britain‚Äôs abominable 1800s railway bubble, which absorbed half of the country‚Äôs national income, created valuable infrastructure for trains, a vehicle that can move people to and from places. GPUs are not trains, nor are they cars, or even CPUs. They are not adaptable to many other kinds of work, nor are they ‚Äúthe infrastructure of the future of tech,‚Äù because they‚Äôre already quite old and with everybody focused on buying them, you‚Äôd absolutely see one other use case by now that actually mattered. GPUs are expensive, power-hungry, environmentally destructive and require their own kinds of cooling and server infrastructure, making every GPU data center and environmental and fiscal bubble unto themselves. And, whereas the Victorian train infrastructure still exists in the UK ‚Äî though it has been upgraded over the years ‚Äî a GPU has a limited useful lifespan. These are cards that can ‚Äî and will ‚Äî break after a period of extended usage, whether that period is five years or later, and they‚Äôll inevitably be superseded by something better and more powerful, meaning that the resale value of that GPU will only go down, with a price depreciation that‚Äôs akin to a new car. I am telling you, as I have been telling you for years, again and again and again, that the demand is not there for generative AI, and the demand is never, ever arriving. The only reason anyone humours any of this crap is the endless hoarding of GPUs to build capacity for a revolution that will never arrive. Well, that and OpenAI, a company built and sold on lies about ChatGPT‚Äôs capabilities. ChatGPT‚Äôs popularity ‚Äî and OpenAI‚Äôs hunger for endless amounts of compute ‚Äî have created the illusion of demand due to the sheer amount of capacity required to keep their services operational, all so they can burn $8 billion or more in 2025 and, if my estimates are right, nearly a trillion dollars by 2030. This NVIDIA deal is a farce ‚Äî an obvious attempt by the largest company on the American stock market to prop up the one significant revenue-generator in the entire industry, knowing that time is running out for it to create new avenues for eternal growth. I‚Äôd argue that NVIDIA‚Äôs deal also shows the complete contempt that these companies have for the media. There are no details about how this deal works beyond the initial $10 billion, there‚Äôs no land purchased, no data center construction started, and yet the media slurps it down without a second thought. I am but one man, and I am fucking peculiar. I did not learn financial analysis in school, but I appear to be one of the few people doing even the most basic analysis of these deals, and while I‚Äôm having a great time doing so, I am also exceedingly frustrated at how little effort is being put into prying apart these deals. I realize how ridiculous all of this sounds. I get it. There‚Äôs so much money being promised to so many people, market rallies built off the back of massive deals, and I get that the assumption is that this much money can‚Äôt be wrong, that this many people wouldn‚Äôt just say stuff without intending to follow through, or without considering whether their company could afford it. I know it‚Äôs hard to conceive that hundreds of billions of dollars could be invested in something for no apparent reason, but it‚Äôs happening, right god damn now, in front of your eyes, and I am going to be merciless on anyone who attempts to write a ‚Äúhow could we see this coming?‚Äù Generative AI has never been reliable, has always been unprofitable, and has always been unsustainable, and I‚Äôve been saying so since February 2024. The economics have never made sense, something I‚Äôve said repeatedly since April 2024, and when I wrote ‚ÄúHow Does OpenAI Survive?‚Äù in July 2024, I had multiple people suggest I was being alarmist. Here‚Äôs some alarmism for you: the longer it takes for OpenAI to die, the more damage it will cause to the tech industry. On Friday, when I put out my piece on OpenAI needing a trillion dollars, I asked analyst Gil Luria if the capital was there to build the 17 Gigawatts that OpenAI had allegedly planned to build. He said the following: That doesn‚Äôt sound good! Anyway, as I discussed earlier, venture capital could run out in six quarters, with investor and researcher Jon Sakoda estimating that there will only be around $164 billion of dry powder (available capital) in US VC firms by the end of 2025. In July, The French Tech Journal reported (using Pitchbook data) that global venture capital deal activity reached its lowest first-half total since 2018, with $139.4 billion in deal value in the first half of 2025, down from $183.4 billion in the first half of 2024, meaning that any further expansion or demands for venture capital from OpenAI will likely sap the dwindling funds available from other startups. Things get worse when you narrow things to US venture capital. In a piece from April, EY reported that VC-backed investment in US companies hit $80 billion in Q1 2025, but ‚Äúone $40 billion deal‚Äù accounted for half of the investment ‚Äî OpenAI‚Äôs $40 billion deal of which only $10 billion has actually closed, and that didn‚Äôt happen until fucking June. Without the imaginary money from OpenAI, US venture would have declined by 36%. The longer that OpenAI survives, the longer it will sap the remaining billions from the tech ecosystem, and I expect it to extend its tendrils to private credit too. The $325 billion it needs just to fulfil its NVIDIA contract, albeit over 4 years, is an egregious sum that I believe exceeds the available private capital in the world. Let‚Äôs get specific, and check out the top 10 private equity firms‚Äô available capital! Assuming that all of this capital is currently available, the top 10 private equity firms in the world have around $477 billion of available capital. We can, of course, include investment banks ‚Äî Goldman Sachs had around $520 billion cash in hand available at the end of its last quarter, and JPMorgan over $1.7 trillion, but JP Morgan has only dedicated $50 billion in direct lending commitments as of February 2025, and while Goldman Sachs expanded its direct private credit lending by $15 billion back in June, that appears to be an extension of its ‚Äúmore than $20 billion‚Äù direct lending close from mid-2024. Include both of those, and that brings us up to ‚Äî if we assume that all of these funds are available ‚Äî $562 billion in capital and about $164 billion in US venture available to spend, and that‚Äôs meant to go to more places than just OpenAI. Sure, sure, there‚Äôs more than just the top 10 private equity firms and there‚Äôs venture money outside of the US, but what could it be? Like, another $150 billion? You see, OpenAI needs to buy those GPUs, and it needs to build those data centers, and it needs to pay its thousands of staff and marketing and sales costs too. While OpenAI likely wouldn‚Äôt be the ones raising the money for the data centers ‚Äî and honestly, I‚Äôm not sure who would do it at this point? ‚Äî somebody is going to need to build TWENTY GIGAWATTS OF DATA CENTERS if we‚Äôre to believe both Oracle and NVIDIA You may argue that venture funds and private credit can raise more, and you‚Äôre right! But at this point, there have been few meaningful acquisitions of AI companies, and zero exits from the billions of dollars put into data centers. Even OpenAI admits in its own announcement about new Stargate sites that this will be a ‚Äú$400 billion investment over 3 years.‚Äù Where the fuck is that money coming from? Is OpenAI really going to absorb massive chunks of all available private credit and venture capital for the next few years? And no, god, stop saying the US government will bail this out. It will have to bail out hundreds of billions of dollars, there is no scenario where it‚Äôs anything less than that, and I‚Äôve already been over this. While the US government has spent equivalent sums in the past to support private business (the total $440 billion dispersed during the Great Recession‚Äôs TARP program, where the Treasury bought toxic assets from investment banks to stop them from imploding a la Lehman, springs to mind), it‚Äôs hard to imagine any case where OpenAI is seen as vital to the global financial system ‚Äî and the economic health of the US ‚Äî as the banking system. Sure, we spent around $1tn ‚Äî if we‚Äôre being specific, $953bn ‚Äî on the Paycheck Protection Program during the Covid era, but that was to keep people employed at a time when the economy outside of Zoom and Walmart had, for all intents and purposes, ceased to exist. There was an urgency that doesn‚Äôt apply here. If OpenAI goes tits up, Softbank loses some money ‚Äî nothing new there ‚Äî and Satya Nadella has to explain why he spent tens of billions of dollars on a bunch of data centers filled with $50,000 GPUs that are, at this point, ornamental. And while there will be ‚Äî and have been ‚Äî disastrous economic consequences, they won‚Äôt be as systemically catastrophic as that of the pandemic, or the global financial crisis. To be clear, it‚Äôll be bad, but not as bad. And there‚Äôs also the problem of moral hazard ‚Äî if the government steps in, what‚Äôs to stop big tech chasing its next fruitless rainbow? ‚Äî and optics. If people resented bailing out the banks after they acted like profligate gamblers and lost, how will they feel bailing out fucking Sam Altman and Jensen Huang? I do apologize for the length of this piece, but the significance of this bubble requires depth. There is little demand, little real money, and little reason to continue, and the sheer lack of responsibility and willingness to kneel before the powerful fills me full of angry bile. I understand many journalists are not in a position where they can just write ‚Äúthis shit sounds stupid,‚Äù but we have entered a deeply stupid era, and by continuing to perpetuate the myth of AI, the media guarantees that retail investors and regular people‚Äôs 401Ks will suffer. It is now inevitable that this bubble bursts. Deutsche Bank has said the AI boom is unsustainable outside of tech spending ‚Äúremaining parabolic,‚Äù which it says ‚Äúis highly unlikely,‚Äù and Bain Capital has said that $2 trillion in new revenue is needed to fund AI‚Äôs scaling, and even that math is completely fucked as it talks about ‚ÄúAI-related savings‚Äù: Even when stared in the face by a ridiculous idea ‚Äî $2 trillion of new revenue in a global software market that‚Äôs expected to be around $817 billion in 2025 ‚Äî Bain still oinks out some nonsense about the ‚Äúsavings from applying AI in sales, marketing, customer support and R&D,‚Äù yet another myth perpetuated I assume to placate the fucking morons sinking billions into this. Every single ‚Äúvibe coding is the future,‚Äù ‚Äúthe power of AI,‚Äù and ‚ÄúAI job loss‚Äù story written perpetuates a myth that will only lead to more regular people getting hurt when the bubble bursts. Every article written about OpenAI or NVIDIA or Oracle that doesn‚Äôt explicitly state that the money doesn‚Äôt exist, that the revenues are impossible, that one of the companies involved burns billions of dollars and has no path to profitability, is an act of irresponsible make believe and mythos. I am nobody. I am not a financier. I am not anybody special. I just write a lot, and read a lot, and can do the most basic maths in the world. I am not trying to be anything other than myself, nor do I have an agenda, other than the fact that I like doing this and I hate how this story is being told. I never planned for this newsletter to get this big, and now that it has, I‚Äôm going to keep doing the same thing every week. I also believe that the way to stop this happening again is to have a thorough and well-sourced explanation of everything as it happens, ripping down the narratives as they‚Äôre spun and making it clear who benefits from them and how and why they‚Äôre choosing to do so. When things collapse, we need to be clear about how many times people chose to look the other way, or to find good faith ways to interpret bad faith announcements and leak.
