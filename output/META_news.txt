Donald Trump Truth Social 01:11 PM EST 12/08/24… pic.twitter.com/JYamMQeHYr — Donald J. Trump Posts From His Truth Social (@TrumpDailyPosts) December 8, 2024 * * * “Trump allies adopt new strategy for nominees: Make the doubters pay” [Politico]. “Donald Trump’s transition team entered a critical week of nomination meetings on Capitol Hill with a new head of steam, emboldened by a swarm of grassroots support and a pressure campaign that has revived Pete Hegseth’s hopes for Defense secretary and given them confidence about other controversial nominees, too. In recent days, allies of Trump adopted an approach that is not novel for the president-elect and his followers: Make life extremely uncomfortable for anyone who dares to oppose him. The swarm of MAGA attacks that Sen. Joni Ernst has experienced is a warning of what’s in store for others who express skepticism of his personnel choices.” “Growing momentum for Cabinet picks who could define Trump’s second term” [CNN]. “he Cabinet confirmation drama around Donald Trump’s most provocative picks [is] mostly about Trump himself, and the kind of presidency he wants, the one he will end up getting, and the hopes of his MAGA movement that he’ll stand firm on his vow to shake the federal administrative state to its core and enact his and their revenge.” As for Ernst: “The Iowa Republican had faced warnings on social media that she’d encounter a primary challenge in 2026 if she didn’t shelve her reservations about Hegseth. The president-elect’s son, Donald Trump Jr., last week, for instance, amplified a post on X that pointed out that Ernst had been among almost all GOP senators who voted to confirm President Joe Biden’s Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, saying that anyone who did so and then criticized Hegseth was maybe ‘in the wrong political party!'” “‘I Support Pete’: Ernst Changes Tune Following Second Hegseth Meeting” [The Federalist]. “Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, indicated she will confirm Pete Hegseth as the next secretary of defense on Monday. The announcement marks a stark pivot for Ernst, who has been leading a behind-the-scenes effort to tank Hegseth’s nomination. ‘I appreciate Pete Hegseth’s responsiveness and respect for the process,’ Ernst said in a press release. ‘Following our encouraging conversations, Pete committed to completing a full audit of the Pentagon and selecting a senior official who will uphold the roles and value of our servicemen and women — based on quality and standards, not quotas — and who will prioritize and strengthen my work to prevent sexual assault within the ranks. As I support Pete through this process, I look forward to a fair hearing based on truth, not anonymous sources.'” “Key GOP senators begin to fall in line to support Kash Patel and keep door open for Pete Hegseth” [CNN]. “Top GOP senators on Monday signaled support for Donald Trump’s plan to oust the current FBI director in favor of firebrand loyalist Kash Patel, while keeping the door open for Pete Hegseth, who faces a slate of misconduct allegations, as the president-elect’s pick to run the Pentagon…. It is still early in the vetting process for Trump’s Cabinet nominees and confirmation votes won’t take place until next year. But it is clear that GOP senators are being careful to pick their battles and cautious of how they approach the president-elect’s selections.” * * * “Cold Shoulder: Democrats Ignore Tulsi Gabbard’s Request To Meet” [CNN]. Worst of all, Gabbard was a DNC vice-chair, but resigned to endorse Sanders. “There is some evidence that skepticism of a muscular foreign policy has gained traction among younger Democrats and independents in the last four or five years. When Hillary Clinton questioned Gabbard’s logic and loyalty, Gabbard punched back. In a series of tweets, she called the former secretary of State and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee “the queen of warmongers” and “personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party.'” • Where’s the lie? The #Resistance “Sanctuary cities resist Trump’s deportation plan. It could cost their residents” [USA Today]. “While a post-election poll by YouGov for CBS News shows that a massive 73% of adults want President-elect Donald Trump to prioritize the repatriation of illegal migrants, the [Denver Mayor Mike Johnston] pledged to not only have Denver police ‘stationed at the county line to keep (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) out’ but also that ‘you would have 50,000 Denverites there.’ Johnston said it would be like a ‘Tiananmen Square moment’ and answered yes when questioned whether he’d be ready to go to jail. That moment soon passed, however, as lawyers apparently explained to the mayor that armed resistance to the federal government is often called – wait for it – insurrection.” • Oopsie. Democrats en déshabillé “Russiagate Remnants” [Michael R. Caputo, Racket News]. “All of us agree the original Russiagate conspiracy continues even today. The Russia hoax was created by Hillary Clinton aide Jake Sullivan, who carries on with his lies today as President Joe Biden’s national security advisor. Christopher Steele, the British spy hired by Clinton to create the dodgy dossier, and his Fusion GPS co-conspirator Glenn Simpson are still doing the same work for similar clients. Andrew Weissmann, Peter Strzok, John Brennan, and more still peddle their lies. Elements of the original conspiracy were woven into Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 American election, then bogus Trump impeachments, January 6th prosecutions, anti-Trump lawfare, and Special Counsel Jack Smith’s Mar-a-lago raid. FBI Director Patel can prove the original 2016 conspiracy continues today. Much of the evidence remains in federal and public databases. Preemptive pardons aside, that means Sullivan, Weissmann, Mary McCord, Steele, Simpson, Victoria Nuland, Alexander Vindman, Eric Ciaramella, Smith, and others may still be in the jackpot. We agree with attorney Mike Davis: these perpetrators potentially violated 18 U.S.C. § 241 and 242, federal civil rights statutes that prohibit conspiracies to violate the rights of others.” • Worth reading in full.

Stay safe out there! Airborne Transmission “AirFanta 3Pro Review – A High-Performance Yet Affordable Air Purifier” [BreatheSafeAir]. “After having the 3Pro set up inside my office for over two weeks now, I am happy to be able to present my full review of the device. For anyone unaware, this purifier is designed to filter a massive amount of air (we will discuss the CADR and more soon!) at a relatively affordable price. It does this by being essentially a pre-assembled CR (Corsi-Rosenthal) Box – a form of air purifier that was itself created due to the need for affordable and effective air purification devices. While the 3Pro doesn’t embrace the typical DIY aspect of traditional CR Boxes, it has the advantage of having proven performance (no need to worry about whether your DIY box is effective!) and being ready to go out of the box. However, perhaps my favourite aspect of this device over traditional CR Boxes is how easily obtainable it is. While this probably isn’t an issue for anyone in the U.S. or Europe, I find it hard to source good HEPA filters in New Zealand at an affordable price. The 3Pro ensures I don’t run into this issue.” • Worth a read if you’re in the market.

Stats Watch Small Business Optimism: “United States NFIB Business Optimism Index” [Trading Economics]. “The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index in the US jumped to 101.7 in November 2024, the highest reading since June 2021, compared to 93.7 in October and beating forecasts of 94.2. It is also the first time in 34 months that the reading is above the 50-year average of 98, in response to the presidential election. “The election results signal a major shift in economic policy, leading to a surge in optimism among small business owners. Main Street also became more certain about future business conditions following the election, breaking a nearly three-year streak of record high uncertainty. Owners are particularly hopeful for tax and regulation policies that favor strong economic growth as well as relief from inflationary pressures. In addition, small business owners are eager to expand their operations”, NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg.” * * * Manufacturing: “Exclusive-Boeing restarts 737 MAX production a month after strike ended, sources say” [Reuters]. “Production resumed on Friday, said one of the sources, who all spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with media. Boeing declined to comment. The production restart had not been previously reported. The head of the Federal Aviation Administration, Mike Whitaker, told Reuters on Thursday that Boeing had not yet resumed 737 MAX production but planned to do so later this month.” Manufacturing: “Boeing shares jump as 737 MAX production reportedly resumes” [Sharecast]. “The stock was up nearly 5% at $164.80 by 1034 in New York, trading at levels not seen since late-August.” Tech: “AI slop is already invading Oregon’s local journalism” [Oregon Public Broadcasting (PI)]. “The Daily Tidings appears to be the first time an Oregon news outlet has stolen the identities of real journalists to trick local readers with AI-generated content. The goal is apparently to deceive Oregonians into giving clicks — and the resulting ad revenue — to whoever is behind the website.” • Horrid detail. Theft and fraud all the way down.

I believe that people can have rich, fulfilling lives with or without partners; I also know that courtship has never been easy. But research supports the idea that, in recent years, the United States has seen a particularly pronounced crisis of faith in romance. The Pew Research Center, in an analysis of census data, found that as of 2019, 38 percent of adults were unpartnered—that is, not married or living with a partner—compared with 29 percent in 1990. In a survey Pew conducted that same year, half of single adults said they were not seeking dates. When Pew divided that result by gender, it found that 61 percent of single men said they were looking to date or find a relationship while only 38 percent of single women said the same. In other words, straight partnerships seem to be going out not with a 4B-style bang but with a whimper. And however subtle the shift might seem, it has huge implications for men and women: how they treat each other, whether they’re willing to trust each other, and how they’ll build their futures—together or apart.” • Hmm. Guillotine Watch “Anger at plan to turn Nazi tunnels into bunker for super-rich” [Yahoo News]. Better there than in the corridors of power at the EU and NATO. Oh, wait…. “A German property developer has sparked outrage with a plan to turn a World War II tunnel system into a luxury bunker for rich survivalists who fear the outbreak of World War III. Relatives of the prison labourers who built it under the Nazis are aghast at the business venture that is offering a crypto-currency called ‘BunkerCoin’ as entry tokens to the promised apocalypse shelter.” • Of course, Crypto. Class Warfare “The Tech Baron Seeking to Purge San Francisco of ‘Blues'” [Gil Duran, The New Republic]. April 2024. “‘What I’m really calling for is something like tech Zionism,” [Balaji Srinivasan] said.” • Oh. News of the Wired “Colour in the Middle Ages” [Medievalists.net]. “Michel Pastoureau writes that “the true medieval opposite for white was not so much black as red.” This can be seen in the way Europeans adapted chess. When the game was adopted in Europe, the pieces and chessboard were painted in white and red, contrasting with the black and red sets common in India and the Middle East. It was only towards the end of the Middle Ages that the white versus black dichotomy became more favoured. A key factor in this shift was the advent of printing, where black ink was used on white paper, reinforcing the perception of these colours as natural opposites.” “Don’t throw away your printed books: A meta-analysis on the effects of reading media on reading comprehension” [Educational Research Review] 2018. From the Discussion: “The results of the two meta-analyses in the present study yield a clear picture of screen inferiority, with lower reading comprehension outcomes for digital texts compared to printed texts, which corroborates and extends previous research (Kong et al., 2018; Singer & Alexander, 2017b; Wang et al., 2007). These results were consistent across methodologies and theoretical frameworks.” And: ” our results indicate that the screen inferiority effect has increased in the past 18 years, and that there were no differences in media effects between age groups. These surprising findings suggest that we cannot idly wait for screen inferiority to disappear as children are exposed to digital devices earlier and earlier in their lives, as adults gain more experience with the technology, or as technology improves. The data suggest that screen inferiority is a major challenge across age groups that becomes more severe as the presence of technology increases.” • Certainly conforms to my priors! * * * Contact information for plants: Readers, feel free to contact me at lambert [UNDERSCORE] strether [DOT] corrente [AT] yahoo [DOT] com, to (a) find out how to send me a check if you are allergic to PayPal and (b) to find out how to send me images of plants.

Thank you! Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it. Printed books, cards, and tabletop games come in handy during power outages. Don’t throw away your printed books: A meta-analysis on the effects of reading media on reading comprehension I have been harping on this for some time, especially in regards to NC content. Good meaty posts and whenever Yves tells me to get a cup of coffee means I invariably copy and paste the words into a word processor and print it out. One could also hit the “Printer Friendly and PDF” at the end of the post, but I prefer the fancy OpenType fonts I have already installed in the word processor. Reading text on paper as opposed to monitors and phones will save your eyes, and your comprehension and memory of the content will be deeper. For example, I printed Rob Urie’s post today on the state of greedy health insurance. Of course, this means I miss out on participating in the comments. i have an old trailerhouse full of books. i call it “The Library”. but i can no longer read any of them without getting a headache or eyestrain. because i cant afford to go to the eye doctor(after almost 9 years) to get new real eyeglasses. so i’m stuck with “walmart readers” of varying magnification…yellow/green ones for in here in my bed, with laptop at the foot of it….purply ones for out at the bar…brown ones for in the truck…last actual prescriptions, held together with caulk, superglue and tape, in the golf cart. on the laptop, whether here, in bed, or out at bar, i an make these letters frelling huge, and do just that. i reckon that more healthcare executives need to be shot on the side of the road for the message to get through,lol. “Access to Healthcare” makes a nice slogan you can yammer on about…and your PMC healthcare might be awesome….but i have none at all….as do so very many of my compatriots. and when we hear how awesome obamacare is, in Texas, well…look over yer shoulder for the rest of your natural, and likely artificially extended, life. (i’m busy thinning the damned catherd, so have no bullets to spare) Meanwhile, back at the gerontocracy ranch: https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5032783-mcconnell-falls-medical-attention/ I appreciate your explanation of end of term legislation. The need however for members of Congress to express disdain for a civilization of 1.4 billion thoroughly benign people is saddening. At least this can be otherwise dismissed. Thank you so much. I didn’t mean to dismiss your concern. It is quite valid. And it is possible the same bill will come up in the next Congress, but it has to start from scratch – find sponsors, go through committees, etc. Congressional procedures can be arcane. These guys know how to work it. “I didn’t mean to dismiss your concern…” You are terrific. Where’s the lie? There isn’t one of course, which is a problem because truth and trust are the costly enemy, but lies, ignorance, and hatred are their profitable friends. And the Democrats reflexively, without any deliberations, destroy anyone who they think is the enemy Indeed. I think Gabbard will be the hardest nominee to confirm. She will be opposed by all Democrats of course. But most of the Republicans are also warmongering hawks. None of the other nominees, including Patel, have dared to question our foreign policy as openly as she has. Mumbling vaguely that we shouldn’t “get involved” in certain foreign conflicts is not the same thing as visiting Syria, saying Assad is not our enemy, and condemning our use of Islamist extremists as proxies against him. She will have her words thrown back in her face, forcing her to either dissemble with some sort of patriotic mush or stand by her words and admit “our government” was lying. What will she say about Assad now, for example? I think it may rather be what will Syria have to say about itself between now and any confirmation hearing. That is a two month window to find out what the uni-party has created and whether there will be calls for boots on the ground there, the responsibility to protect those helpless wheat fields and benign oil reserves. By the time of her confirmation hearings, Syria will be a Jihadist cesspool and nobody will have any appetite for putting boots on the ground. The repercussions of the fall of Syria will be plain to see and Gabbard will not be shy in pointing this out. Old Joe took the credit for Assad’s fall so now the consequences will be on the Democrats. By the time Gabbard hearings happen, our formerly cuddly Jihadis will be at war with Israel. (Heck, the way IDF is invading deep into Syria, it could start before the year is out.) That will cause some interesting contortions. For all we know, the shooter didn’t expect to survive. Perhaps he didn’t expect to survive, particularly given that he apparently suffers from severe chronic back pain. I had a friend who did himself in with pills and booze because of it. In any event, he’s become a cause celebre. Should he survive incarceration and not go the way of Epstein, his trial will be quite something. I wonder how deeply his defence will be allowed to explore and explain his motivation to a jury as a powerful mitigating circumstance, essentially putting the healthcare system on trial. I suppose jury nullification is a possibility but probably too much to hope for. I am sorry about your friend. I have (or had) a close relative who did the same at the age of 57. And now I too have the same back condition, though I avoid booze and pills. It really does put limitations on one’s life and a pall over one’s outlook. I can imagine it must be even more upsetting to a younger person — since you know will have to live with it that much longer. yeah. back problems are the worst. out of all my numerous broken bones and other sundry injuries to my skeleton, the 2 old, self-healed compression fractures in my back are the worst, by far. especially with cold fronts, hurricanes, etc. nothing you can do to get away from it. mine are likely from hauling feedsacks on one shoulder when i was much younger. nothing radicalisises you like constant pain, and an indifferent and uncaring healthcare system…but yer likely too frelled up to go all crazy like Luigi did. i sure as hell couldnt. my skeleton prevents travel. lucky for the aristocracy, i suppose. (yes, feeling murderous, tonight,lol….let lindsey graham or some other warmongering asshat wander in front of my truck tomorrow, and we’ll see…if i see them…in time.) Hannah Arendt noted that “The ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi or the dedicated communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction, true and false, no longer exists.” Two things on the accused Adjuster. First, while a rapid arrest was no doubt greatly wished by TPTB, I’m not sure the guy they got, regardless of guilt, is the one they wanted or needed. This is someone, who with family, can take this to a trial where a guilty verdict is highly unlikely and where the defense will air a lot of facts and figures our politicians and Big Health (Insurance, private health providers, health services and Big Pharma) really really do not want to get a lot of air play. And even having a friendly judge will not help them, because anything they deny for the defense will be being aired in public regardless. Second is just amusing, had a conversation with a NYC police officer today about how so much of the surveillance video I see really does not provide enough detail for people to really recognize people or cars, especially since the general NYC public uniform of black clothing becomes a black blob. They threw in that they didn’t understand why the Adjuster went to Altoona and didn’t just stay in NYC. Mostly because for all the surveillance it really isn’t as comprehensive and easy as we think and with so many people it is much easier to just blend in with the crowd. Maybe the Adjuster believes that the surveillance system in NYC is more all-powerful than the systems in other places. However, I notice that that NYC police officer either assumes that NYC Guy and Altoona Guy are the same guy, or he wants everyone hearing/reading his words to assume it. I for one do not assume it. So I have no way of knowing whether NYC Guy ever went to Altoona or not. Re: above tweets about back pain surgery. I agree 100% – it is among the most overused and worthless procedures in all of a medicine. And it can leave lasting issues in maybe most patients that are worse than the original issue ever was. If we wanted to set the DOGE police on medicine, one of the easiest low-hanging fruits would be the abuse of back surgery. 35 years ago – the rule was – No back surgery unless the patient is paralyzed (or with a clear imminent impending paralysis) and there is possible hope of reversing that. THE END. Now there are surgeons doing “minimally invasive” procedures 10 times a day. It seldom works well. And it can be castastrophically tragic for many. This is ESPECIALLY true of the morbidly obese – they should lose weight. And the young jock types – they should be doing core work and extra training – not surgery. The problem with doing this on a young athlete is their life, their exercise and their ability to perform will never be the same. And this does not go well for so many of them. The physical therapy and extra exercise may take months – but it is so much better in the long run. We have a chronic pain problem here in the USA – we have completely out of control expectations and it leads to so many tragedies. Always remember – this one issue has been what I would call the “nexus” of the opioid epidemic. When these surgeries go bad – and they almost always do – the patient is left in varying degrees of horrific pain – ready to self-medicate or worse. And always remember – this type of surgery is a HUGE moneymaker for Big Hospital – there are entire hospitals across the land that do nothing but this. It is ripe for fraud – and this has played out among back surgeons going to jail all over this country. And never forget the story of Dr. Death. Again – I have no qualms about the DOGE dogs being unleashed on this. Something must be done. Thanks. One of my aunts had back surgery and everything you just said. I’m old enough to have arthritis, which runs in the family, and for awhile could barely walk due to swollen knees. Ever since I’ve tried to walk a couple of miles per day and don’t have any trouble at all with my legs. Of course younger people may not have the time to take walks. But perhaps you have to avoid the magic bullets as one gets older and go old school. IM Doc Re: above tweets about back pain surgery. I agree 100% – it is among the most overused and worthless procedures in all of a medicine. [ This is precisely what the chair of orthopedics at Harvard explained at a dinner. ] Forgive me for not be clearer. As I understood the chair of orthopedics, the problem was in using surgery for pain that could be and should rather be resolved by physical therapy or routine exercise. Much back pain can be resolved, I learned, by strengthening stomach muscles with bent-knee sit-ups. In college, there were a number of helpful exercises that wrestlers used for their backs, rowers as well and even for me as a runner. I was only repeating in summary dinner comments that stayed with me. I, for instance, as a runner, used bent-knee sit-ups for my back each day. Amen. “Core Strength” is key to a healthy life and old age; balanced back and front work that keep your body working normally. However, most people would rather die and be disabled than to arse themselves to work on this. Thankfully, my orthopedic Docs at Stanford, one for back, another for knees, are both strong proponents of physical therapy, reserving surgery as a last resort. Just to balance the narrative – I had back surgery 25 years ago and it was a life changer. I went from being unable to walk to being fine. For a pain free and full mobility quarter century, I am most grateful. The only lasting effect is a slight weakness on the side that had the pinched sciatic nerve, and that was much worse before the surgery. I do believe physical therapy after surgery helped in my case. Pretty much the same with me. Had a herniated disc and had to use a walker to get anywhere. The surgery was straightforward and recovery quick. However, I believe any fusion of back bones should be avoided. “I had back surgery 25 years ago and it was a life changer…” I much appreciate the balancing, and am pleased for you. A Doctor partially paralyzed my step grandpa after a back surgery gone wrong. He retired as a City Bud Driver and had chronic pain. Then why do the insurance companies approve these procedures? To sell profitable pain killers for years through their pharma subsidiary, at least that’s what United Healthcare does. How does back surgery mesh with the Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) cheer-leaders, or do profits put a thumb on the scale? (I’m still having problems wrapping my head around US-backed Jihadis promising Diversity and Democracy.) That’s only because you think they believe or mean those promises. If you decide to believe that they are being coached to say it for the cameras for the time being, then you won’t have problems wrapping your head around it. Remember the deathless words of Erdogan. ” I see that Democracy is like a bus. I get on it and ride till it gets me where I want to go. Then I get off.” I don’t believe in anything except the Kalama Sutta and I watch what the hands are doing. To paraphrase Sid Arthur from 2500 years or so ago, “Go kick a rock.” The physical therapy and extra exercise may take months – but it is so much better in the long run. Years, in my case. 12-24 months after starting I was still getting episodes, and things were better but not by all that much. It felt like I was making no progress. Somehow I kept at it and things did change (slowly) and today after >10 years I’m barely troubled by it any more. I know it’s still there – sometimes something sets it off – but it’s a minor niggle for a few days and doesn’t prevent me from doing anything I want to do or cause any serious discomfort. It used to wipe me out completely for weeks on end. I think what kept me going was noticing small improvements in things I hadn’t even realized were a problem. After 6-12 months I could stand for longer than an hour without needing to sit down. I hadn’t even realized that was abnormal. I realized that if I stopped, things would just keep getting worse. aye. guy who did my hip replacement actually warned me away from any back surgery to fix these compression fractures….and the big ortho outfit he worked for had that as a big part of their business model. and, please IMDoc, remember that not all of us long term opioid patients are junkies. the vicodin doesnt remove the pain, but it does mitigate it( i miss it when i miss a dose)…and when i do my every 2 or 3 year drug holiday to reset the receptors and start again at 5mg, i have had zero withdrawal symptoms. careful with big brushes,lol. Great post, thanks. Working hard to keep my back muscles strong enough to never develop chronic pain. And worried sick my 80-something friends are going down a similar road with the electrophysiologists, so very eager to implant devices in anyone with sometimes-erratic heartbeats. A lifesaver, sure, for some. A really nice money-maker for them? Also sure. It makes me leery. I am lucky that my back pain was managed by the VA, who had undertaken a whole new approach to pain management. No opiates and invasive procedures unless absolutely necessary. Wholistic approach which included education, physical therapy, “non-traditional” procedures like acupuncture, and very mild, non-opiate based painkillers as necessary. I did undergo ablasion, which certainly helped. The combination of all of these has kept me reasonably pain-free for five years now, with occasional flare-ups which I can manage using the knowledge gained from the pain-management classes, with massage, acupuncture and exercises. All in all, it has allowed me to remain active and go on long hikes with reasonable weight load. The question is, why don’t private insurers stimulate more hospital systems to go to that approach? I am reasonably certain that my care was both cheaper, monetarily and socialy, and more effective, than what’s being offered to the privately insured. Ernst is playing a role. Can’t have Thune, protégé of Turtle, get sullied with any pre-nomination discourse or controversy. Keep that powder, or those favors, for future matters. Meanwhile, Ernst gets some press visibility. Win-win for the Shell game and Turtle legacy protection. A question: Will NC take a closer look at Romania and the annulled election? It is surprising how little media are reporting on what is a gigantic scandal, if one takes the notion of free elections in the EU seriously. It is a de-facto Russiagate à la roumaine that has changed the outcome of a political process for real. That is quite something. Taibbi should be looking into this….(did he?) Romania is also interesting since it’s a textbook case of old and new elites realigning after ’89. The place never came to peace. Which is why people don’t take politics there seriously. It’s pretty tragic and ugly. “It is surprising how little media are reporting on what is a gigantic scandal…” Given the givens, I’m surprised that you’re surprised. The bit of MSM news I saw recently accentuated the dastardly deployment of Russian backed social media as being responsible for voters making an unacceptable choice. After the Moldovan President was re-elected based on the votes coming from the Moldovan diaspora and not those living in Moldova, it is no surprise. Ursula is centralizing as much power as she can in Brussels so I can see a day when it will be Brussels that will dictate the authenticity of an election held and maybe even who is allowed to stand for office. More of those “EU values” that we keep on hearing about. Well, they just canceled election because they lost, and the reason given is far more ridiculous than the original Russiagate. So I guess there is not much to talk about, if the Romanians themselves accept it without fight. Maybe that’s the actual message, that everyone sort of accepts EU is fixing election right and left, like nobody was making big fuss about the fairness of latest “election” in USSR. Don’t forget that Pres Yoon of SK claiming thst he ordered martial law as a measure against electoral fraud. Re: Don’t throw away your printed books […] I am eagerly awaiting my option to subscribe to NC in print! re: “Don’t throw away your printed books: I am divided on this. Do I really read F Scott Fitzgerald differently, do I process it differently when reading it as a printed book in contrast to reading it on an e-book reader? How deep does the scientific evidence reach here? Is it merely external phenoma that are measured? Or more substantial internal matters? How far can brain functions be identified with 100% certainty and connected with genuine different results? Is it due to the technology itself? Or due to the notion of multi-tasking? Which would have nothing to do with possible inferiority of the technology of reading on digital devices as such. I can’t comment about e-readers because I don’t own one, but my experience tells me that I undoubtedly process words better on paper than on screen. And by “process” I don’t necessarily mean high level deep emotional processing (prefrontal cortex, amygdala) but rather lower level visual processing (retina, thalamus). Reading nice serif fonts on paper affords me less eye strain and fatigue, which could indirectly allow me to better comprehend the content of the text I am reading. You ask some very tough questions about how we can even measure brain functions and how it relates to reading comprehension. I don’t have a good answers, but you can still reap benefits of not reading all day on screens. It’s like intuitively understanding that eating lots of un-manufactured and unprocessed vegetables is a great idea even if you don’t have a good understanding of how digestion affects health. NC’s favorite contributor, Michael Hudson, agrees in his most recent article on how publishing monopolies are squeezing writers. Hudson laments screens causing him eyestrain and the publishers insisting on using tiny print with ugly typefaces on the paper versions. As knowledgeable as Hudson is, he probably doesn’t have the clout to dictate the typography in his books. (Whose poor idea was it to not include an index in Killing The Host? I doubt it was Michael himself.) Edward Tufte certainly has the clout to tell publishers how to style and design his books. Take a look at Tufte’s books. They have the most beautiful graphic design and typography. (I believe Tufte commonly uses the Sabon font in his books.) Needless to say I grew up a printed book person. However I am asking the “devil’s advocate’s” questions because I lack some knowledge on this that you might have and others on NC. Meaning: the serious scientific scholarship on this. Those who’s jobs in publishing it is to read books for real were the first ones who – as my circle of friends is concerned – were all with the “digital revolution” simply for practical reasons. There are as you say all sorts of issues involved. My underlying question is indeed if it hade made a difference to me had I grown up with the same titles but not in print but well readable digital devices. A nice cruel experiment with twins growing up! As you and matt below point out, various needs make for various purchases. The most common I guess is print for reading and making notes (I at least cannot read and making notes on digital devices. It makes serious research impossible.) But the second purchase is the pdf to research studies which I already have worked through or for works that I have no time to check. (Admittedly a practice more often used due to commenting on blogs which is not a paid job after all. So at some point time is an issue.) But still the questions that you already pointed at for me (prefrontal cortex, amygdala /retina, thalamus) – are the ones of a normative magnitude. It’s like with mask mandates during Covid: Do masks not work because the virus slips through the material. Or do they not work because people are too lazy to use them properly or at all. From the scientific POV two completely different answers. But mixed in the public arena. As the quality of publishing goes – I believe so far Germany in this area is still a safehaven if you work with one of the Classic publishers and not some online outfit or self-publishing (which I would assume lacks the money). On the other hand I have encountered micro-trends where certain publishers fell for new trendy fonts which I found detestable. Thanks also for the Hudson link. US capitalism is full of surprises… my sister likes collecting printed books ‘in case something happens.’ and i agree it is nice to have paper books for power outages. but as a student, i am NOT about to purchase and lug around 5 massive textbooks all day. if you’re reading a book for fun, printed copies are nice. but for other reasons, they are not. or when it is wet. they are two technologies with different uses. sometimes you need a book but it’s expensive so all you have is a pirated pdf. also it’s easier to read in bed on your phone. instead of holding a flashlight under the sheets like i used to as a kid, i can simply read on the phone. I have to do log book entries for my work as an aircraft mechanic. Sometimes they are 500 to 1000 words. Filled with part numbers and manual references. I learned along time ago that I can’t proof read on the computer screen. I print it out and make corrections.

What do people think of the alleged manifesto by alleged American folk hero The Adjuster, Luigi Mangione? https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/luigis-manifesto “To the Feds, I’ll keep this short, because I do respect what you do for our country. To save you a lengthy investigation, I state plainly that I wasn’t working with anyone. This was fairly trivial: some elementary social engineering, basic CAD, a lot of patience. The spiral notebook, if present, has some straggling notes and To Do lists that illuminate the gist of it. My tech is pretty locked down because I work in engineering so probably not much info there. I do apologize for any strife of traumas but it had to be done. Frankly, these parasites simply had it coming. A reminder: the US has the #1 most expensive healthcare system in the world, yet we rank roughly #42 in life expectancy. United is the [indecipherable] largest company in the US by market cap, behind only Apple, Google, Walmart. It has grown and grown, but as our life expectancy? No the reality is, these [indecipherable] have simply gotten too powerful, and they continue to abuse our country for immense profit because the American public has allwed them to get away with it. Obviously the problem is more complex, but I do not have space, and frankly I do not pretend to be the most qualified person to lay out the full argument. But many have illuminated the corruption and greed (e.g.: Rosenthal, Moore), decades ago and the problems simply remain. It is not an issue of awareness at this point, but clearly power games at play. Evidently I am the first to face it with such brutal honesty.” But when he goes to trial, will the judge rule that inadmissible in court? Gotta watch those New York courts Why would it be inadmissible? Self-incrimination? But it was written before he was arrested. If it is admitted into court, then that brings the whole question of why he did what he did. Is that a can of worms that the courts want to open? The state of American healthcare? It would be safer to declare him insane and put him away and not go there. The big question is did Luigi actually write this. Commenters on Twitter are saying that it doesn’t read like his other posts online, like his GoodReads reviews. Also, I just can’t get my head around why someone who went to such lengths not to get caught and managed to escape NYC would then allow himself to get caught. At least turn yourself in to make the political statement. So much that seems unaccountable. Why did he stay ten whole days in New York? And in a hostel that requires in-person check-in and in which you’d be sharing a room with other guests? As for the final sentence, “I am the first to face it with such brutal honesty…” a kind of invitation to other adjustors? Mind you, no way on earth I would take up that invitation even if I can’t begrudge anyone who does. Sounds less Marxist than German Red Army Faction. But the gist is the same. The last couple of years made it difficult for people to further promote and believe in the idea of constructive grass-roots movements changing matters down to top. For some time now left groups had mostly abandonded force, violence, murder. Wonder how long that remains. Might we see more of this? I haven’t followed this closely as I usually don’t like murder stories. (However the sane political rationale makes it more interesting of course.) I wouldn’t be surprised if this event was instrumentalized as another pro-Dems story confirming the fears of violence under a Trump administration. Simply by Trump being there. Even without any proven affiliation. As of “the billionaire”-class won etc. re: “ Why did he stay ten whole days in New York?” He had theatre tickets? wanted to see the tree at Rockefeller Center? Skating in Central Park? The “Sienna” exhibit at the Met Museum (It’s very good)? “Frau Ohne Schatten” with Nina Stemme at the Met Opera ? (Also good). why does anybody stay in NYC for 10 days? Amazing that he had the time to gun anybody down. 😂 would make for a great comedy: “The man who wanted to be assassin.

I wonder whether people who learned to do their high-level reading on printed text are able to comprehend text on screens just as well as if it were printed. The reason I don’t throw away my printed books is so that I will still have something printed if/when the entire Internet and the entire digisphere goes dark and stays dark for good. Interesting. But then we did once have to learn how to read paper books and for some of us that happened very early. So I think the point is that it’s really about what’s in the books and the technology is a sidebar. Personally I did have trouble adjusting to reading ebooks and found that making the screen presentation–sharpness, serif text, a preferred two page per screen format–as much like a real book was the way to go. For this reason the old e-ink Kindle was a pain. There are Bezos’ good ideas and–so many–Bezos’ bad ideas. Meanwhile computer displays are now very sharp indeed and the contrast is unbeatable. Now I have trouble reading paper books. Of course paper copies of books should be kept somewhere and we once thought and perhaps still think this is the public library’s job. But it seems they aren’t into being archivists Most libraries nowadays are actively landfilling books so they can build studios to teach the kids how to Tiktok. Because that is what the kids need to know. Too bad we don’t have a Carnegie to donate the money and dictate that the libraries should do something other than what the Propaganda Broadcasting System (PBS) tells them is relevant. “Anger at plan to turn Nazi tunnels into bunker for super-rich” Of course where Dachau is located would make a great site for rural-residential living in a new gated community and conveniently situated near Munich.

The best thing he can do is withdraw as quickly as possible. Just like they did in Afghanistan. It would be a resounding defeat and the Democrats would be furious. But the Ukrainians and Americans should be reminded that it was Joe Biden who made them false promises. He knew that Ukraine could not defeat Russia. He told Zelenskyi not to negotiate with Russia, but to launch spring, summer and fall offensives, all of which failed. Agreed. But Trump will need to cut Ukraine loose quickly.

At least I wouldn´t know how. – Scott Horton Interview BERLINER ZEITUNG – “The reality is: the east of Ukraine is lost” – Scott Horton in an interview The representatives of an aggressive US foreign policy bear a large share of the responsibility for the war in Ukraine, says the American author Scott Horton in an interview. The war in Ukraine is currently reaching a turning point. The Ukrainian army seems to have little left to oppose the Russian army. President Volodymyr Selenskyj has admitted that he will have to come to terms with ceding territory to Russia. Will there be peace negotiations under US President Donald Trump? The American radio presenter and publicist Scott Horton has examined the history of the war in his new book “Provoked. How Washington started the New Cold War with Russia and the catastrophe in Ukraine”. The Berliner Zeitung spoke to him about the long-term goals of the USA, the role of Angela Merkel and possible peace scenarios. Mr. Horton, the war in Ukraine has been raging for almost three years now. The USA is Kiev’s most important ally. What are the long-term goals of the American government in Ukraine? It’s complicated. Essentially, they want to integrate Ukraine into the so-called American security umbrella and install a government that is friendly to them. Russia has been pressured with NATO’s constant eastward expansion. Of course, Russia’s neighbors wanted American protection. But the problem is that it became a self-fulfilling prophecy when it comes to a country like Ukraine, which is of paramount importance to Russia. When the US declared that Ukraine should become a member of the Western security architecture, a threshold was crossed. The US has been playing out NATO membership for Ukraine since the 1990s. But the smartest members of the American leadership have always warned against it. Ukraine’s history and Russia’s history are deeply intertwined. Russia has a significant strategic interest in the Sevastopol naval base in Crimea. The American strategy of integrating Ukraine out of Russia’s sphere of interest and into the Western sphere of influence became a direct threat to Russia, provoking a reaction. Would you say that the American government underestimated Russia? The part of the American establishment that was counting on further western integration of Ukraine did not think that Russia would invade Ukraine. I recall the words of Senator Chris Murphy, who praised the US role in overthrowing the government on television after the so-called Maidan revolution of 2014. Murphy said: “We did a great job.” The moderator then asked whether this might not provoke a conflict with Russia. Murphy replied: “That would be crazy.” He assumed that Russia would not intervene. A few weeks later, Ukraine lost Crimea and the east of the country was at war. In her biography, former German Chancellor Angela Merkel defended the decision not to admit Ukraine into NATO at the 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest. What effect did Merkel’s decision have at the time? Well, the so-called hawks, who stand for an aggressive American foreign policy, argue that if Ukraine had been given far-reaching military commitments at the time, the war would not have started in the first place, because Putin would not have attacked any NATO member. I think the more plausible answer is that Russia would have immediately launched an invasion of Ukraine, even before the NATO treaties were signed. The then US President George W. Bush was warned. The American ambassador to Russia, William Burns, wrote a memorandum in February 2008, published by Wikileaks, entitled “Njet means Njet. Russia’s Nato Enlargement Redlines”. In it, Burns warned his boss, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, against bringing Ukraine and Georgia into NATO. It was not just about Putin. For the entire Russian security apparatus, this would have crossed a line. In his memoirs, Burns later reported an email to Rice in which he explained to her what a sensitive point the issue was for Russia. Merkel and French President François Hollande did everything they could to stop Bush. But Bush was determined. They agreed to a compromise not to guarantee Ukraine a NATO membership process, but only that Kiev would one day be given the prospect of a NATO membership process. Merkel’s stance against Bush was in line with the leadership of the American security services and the US State Department. So was it a far-sighted decision by the then German Chancellor? Merkel was deeply concerned about provoking Russia. She did not think about what economic costs Germany would face in the event of a military conflict. The only question was, why should she provoke Putin if Germany could not gain any benefits from it. While President Joe Biden has always been a strong military supporter of Ukraine, his successor Donald Trump has announced that he will stop military aid to Ukraine. Why do the Democrats in the US have a stronger interest in Ukraine than the Republicans? I am not sure if that is the case. The political right accuses the Democrats of money laundering and shady dealings in Ukraine. I do not know anything specific about that. I think the scandal surrounding Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, who is said to have received bribes from Ukraine is not decisive. It starts earlier: Hunter Biden was installed at the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings to protect the company’s owner, Mykola Zlochevskyj. Zlochevskyj was closely linked to the government of the fugitive President Viktor Yanukovych. That is why he sought protection from the Americans. Burisma hired Hunter Biden, as well as the former CIA officer Cofer Black and the former President of Poland, Aleksander Kwaśniewski. To return to your question: Do the Democrats have a greater strategic interest in Ukraine than the Republicans? I would put it this way: the bipartisan consensus in US foreign policy is absolutely in agreement with Joe Biden. The new right that supports Trump is against an interventionist US foreign policy. The Republican establishment, such as the Republican minority leader in the US Senate, Mitch McConnell, is fully in line with the aggressive US foreign policy of George W. Bush, John McCain and Joe Biden. Their main concern now is damage limitation. The USA suffered a devastating defeat in Ukraine. It is just like in Afghanistan and Vietnam. The USA financed the war for years and millions of people died. In the end, the Reds were in Saigon, and today the Taliban are back in power in Kabul. The USA has plunged Ukraine into terrible chaos. In order to effectively push Russia back, the USA would have to station its own soldiers in Ukraine. But the price of a nuclear escalation would be too high for that. The reality is: the east of Ukraine is lost. The willingness of the American public to continue supporting Ukraine in the fight against Russia is declining. Why do the majority of Americans no longer support the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky? Because it is obvious that we have been lied to. They said we will support Ukraine against Russia for as long as it takes. But it was supposed to take a year or two. The media often tell the joke: “Russia has the second strongest army in the world. But it looks more like they only have the second strongest army in Ukraine.” But now the war has been going on for three years, and the leading newspapers in the USA agree, and Zelensky is also aware, that Ukraine will have to give up territory. The American public is not so interested in what is happening in Donetsk Oblast. They are much more concerned about the fact that bridges are eroding in their own country and that their own government is abandoning them in the event of serious natural disasters. When Hurricane Helene devastated North Carolina in September, the U.S. Army could have provided assistance. There are several locations in the state. Where were the Blackhawk helicopters to rescue Americans from the floods? They were in Europe supporting NATO and on their way to the Middle East. As people in North Carolina were fighting for survival, President Biden announced that another billion-dollar package for Ukraine would be approved. This is a major point why the Democrats lost the presidential election. The war in Ukraine pushed the German economy into recession. Since then, Germany no longer imports cheap gas from Russia, but expensive LNG from the USA. Is this just a combination of unfortunate circumstances? The Germans are the collateral damage in America’s economic war against Russia. The aim was to prevent as many Russian gas exports to the West as possible and to drive Russia into national bankruptcy. But that is not working. Russia is now exporting its gas to the East. American geostrategists, such as George Friedmann from the think tank Stratfor, discuss it surprisingly openly that the absolute priority for the USA is to separate Russia from Germany. The function of NATO is to keep America in, Germany down and the Russians out, as the first NATO Secretary General Lord Ismay described it in 1949. An alliance between Germany, the industrial superpower, and Russia, the resource superpower, would dominate Eastern Europe and destroy the influence of the Americans and British in the region. It is no coincidence that Senator Ted Cruz from my home state of Texas was a staunch opponent of the German-Russian Nord Stream 2 pipeline during the Trump and Biden years. Texas produces much of the American LNG that the US profitably supplies to Germany. Victoria Nuland, the former European representative at the US State Department, said to Cruz: “Well, Senator, what you always wanted has happened: Nord Stream 2 is a lump of metal on the seabed.” The Ukrainian president is increasingly losing support among the population. Do you think he will be able to hold on if Ukraine continues to go on the defensive? Zelenskyy has strengthened his power by suspending the presidential election and imposing martial law. It will depend on whether there will be powerful challengers who can offer an alternative. It also depends on which part of the population you ask. The further west you go, the more often you get the answer that the fight against Russia should continue. If you go to the east of the country, you are told to rely on negotiations. A serious problem is that neo-Nazis are gaining strong influence in Ukraine. Dmytro Yarosh and Andrei Biletsky have threatened Zelensky and his predecessor Petro Poroshenko with death. New York Times journalist Andrew Kramer has reported in detail on the danger posed by these people. They are actual descendants of Hitler’s collaborators in Ukraine who fought in World War II. They do not want to accept a ceasefire. For them, it would be a betrayal of the many soldiers who died in the war. They do not want to give up until they have won. If Zelensky starts peace negotiations, he will be in serious danger in the country. So, how will things turn out in Ukraine: Will we see peace in the next few weeks? I fear that the situation in Ukraine is so difficult that Trump will have a hard time making a deal. The best thing he can do is withdraw as quickly as possible. Just like they did in Afghanistan. It would be a crushing defeat and the Democrats would be furious. But it is worth reminding Ukrainians and Americans that it was Joe Biden who made them false promises. He knew that Ukraine could not defeat Russia. He told Zelensky not to negotiate with Russia but to launch spring, summer and fall offensives, all of which failed. But there are still some doubts as to whether Trump is even seeking peace with Russia. After all, he has chosen many hawks for his government team. And he is in no position to make any demands on Moscow. Given the current military situation, Putin can draw the border pretty much wherever he wants. The question is whether he will expand to Kharkiv and Odessa, or whether he will just annex the oblasts he already controls. The optimistic scenario would be an agreement that freezes the conflict and draws the border where it currently is. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Pixtral 12B is now available on Amazon SageMaker JumpStart
URL: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/pixtral-12b-is-now-available-on-amazon-sagemaker-jumpstart/
Time Published: 2024-12-10T18:21:22Z
Full Content:
Today, we are excited to announce that Pixtral 12B (pixtral-12b-2409), a state-of-the-art vision language model (VLM) from Mistral AI that excels in both text-only and multimodal tasks, is available for customers through Amazon SageMaker JumpStart. You can try this model with SageMaker JumpStart, a machine learning (ML) hub that provides access to algorithms and models that can be deployed with one click for running inference. In this post, we walk through how to discover, deploy, and use the Pixtral 12B model for a variety of real-world vision use cases. Pixtral 12B represents Mistral’s first VLM and demonstrates strong performance across various benchmarks, outperforming other open models and matching larger models, according to Mistral. Pixtral is trained to understand both images and documents, and shows strong abilities in vision tasks such as chart and figure understanding, document question answering, multimodal reasoning, and instruction following, some of which we demonstrate later in this post with examples. Pixtral 12B is able to ingest images at their natural resolution and aspect ratio. Unlike other open source models, Pixtral doesn’t compromise on text benchmark performance, such as instruction following, coding, and math, to excel in multimodal tasks. Mistral designed a novel architecture for Pixtral 12B to optimize for both speed and performance. The model has two components: a 400-million-parameter vision encoder, which tokenizes images, and a 12-billion-parameter multimodal transformer decoder, which predicts the next text token given a sequence of text and images. The vision encoder was newly trained that natively supports variable image sizes, which allows Pixtral to be used to accurately understand complex diagrams, charts, and documents in high resolution, and provides fast inference speeds on small images like icons, clipart, and equations. This architecture allows Pixtral to process any number of images with arbitrary sizes in its large context window of 128,000 tokens. License agreements are a critical decision factor when using open-weights models. Similar to other Mistral models, such as Mistral 7B, Mixtral 8x7B, Mixtral 8x22B and Mistral Nemo 12B, Pixtral 12B is released under the commercially permissive Apache 2.0, providing enterprise and startup customers with a high-performing VLM option to build complex multimodal applications. SageMaker JumpStart offers access to a broad selection of publicly available foundation models (FMs). These pre-trained models serve as powerful starting points that can be deeply customized to address specific use cases. You can now use state-of-the-art model architectures, such as language models, computer vision models, and more, without having to build them from scratch. With SageMaker JumpStart, you can deploy models in a secure environment. The models can be provisioned on dedicated SageMaker Inference instances, including AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia powered instances, and are isolated within your virtual private cloud (VPC). This enforces data security and compliance, because the models operate under your own VPC controls, rather than in a shared public environment. After deploying an FM, you can further customize and fine-tune the model, including SageMaker Inference for deploying models and container logs for improved observability.With SageMaker, you can streamline the entire model deployment process. Note that fine-tuning on Pixtral 12B is not yet available (at the time of writing) on SageMaker JumpStart. To try out Pixtral 12B in SageMaker JumpStart, you need the following prerequisites: You can access Pixtral 12B through SageMaker JumpStart in the SageMaker Studio UI and the SageMaker Python SDK. In this section, we go over how to discover the models in SageMaker Studio. SageMaker Studio is an IDE that provides a single web-based visual interface where you can access purpose-built tools to perform ML development steps, from preparing data to building, training, and deploying your ML models. For more details on how to get started and set up SageMaker Studio, refer to Amazon SageMaker Studio Classic. Deployment starts when you choose Deploy. When deployment is complete, an endpoint is created. You can test the endpoint by passing a sample inference request payload or by selecting the testing option using the SDK. When you use the SDK, you will see example code that you can use in the notebook editor of your choice in SageMaker Studio. To deploy using the SDK, we start by selecting the Mistral Nemo Base model, specified by the model_id with the value huggingface-vlm-mistral-pixtral-12b-2409. You can deploy your choice of any of the selected models on SageMaker with the following code: This deploys the model on SageMaker with default configurations, including the default instance type and default VPC configurations. You can change these configurations by specifying non-default values in JumpStartModel. The end-user license agreement (EULA) value must be explicitly defined as True in order to accept the EULA. Also, make sure that you have the account-level service limit for using ml.p4d.24xlarge or ml.pde.24xlarge for endpoint usage as one or more instances. To request a service quota increase, refer to AWS service quotas. After you deploy the model, you can run inference against the deployed endpoint through the SageMaker predictor. In this section, we provide examples of inference on Pixtral 12B with example prompts. We use the following image as input for OCR. We use the following prompt: For chart understanding and analysis, we use the following image as input. We use the following prompt: We get the following output: For an image-to-code example, we use the following image as input. We use the following prompt: After you are done, delete the SageMaker endpoints using the following code to avoid incurring unnecessary costs: In this post, we showed you how to get started with Mistral’s newest multi-modal model, Pixtral 12B, in SageMaker JumpStart and deploy the model for inference. We also explored how SageMaker JumpStart empowers data scientists and ML engineers to discover, access, and deploy a wide range of pre-trained FMs for inference, including other Mistral AI models, such as Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x22B. For more information about SageMaker JumpStart, refer to Train, deploy, and evaluate pretrained models with SageMaker JumpStart and Getting started with Amazon SageMaker JumpStart to get started.

The stock's worst day of 2024 had been a 5.4% decline in May. The shares are still up about 69% for the year, which would be the best annual performance since the dot-com boom of 1999. After the close Monday, Oracle reported adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal second quarter of $1.47, trailing analysts' average estimate by a penny, according to LSEG. Revenue rose 9% from a year earlier to $14.06 billion, missing the $14.1 billion average estimate. Net income increased 26% to $3.15 billion, or $1.10 a share, from $2.5 billion, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in Oracle's cloud services business jumped 12% from a year earlier to $10.81 billion, accounting for 77% of total revenue. "A bit of a stumble here for a stock that's created some lofty expectations for itself," wrote analysts at KeyBank Capital Markets in a note after the report on Monday. They still recommend buying the stock and said "we still like oracle heading into 2025." For the current quarter, Oracle expects revenue growth of 7% to 9%. At the midpoint of that range, revenue would be about $14.3 billion. Analysts were expecting sales of $14.65 billion, according to LSEG. The company said it expects adjusted earnings of $1.50 to $1.54 per share. Analysts were calling for earnings per share of $1.57. Oracle's biggest growth engine has been cloud infrastructure, where it is competing with Amazon, Microsoft and Google as businesses move workloads out of their own data centers. The business is booming due to soaring demand for computing power that can handle artificial intelligence projects. Oracle said revenue in its cloud infrastructure unit surged 52% from a year earlier to $2.4 billion.Oracle said it just signed an agreement with Meta, allowing the social media company to use its infrastructure to help with various projects related to the Llama family of large language models. "Oracle Cloud Infrastructure trains several of the world's most important generative AI models because we are faster and less expensive than other clouds," Oracle founder Larry Ellison said in a statement. Analysts at Piper Sandler raised their price target on the stock to $210 from $185 "based on continued cloud momentum." They cited Oracle's cRPO (current remaining performance obligations) growth of 20%. That figures points to contracted revenue that has yet to be booked.

Larry Ellison, Oracle’s billionaire co-founder, had his net worth cut by $15 billion Tuesday as the company’s stock paced its worst loss in nearly a year, after a recent earnings report that fell short of estimates, though analysts remained optimistic about the database software firm. Analysts remained optimistic about the database software firm despite a recent earnings report. Oracle’s shares fell by more than 7% to below $177 as of around 11:40 a.m. EST, the biggest plunge for the stock since Dec. 12, 2023. The value of Ellison’s roughly 42% stake in Oracle—totaling more than 1.1 billion shares—decreased from $218.2 billion at Monday’s close to $203 billion Tuesday. On Monday, Oracle reported $14.06 billion in second-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share of $1.47, both of which fell just below analyst projections of $14.1 billion and $1.48 per share, respectively, according to FactSet. Despite missing estimates, analysts indicated Oracle’s cloud business will likely fuel its growth: Of the 38 analysts surveyed by FactSet, none lowered their stock price target for Oracle and 14 raised their projections, including some that have the stock returning close to its record intraday high of $198 set on Monday. Revenue from Oracle’s cloud services rose 12% year-over-year to $10.81 billion, accounting for 77% of total revenue, the company said. Investment firm D.A. Davidson said in a note Tuesday that Oracles’ cloud infrastructure “remains heightened” as demand for AI-based computing continues to grow.

Ellison is the world’s third-richest person with an estimated net worth of $220 billion, which decreased by about 6% on Tuesday. Oracle’s chairman ranks behind Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, currently the second-wealthiest in the world, though the two have traded ranks multiple times in recent months. Bezos’ fortune increased by nearly 1% ($2.4 billion) to $242.3 billion Tuesday as Amazon shares rose slightly. 83%. That’s how much Oracle’s shares increased this year as of Monday’s share price of $190.45. Oracle, a database software firm co-founded by Ellison, has succeeded this year alongside a rising demand for AI-based technology. Earlier this year, Deutsche Bank analysts said Oracle achieved a “triple crown” after reaching partnerships with cloud computing giants Google, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services. Oracle also recently signed an agreement with Meta, allowing the social media firm to use Oracle’s cloud infrastructure to help with projects related to Meta’s Llama language models. Oracle raised its guidance for its 2026 fiscal year in September, saying the company expects to generate about $66 billion in revenue shortly after announcing the company would take orders for “computing clusters” built with Nvidia’s GPUS. The product was touted by Oracle as the “largest AI supercomputer in the cloud.” One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

GERMANY - 2024/12/01: In this photo illustration, a Meta Platforms Inc. logo seen displayed on a ... [+] monitor. (Photo Illustration by Valera Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) META Platforms stock (NASDAQ: META) is up 5% in a month, with investor optimism around the TikTok ban. A federal appeals court recently upheld a law requiring TikTok’s owner ByteDance to find a new owner for its U.S. operations, outside of China, by January 19, 2025, or face a ban. If TikTok were to be banned in the U.S., it would have been a positive for Meta, with less competition in the social media space. See how two other tech stocks compare in Salesforce vs. Oracle Stock. Even if we were to look at a slightly longer term, META stock has outperformed, with 83% returns since early 2022 — rising from levels of $335 then to around $620 now — vs. an increase of 28% for the broader S&P 500 index over this period. This 83% growth can be attributed to: Let’s dive deeper into these factors. Separately, check out our take on EBAY – Sell LULU Stock, Buy EBAY? Meta Platforms is the world’s most popular social network that helps people connect with family and friends. The company makes money primarily through advertising, which it provides to advertisers by targeting specific demographics based on information posted by users on its platforms. Meta Platforms’ revenue has risen 32.5% from $118 billion in 2021 to $156 billion for the last twelve month period. This can be attributed to rising ad impressions as well as an increase in the average price per ad. Also, Meta’s family daily active people have risen 17% from 2.82 billion in 2021 to 3.29 billion now. Most of the company’s revenue comes from ad sales on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. The company is benefiting from its AI push, targeting more advertising. The company plans to use AI to generate more content. Not only has the company’s sales risen in the last three years, its net income margin has expanded from 33.4% in 2021 to 35.6% now. Meta’s shares outstanding also declined by 8% over this period, thanks to the $122 billion the company spent on share repurchases. Higher revenues clubbed with margin expansion and fewer shares resulted in the company’s bottom line of $21.17 now, up 54% from $13.77 in 2021. Investors have rewarded Meta stock lately, as the rise in both ad impressions and average price per ad bodes well for the company’s sales. Furthermore, the company’s AI push is expected to help it generate higher advertising revenues, with an increase in user engagement and more effective targeting. Furthermore, what may go well for Meta is the TikTok ban in the U.S. But, ByteDance has recently filed an emergency motion with an appeals court seeking a temporary block on the ban from taking effect. [1] Meta stock declined nearly 2% after the news report of TikTok filing an emergency motion emerged. At its current levels of $615, META stock is up a solid 74% this year. However, the increase in META stock over the recent years has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 23% in 2021, -64% in 2022, and 194% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could META face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? From a valuation perspective, we think META is fully valued now. We estimate Meta Platforms’ valuation to be $560 per share, slightly below the current market price. META stock is now trading at 29x trailing earnings of $21.17 per share. This compares with the stock’s average P/E ratio of 22x over the last four years. Although a slight rise in valuation multiple for META makes sense given the solid advertising growth lately, investors should take into account the risks. It’s still unclear how significant a boost AI can be for the company’s earnings growth, which makes the continued aggressive investments in AI a slight risk. While META stock looks fully valued, it is helpful to see how Meta Platform’s peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: Lisa Su

Time Published: 2024-12-10T14:02:00Z

Lisa Su apologizes if she seems tired. It’s the day after the U.S. presidential election, and like much of the nation she was awake until the early hours, transfixed as the results came in, only tearing herself away once it became clear that Donald Trump had won. “I wanted to know,” Su explains as she takes her place at the head of a conference table in the Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). “It’s relevant information.” The identity of the next President is pertinent news to most of America’s CEOs, but few more so than the leader of a top semiconductor company. Semiconductors, or chips, are the engines of our computers, phones, cars, internet services, and—increasingly—our artificial intelligence (AI) programs. The relentless rise of the chip over the past seven decades has grown economies, transformed lives, and helped cement the U.S., where most chips get their start, as the globe’s postwar hegemon. AMD is one of the world’s leading designers of the CPU chips that power both personal computers and data centers, the vast warehouses of servers that make possible the likes of Google, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft. It’s also a top designer of graphics processing units, or GPUs, the specialized chips used to create and run AI programs like ChatGPT. When you send an email, stream a movie, buy something online, or chat with an AI assistant, chances are an AMD chip is providing some of the computing power needed to make that happen. In November, a supercomputer that runs on AMD chips displaced another AMD-based machine to become the world’s most powerful. Which is thanks in large part to Su’s leadership. When she became CEO a decade ago, AMD stock was languishing around $3, its share of the data-center chip market had fallen so far that executives rounded it down to zero, and the question on everybody’s lips was how long the company had left. An engineer by training, Su spearheaded a bottom-up redesign of AMD’s products, ­repaired ­relationships with customers, and rode the AI boom to new heights. In 2022 the company’s overall value surpassed its historical rival ­Intel’s for the first time. AMD stock now trades at around $140, a nearly 50-fold increase since Su took over. This fall, Harvard Business School began teaching Su’s stewardship of AMD as a case study. “It really is one of the great turnaround stories of modern American business history,” says Chris Miller, a historian of the semiconductor industry and the author of Chip War. Purchase prints of this issue's covers here in the TIME Cover Store and click here to buy your copy of the Person of the Year issue For all its progress, AMD remains the semiconductor industry’s distant No. 2. As Su’s team was speeding past Intel, both companies were lapped by Nvidia, run by Su’s cousin Jensen Huang, which in two years has risen from industry also-ran to become the most valuable company in the world. Nvidia got a jump on its rivals by realizing that its chips, initially made for rendering graphics, happened to be perfectly suited for training neural networks, the programs that underpin modern AI. Of the $32 billion worth of AI data-center GPUs sold in the third quarter of 2024, ­Nvidia’s accounted for some 95%. In November, AMD announced that it would lay off 4% of its global workforce in what it framed as a restructuring to focus on the opportunities from AI. Meanwhile, big tech customers, like Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon, are now designing their own specialized chips for AI workloads, which could reduce their reliance on AMD products. And AMD’s continued growth relies on a host of factors outside its control: continued progress in AI; the security of Taiwan, where the vast majority of its top chips are manufactured; and the actions of a notoriously unpredictable U.S. President. Trump’s return to the White House will bring new turbulence to an industry that has barely caught its breath from a half-­decade of geopolitical showdowns, shortages, and an AI-fueled market boom. A lot rides on Su’s ability to steer the company through these obstacles. People who know her describe Su as a shrewd strategist who invests in talented people and jettisons those who aren’t pulling their weight. “I don’t believe leaders are born. I believe leaders are trained,” she tells TIME, ahead of a strategy meeting where she delivers blunt feedback to her executives and urges them to move faster and delegate more. Su, 55, holds meetings on weekends and is known among her executives for wanting to talk on morning calls about the finer points of long documents that were circulated after midnight. When prototype chips get delivered from the factory, she often personally goes down to the lab to help scrutinize them. It’s a hard-­charging style that isn’t for everyone and makes it difficult for people who don’t meet their commitments to survive at the company, according to Patrick Moorhead, a tech-industry analyst and a former AMD ­executive who left before she joined. The potential for artificial intelligence to transform science, health care, and the world of work hinges on access to a diverse supply of chips. In the brewing cold war between the U.S. and China, semiconductors are among the most vital battlegrounds. And America’s economic success—as measured by its stock market, at least—depends now more than ever on the continued growth of companies that design, produce, and utilize chips. Allies say Su is up to the task. “We couldn’t have a person better qualified for this job,” says Jerry Sanders, the company’s 88-year-old founder and its first CEO. Does she have what it takes to beat Nvidia one day? “Not a question in my mind,” he says. In October 2014, Forrest Norrod was sitting in his car at a McDonald’s drive-­through when he got a phone call from Su. Norrod had just quit his job as an executive at Dell, intending to take some time off. Su wanted to pitch him on joining AMD, where she had just been appointed CEO. While Norrod waited for his Quarter Pounder with cheese, he listened to her vision for the struggling company. By the next day, he was at AMD’s Austin headquarters, weighing the opportunity to lead its server business. Norrod had seen how the pace of innovation in the cloud-­chip industry had dropped off once AMD had allowed Intel to dominate the market, and believed that customers were paying the price. He got a sense that Su was a leader with a rare combination of traits: a technical background, business acumen, and people skills. He accepted the job. Su was born in Taiwan and moved to the U.S. at age 3, when the family immigrated so her father could attend graduate school. She grew up in New York City and discovered a love of STEM subjects at an early age, growing fascinated by the ability to write rudimentary programs on her Commodore 64 computer. She fondly recalls creating, at the science-­focused high school she attended in the Bronx, a project in which she simulated a hurricane inside a box, complete with boiling water and windows through which to watch the maelstrom. She chose to major in electrical engineering at MIT after determining that it was the most difficult option—and eventually earned her Ph.D. in the subject. It was at MIT that Su first experienced a semiconductor lab, where she was taken by the idea that such a tiny piece of hardware could carry so much mathematical firepower. She spent the first years of her career at Texas Instruments and IBM, two first-wave tech titans, which taught her about how to run a business and manage teams. “I was really lucky early in my career,” she says. “Every two years, I did a different thing.” She accepted a VP job at AMD in 2012, and by 2014 had ­ascended to CEO. “I felt like I was in training for the opportunity to do something meaningful in the semiconductor industry,” she says. “And AMD was my shot.” Su took over an indebted firm that had fired 25% of its staff, sold and leased back its Austin office, and spun off its expensive chip factories. It was a moment of change for the tech industry writ large. Smartphones and tablets were ascendant. Consumer PCs, AMD’s main market, were in decline. “It didn’t look at the time that Lisa was ­really set up for success,” says Stacy Rasgon, a chip-­industry analyst. “She was handed a tough situation.” Su’s turnaround plan had three steps: build great products, focus on customer relationships, and simplify the business. Some AMD board members wanted to pivot toward making low-power processors for phones. Su rejected that approach. “We needed to bet on what we were good at,” she says. What AMD was good at was building ­powerful processors. Su set a goal for her engineers: to build a new CPU chip that was 40% faster than the previous generation’s. And she started a team on an even more ambitious project: to explore how to develop a chip for the world’s first exascale super­computer, a machine capable of carrying out 1 quintillion operations per second. The decisions revealed a core tenet of Su’s leadership philosophy. “People are really motivated by ambitious goals,” she says. “The previous strategy of, hey, let’s just do a little bit better here and there—that’s actually less motivational.” The problem was that Su’s plans would take years to come to fruition. In the meantime, AMD was still on the ropes. “My job as a CEO was to give the engineers time to do the work,” Su says. She inked deals with console manufacturers that won AMD the revenue it needed to keep afloat. In 2016, she signed another with a consortium of ­Chinese companies, licensing some of AMD’s ­designs so they could make processors for the Chinese market. That deal brought in $293 million, though it would later come back to haunt AMD. By 2017, the company was on stronger financial footing and the new flagship chip was finally ready. Engineers had redesigned the CPU from the ground up, making use of a new architecture, which the company called “chiplets.” Until then, the chip industry had mainly etched the different parts of a processor onto one piece of silicon. AMD’s innovation was to put different circuits onto individual pieces of silicon and then fuse them all together, which made manufacturing more reliable and scalable. Engineers suggested to Su that they call the new chip “Zen,” because it was designed with a balance in mind between energy efficiency and high performance. The name stuck. Meanwhile, Intel, AMD’s main competitor, was beginning to flounder. Its new cloud processors were beset by delays. When AMD’s chips hit the market, they were the best on the block. With each new generation of Zen, AMD’s share of the cloud-­CPU market grew. Today, its share of that market is 34%. When AMD’s overall valuation surpassed Intel’s in 2022, “it felt fantastic,” Norrod says. “It’s something that I don’t think anybody in the industry would have believed was possible just a few years ago.” One recent afternoon at AMD’s Santa Clara headquarters, Su was sitting with several senior executives in the CEO’s favorite corner conference room, where the offices of both Nvidia and Intel are visible through the glass. In the meeting, Su pressed her colleagues to meet engineering milestones for the specialized chips that AMD sells for use in AI data centers. “We cannot miss a beat,” Su told them. “We have negative slack. Whatever we do organizationally, we cannot slow down.” AMD is grappling with geopolitical challenges that could reshape the semiconductor industry. Today’s chips have billions of transistors, tiny gates for managing electric current. To manufacture them requires colossal machines with hundreds of thousands of specialized parts, which fire lasers at tiny droplets of molten tin to create extreme ultra­violet light that bounces through a series of multilayered mirrors and, ultimately, etches designs onto thin wafers of silicon with atomic-level accuracy. A stray particle in the machine, a half-degree fluctuation in temperature, or a nanometer-­scale vibration could each threaten a batch of chips worth millions of dollars. The process is so complex, fragile, and expensive that only one company is currently able to manufacture at scale the most cutting-edge chips designed by the likes of AMD and Nvidia: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. The industry’s most advanced chips may be conceived in Silicon Valley, but their fabrication is almost entirely outsourced to just a handful of factories on the west coast of Taiwan. Some 80 miles across the Taiwan Strait lies China, which claims the self-­governing island as its territory. Chinese President Xi Jinping has instructed his military to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027, according to U.S. intelligence assessments made public last year. And Xi has set China on a path to reduce its technological dependence on the U.S. by producing powerful chips of its own. Without Taiwanese manufacturing, the semiconductor industry would be upended and the world’s supply of advanced chips would plummet. And if Beijing's effort to become a world-leading semiconductor producer is successful, it would set up China's military and AI industry to match or outpace America’s, which many in Washington view as a national-­security threat. In this light, Su’s 2016 decision to go into business with Chinese state-backed companies looks like a misstep. Pentagon officials tried and failed to block the deal at the time, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal, which cited worries that AMD had transferred crucial know-how that could aid China’s military and domestic semiconductor ambitions. AMD denied suggestions that it had sought to evade regulatory scrutiny on the deal, saying that it had correctly briefed the Pentagon and other agencies and had received no objections, and that the Journal’s story contained “several factual errors and omissions.” At the time, there were few laws against technology transfer to China, and deeper economic integration between the two powers was viewed by many as natural. “It was a very different era,” Su says. But the music would quickly change. In 2019, the Trump Administration placed AMD’s Chinese joint venture on the “entity list” that restricts exports of critical ­technologies to foreign ­adversaries because of perceived ­security risks. In 2022, the Biden Administration passed broader export controls that made it illegal for companies like AMD and Nvidia to sell their most advanced chips to Chinese companies. Demand for specialized AI chips is so high, and their supply so constrained, that these export controls have so far had little effect on chipmakers’ bottom lines. But Trump is expected to further expand tariffs and sanctions on China, which could quickly become painful for chip companies. Some 15% of AMD’s revenue in 2023—$3.4 billion—came from the legal sale of less powerful chips to China and Hong Kong. AMD warned investors in October that its business could be adversely affected by tariffs, as well as any retaliatory measures imposed by foreign governments. If it’s any consolation for AMD’s market position, its rivals are even more exposed: in 2023, China and Hong Kong accounted for 17% of Nvidia’s revenue, and China represented 27% of Intel’s. “We want to service the entire world with our chips,” Su says. “[But] I’m certainly a believer in: we want to be the most advanced semiconductor country.” Still, AMD is incentivized to lobby against the widening of chip export controls, even if officials determine that more sanctions would be in the interests of national security. The Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group of U.S. chip companies including AMD, argues against export controls, and has spent more than $4.5 million since 2022 lobbying lawmakers in Washington, according to the watchdog OpenSecrets. “You have to run faster,” Su says of her view of the U.S.’s competition with China. She says her main goal with any lobbying is to help lawmakers make sure “that any desired policy has the desired effect,” adding, “We certainly want to be a good corporate citizen.” Inside a high-security laboratory beyond the dry hills at Silicon Valley’s ­eastern edge, a team of government scientists celebrated a major milestone in November. The machine under their care, housed in a room longer than a football field, had just achieved the official title of most powerful supercomputer in the world. If every single person on earth were to make one calculation per second, it would take them over 480 years to calculate what this supercomputer could in one minute. The machine is called El Capitan, after the massive granite rock formation in Yosemite National Park. At its heart are more than 44,000 AMD chips called accelerated processing units (APUs), which combine elements of CPUs and GPUs in the same chip. When Su heard the news that El Capitan had officially become the most powerful supercomputer in the world, she was ecstatic. “These are the days I live for,” she says. The achievement meant that the two most powerful supercomputers in the world are now powered by AMD chips. For Su, the win was about more than just bragging rights. “I personally visited the labs several times,” she says. Fulfilling her pledge to create best-in-class technology became almost an obsession, just as delivering Zen chips on time to waiting customers had been years earlier. “She’s so, so customer-centric,” says Vamsi Boppana, AMD’s senior vice president for AI. “She absolutely wants to delight, and that has served the company so well.” Su views supercomputing as the wellspring from which further AI profits will flow. The chips in El Capitan are “without a doubt, the most complex thing we’ve ever built,” she says. But they were not a single-purpose ­investment. The designs that AMD engineers used for El Capitan are already trickling down into the specialized AI chips supplied to clients like Meta and Micro­soft. The most advanced AMD chip currently on sale in the AI market, called the Instinct MI300X, is the “first cousin” of the chips inside El Capitan, says Mark ­Papermaster, AMD’s chief technology officer. That’s thanks to their chiplet-based designs, which make it relatively simple to switch in and out different components. “There is so much synergy between traditional high-­performance supercomputing and AI,” Su says. AMD always had a business in building GPUs for gaming, but after the release of ­ChatGPT in 2022, the company quickly spun up a more powerful line aimed at the data-center market. And in the past year, AMD’s projected revenue from specialized AI chip sales has leaped from essentially $0 to $5 billion, which would account for roughly 5% of that market. (Nvidia maintains a hammerlock on most of the rest.) This line of chips is now a popular choice for what’s known in the industry as AI “inference,” or the running of an already-formed AI system. For years, the easiest way to increase AI performance was by simply training bigger models on more GPU chips. But as some computer scientists report diminishing returns from that practice, companies are now turning to a different strategy: increasing the time AIs spend running ­instead—in the inference phase, rather than the training phase. That could be good news for AMD, whose inference chips are approaching parity with Nvidia’s in terms of not only speed but also energy efficiency, which matters even more when you’re running an AI over a longer period. “We do see inference as a growing piece of the market,” says Boppana. AMD is still struggling to break into the training phase of the market. That’s largely because Nvidia controls the world’s leading software for optimizing GPUs for that ­purpose—and it only works with Nvidia chips. The huge number of developers who already use it gives Nvidia an ongoing advantage. AMD is building its own competing software, but it is “absolutely behind Nvidia’s,” says Moorhead, the former AMD executive. Su says AMD is catching up. That’s partly thanks to an informal alliance with tech companies, including Meta, that want to avoid handing Nvidia an outright monopoly. Meta is buying AMD chips, contributing to AMD’s code base, and using its software in its data centers. “It’s a very good symbiotic relationship,” says Moorhead. “Without AMD, Nvidia can double their prices.” Says Su: “Nobody wants to be locked into a proprietary ecosystem. Really our strategy is: let’s invest in an open ecosystem. And then may the best chip win.” Yet in their bid to reduce their reliance on Nvidia, major AI companies have also begun to design some of their own chips in-house. That could threaten AMD in the long term. But Su doesn’t see it that way. “I actually see it as an opportunity,” she says. No company wants to replicate the $6 billion AMD pours into R&D annually, she argues. She sees instead a future where big tech companies continue to spend on AMD’s chips, while also relying on their own chips for certain workloads. “There’s no one-size-fits-all in computing,” she says. “The broader the ecosystem, the bigger the party.” If Su is right, the size of the party is going to keep on growing. She predicts the specialized AI chip market alone will grow to be worth $500 billion by 2028—more than the size of the entire semiconductor industry a decade ago. To be the No. 2 company in that market would still make AMD a behemoth. Sure, AMD won’t be overtaking Nvidia anytime soon. But Su measures her plans in decades. “When you invest in a new area, it is a five- to 10-year arc to really build out all of the various pieces,” she says. “The thing about our business is, everything takes time.” —With reporting by Leslie Dickstein and Simmone Shah Write to Billy Perrigo at billy.perrigo@time.com

Title: What will the year 2025 bring for Linux PCs?

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. The year ahead has a lot in store for Linux users. Many of the trends, hardware products, and software developments below comprise a colorful mix that focuses on the use of Linux in particular. We also include other current and future events in hardware and software that will influence or characterize everyday IT life — Linux or otherwise. The upshot is that Linux users will see a lot of change on the horizon. Raspberry Pi Foundation Since the Raspberry Pi Foundation went public in mid-2024, the future of the successful board computer has been quite uncertain. The share price has been volatile since then, but has held up reasonably well overall. The fresh millions on the stock market open up opportunities for technical innovations for the mini-computer, but on the other hand the project is moving away from its non-profit origins. Nothing concrete is currently known about future models, but prices will be higher than before. The continued production and stocking of older models, as was previously the case, could also fall victim to profit maximization. See also: 10 surprisingly practical Raspberry Pi projects anybody can do The Gnome 47 and KDE Plasma 6 desktops are forcing the switch to the Wayland display protocol by setting Wayland as the standard despite some remaining detail problems. Most Linux distributions with these desktops (Fedora, Ubuntu, Kubuntu, KDE Neon, Endeavour, et cetera) will follow this specification in 2025. The fact remains, however, that apart from Gnome and KDE, only the niche desktop Enlightenment (current version E20) is aggressively pushing for Wayland. The Gnome-like Budgie desktop, as well as Cinnamon (Linux Mint) and Mate, still offer Wayland as an “experimental” option. XFCE (announced for the upcoming version 4.20) and LXQT are just starting their Wayland conversion. Cinnamon running in Wayland. Linux Mint The replacement of the old X11 window system will obviously continue well beyond 2025. This is a stumbling block, not least because every Wayland operation currently still has to drag along the Xwayland mediation layer in order to be able to display older X11 windows. The current Gnome 47 is the first Linux desktop that is at least technically prepared to completely dispense with Xwayland in the future. Debian A new Debian version is released approximately every two years. After version 12 “Bookworm,” which was released in 2023, Debian 13 (“Trixie”) is due in 2025. With Debian “Forky,” the name for version 14 has already been decided. Debian 13 will continue to offer a variant for 32-bit processors, but no longer for very old i386 CPUs, but at least from i686 onwards. i686 CPUs are also ancient processors such as Pentium Pro, Pentium II, Pentium III, and some early Pentium 4 models. The oldest of these CPUs are over 25 years old and date back to the 20th century. Regardless of Debian’s 32-bit continuity, the recycling of such oldies is usually unsatisfactory. New Debian is always immensely important because many derivatives are based on Debian and must also be updated as a result — such as Antix, Bunsenlabs, Kanotix, MX Linux, Linux Mint Debian, Ope Media Vault, Pi-OS, Rescuezilla, Sparky, Q4-OS, Tails, and many more (Ubuntus!). Ubuntu After April 2025, there will be no more update support for Ubuntu 20.04, unless you have taken out the 10-year ESM (Expanded Security Maintenance) support with Ubuntu Pro. On devices with version 20.04, you will then either have to reinstall or make up for several upgrade stages. A new installation with the current LTS version Ubuntu 24.04 is particularly recommended for systems that work as servers. After 14 October 2025, Microsoft will no longer offer free updates for Windows 10 and technical support will be discontinued (EOL, End of Life). As a simple upgrade to Windows 11 will fail for many laptops and PCs due to the high hardware requirements, a significant wave of users switching to Linux desktops can be expected over the course of the next year. Last year’s Linux growth to a market share of around 4.5 percent is probably already linked to this Windows date. Unicon is launching the eLux operating system for companies. The system is designed to combine security, hardware flexibility, and performance. The download requires registration with an email address. Windows 10 will be discontinued on 1 October 2025. If Windows 11 does not run on the hardware, any (even more demanding) Linux will run. Anton Watman/Shutterstock.com Experience has shown that Linux distributions are generally too fragmented to make concerted and aggressive use of the opportunities offered by the Windows runtime. Only some of the typical Windows detractors such as Linux Mint or Zorin-OS will refer to their Windows-like concepts and optimize them. In addition, most tried-and-tested Linux desktops (mostly Debian/Ubuntu-based, in some cases also Arch-based) are also suitable as Windows 10 alternatives. See also: 3 free Linux distros that look and feel like Windows Open Suse Leap 16.0, the successor to Leap 15.6, is not expected until mid-2025 at the earliest. Version 16 aims to end the technical continuity with the previous Leap, but at least promises the possibility of a direct upgrade to Leap 16. If necessary, an interim version 15.7 will be added. openSUSE Open Suse Leap 16 will be an “immutable” Linux. Suse is developing its own Adaptable Linux Platform (ALP) architecture with a write-protected base system that increases security and stability. The required software is to be provided by isolated containers — presumably flatpaks. With its focus on cloud systems and automated system management, Open Suse Leap 16 is likely to follow the trend of recent years. The Suse system is becoming increasingly uninteresting for the needs of a flexible end-user desktop. The same applies to Fedora Workstation, which in the Silverblue “Immutable” version is signalling the path that Fedora generally wants to take. The security and maintenance advantages of the immutable concept are aimed at cloud and server instances and mainly have disadvantages on the desktop. Nix It is perhaps not necessarily the Linux distribution Nix-OS itself, but its concept of “declarative configuration,” which probably has a great future ahead of it. Nix-OS uses a central configuration file as a meta-level. This allows the entire system to be reproduced identically (e.g. for cloud and server instances), but can also be reset to previous system states (relevant for servers and desktops). Package dependencies are avoided because — similar to container formats — software is always stored separately with all dependencies. The concept requires a lot of storage space and the adoption of completely customized methods for package installations and updates. Cloud providers are already in the thick of it, but Nix-OS should still provide some additional convenience features for desktop users. While Microsoft has included the sudo tool as an option for developers in Windows 10/11 in 2024, leading Linux developers want to abolish sudo or offer a better alternative. The new run0 tool is already available in the latest versions of the Systemd init system. IDG In future Linux distributions, run0 will certainly not immediately replace the familiar sudo, but will at best run as an alternative for the time being. The run0 tool has several advantages over sudo: In principle, it requires no configuration, whereas sudo requires the not entirely uncomplicated “/etc/ sudoer.” run0 is based on Polkit, whose individual configuration is not simpler, but is usually unnecessary. As run0 loads an isolated systemd target, it is more secure than sudo, which relies on rights masks in the file system (SUID bit). In addition, run0 gives visual signals in the terminal and window title to indicate the current elevated permissions. We have barely gotten used to the new term IoT (Internet of Things) when the next “internet” is added. IoB — Internet of Behavior — is more or less a consequence of IoT: the Internet of Things with smartwatches, webcams, health trackers, sensors, measuring stations, and smart home devices expands the data material that websites and apps collect through direct communication. IoT provides masses of additional data that can be analyzed statistically (trends, anomalies, causalities). These IoB statistics and behavioral analysis are not only driven by the retail and advertising industries: IoB can provide insurance companies, health insurance companies, traffic planners, the police, and entrepreneurs with interesting information and correlations that do not necessarily have to be personalized. It is not yet clear which IoB analysis will become part of everyday life in the future. Data protectionists are already warning that there is a lack of transparent user consent for data collection. In the context of the growing customs dispute between the USA, EU, and China, Huawei is preparing to say goodbye to Windows operating systems on its laptops. In the future, the Chinese manufacturer intends to offer its self-developed Harmony OS operating system. Harmony OS is based on its own Linux-independent (Hongmeng) kernel. The operating system was previously only planned for Huawei smartphones, but will also be available for laptops in the future. Huawei laptops will run Harmony OS from mid-2025. Microsoft is thus losing a major Windows customer. Huawei Harmony OS is said to perform better than Linux desktops. It is entirely plausible that the Chinese IT giant can achieve this for the hardware it produces itself. However, compatibility with software is problematic. It is not yet clear to what extent Harmony OS will also offer customized standard software or integrate it via a translation layer. Potential buyers of the attractively priced Huawei laptops should consider this question carefully. TP-Link Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) is five years old, many older routers and devices still work with 802.11ac or even older 802.11n. From 2024, there will be more and more devices with radio chips of the new Wi-Fi generation 7 (802.11be). The Linux kernel is prepared for this — from version 6.5 to be precise. Wi-Fi 7 will not only significantly increase data throughput, but will also use MLO (Multi-Link Operation) to communicate across multiple radio bands between the transmitter and receiver devices. This improves both throughput and stability. New DDR5 RAM modules with higher speeds and lower latency will come onto the market in 2025. However, DDR6 is already on the runway: The next generation of DDR RAM is not due to be released until the end of 2025 at the earliest. DDR6 will again be significantly faster than current DDR5 RAM. The specification speaks of at least 8800 MT/s (megatransfers per second) for the first DDR6 generation, which is roughly double that of DDR5. Later DDR6 components should then achieve up to 21,000 MT/s. G.Skill Innovative graphics formats have been flourishing in photography and imaging for years, but they have been very slow to catch on. While all browsers and many image editing applications now support the Google Webp format, the Apple HEIF/HEIC format and the JPEG successor JPEG XL still need help from add-ons for software or additional packages for the system on many systems and image viewers. REDPIXEL.PL The High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF) is favored by iPhones for photos. HEIC is the associated container format that also stores image sequences, comments, and audio in addition to (HEIF) images. JPEG XL (jxl) is the designated successor to the long-standing JPG standard. In 2025, it is expected that all Linux distributions will increasingly prepare their viewers and file managers for these formats. Experience has shown that the question of which image format will prevail is obsolete: There will simply be a few more in the future, while JPG, PNG, and others will continue to exist. There is no question that there will be no standstill in CPU development in 2025. AMD will introduce new Ryzen CPUs such as “Kraken” and Intel is planning Panther Lake processors based on its latest production technology (18A). The goals are the same — more performance, more efficiency. Alexander56891 / Shutterstock.com Regardless of new CPU records, the new (marketing) term “AI PC” or Copilot PC (Microsoft) will come into focus. In this product class, which performs AI functions on the local device, a fast CPU is not enough — at least a dedicated GPU graphics chip (preferably Nvidia), plenty of DDR5 RAM, and a fast SSD are also required. The more obvious feature that distinguishes an AI PC from a gaming PC or a powerful workstation is the additional NPU chip (Neural Processing Unit). NPUs cannot process AI models any better or faster than the GPU, but they are much more energy-efficient. In other words: computer bolides are AI-capable, but only energy-efficient with an additional NPU. Processors with an NPU extension already exist — from Intel (Lunar Lake), AMD (Ryzen AI), and Qualcomm (Snapdragon). However, it is not yet clear how future-proof these first NPUs are. See also: The AI PC revolution: 18 essential terms you need to know Mass storage devices are experiencing continuous capacity growth every year. New records are on the horizon for 2025: SSD: The maximum capacity of SSDs is expected to increase from the current maximum of around 60TB to 128TB by mid-2025, more than doubling. This has been announced by several manufacturers such as Western Digital, Huawei, and Samsung. Mechanical drives: The classic hard drive is reaching its technical limits and has already seen its greatest leaps in capacity. However, the current maximum of 24- to 32TB should be able to be increased again in future thanks to new HAMR technology (Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording). Seagate is announcing drives with 40TB for 2025, and up to 60- or 80TB by the end of the decade. Jon L. Jacobi NVMe SSD: Capacities of up to 16TB are expected for M.2 NVMe storage on the PCI Express bus by 2025. This means a doubling of the currently largest NVMe SSDs. For end users, the record capacities are hardly relevant and generally hardly affordable. More important is the market law that with new, faster, and larger media, the prices for smaller and medium capacities will fall. USB 4 is the joint successor to USB 3.2 and Thunderbolt 3 with a theoretical maximum throughput of 40Gbps (approx. 5GB/s). USB 4v2 (also “USB 4.0 Gen 4” and more recently “USB4 2.0”) theoretically achieves 80- or 120Gbps. The first controllers and drives of this generation are already on the market. Drivers for USB 4v2 are included in the current Linux kernel. This article originally appeared on our sister publication PC-WELT and was translated and localized from German.

U.S. stock futures are little changed after markets stepped back from record highs on tech sector jitters; GameStop (GME) reports earnings after markets close today; Oracle (ORCL) shares drop as the tech firm’s revenue comes in lower than expected; European regulators reportedly are seeking information from Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google on its advertising program targeting teens on Meta Platforms' (META) Instagram; and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) posts strong November sales, showing that AI demand remains strong for the Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) supplier. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are little changed after major indexes began the week on a down note, due in part to weakness in the tech sector. Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures are ticking higher, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are pointing marginally lower. Investors are preparing to digest more earnings reports today and watching for inflation data later this week. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is slightly lower at around $97,000, while gold futures are 0.6% higher. Oil futures are 0.5% lower and yields on the 10-year Treasury note are slightly higher at above 4.2%. GameStop (GME) shares are edging lower in premarket trading ahead of the video game retailer's third-quarter earnings report after markets close today. The report comes after the stock briefly surged last week after a cryptic social media post by meme-stock hero Keith "Roaring Kitty" Gill evidently inspired some investors to buy in. GameStop stock is not widely followed by Wall Street analysts, with the one analyst tracked by Visible Alpha giving it an "underperform" rating and $10 price target, well below the $27.93 price shares closed at on Monday. Oracle (ORCL) stock is sinking 6% in premarket trading after the tech firm reported quarterly revenue that missed analysts' expectations. The cloud services giant, whose shares hit record highs last week on enthusiasm over artificial intelligence (AI) demand, reported revenue of $14.06 billion, up 9% year-over-year but below Visible Alpha estimates. Net income of $3.15 billion or $1.10 per share, up from $2.5 billion or 89 cents per share a year earlier, beat estimates. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.47 slightly missed expectations. European regulators are seeking more information from Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google about the secret advertising partnership the search giant had with Instagram parent Meta Platforms (META), the Financial Times reported. The deal, which has since been ended, targeted Instagram advertisements to teenagers on YouTube, circumventing Google's rules barring personalized ads to those under 18. Shares of both Alphabet and Meta Platforms are higher in premarket trading. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) posted a 34% year-over-year jump in November sales, a signal that demand for AI-focused chips remains strong for the Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) supplier. The company reported November sales of 276.06 billion New Taiwan dollars ($8.48 billion), down 12% from October's figures, while revenue between January and November has jumped 32% year-over-year. U.S.-listed shares of TSMC, the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, are falling about 1% in premarket trading but have almost doubled this year.

December 10, 2024 06:55 ET | Source: YieldMax YieldMax CHICAGO and MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Dec. 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax™ announced the launch today of the following ETF: YieldMax™ MARA Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSE Arca: MARO) MARO seeks to generate current income by pursuing options-based strategies on MARA Holdings, Inc. (MARA). MARO is actively managed by ZEGA Financial. MARO does not invest directly in MARA. MARO is the newest member of the YieldMax™ ETF family and like all YieldMax™ ETFs, aims to deliver current income to investors. With respect to distributions, MARO will be a Group B ETF and its first distribution is expected to be announced on January 2, 2025. Please see table below for distribution information for all outstanding YieldMax™ ETFs. The performance data quoted above represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted above. Performance current to the most recent month-end can be obtained by calling (833) 378-0717. Note: CRSH, FIAT, DIPS and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs” and “ADR” stands for American Depositary Receipt. Distributions are not guaranteed. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from month to month and may be zero. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). Prospectuses Click here. Before investing you should carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other information are in the prospectus. Please read the prospectuses carefully before you invest. There is no guarantee that any Fund’s investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment in any such Fund. Tidal Financial Group is the adviser for all YieldMax™ ETFs and ZEGA Financial is their sub-adviser. THE FUND, TRUST, AND SUB-ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERNCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) YMAX and YMAG generally invest in other YieldMax™ ETFs. As such, these two Funds are subject to the risks listed in this section, which apply to all the YieldMax™ ETFs they may hold from time to time. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer time periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given month. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund’s expenses. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR, MARA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosure (applicable only to MARO) Digital Assets Risk: The Fund does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than the Fund. Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer time periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given month. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given time period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Title: Salesforce vs. Oracle Stock

Time Published: 2024-12-10T09:00:00Z

The Salesforce logo appears on the screen of a smartphone in Reno, United States, on November 29, ... [+] 2024. (Photo by Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Given its better valuation, we believe that Salesforce stock (NYSE: CRM) is currently a better pick over its peer, Oracle stock. CRM stock trades at 9.5x trailing revenues, versus 9.8x for ORCL. Although Oracle is more profitable, Salesforce has seen better revenue growth and it offers lower financial risk. There is more to the comparison, and in the sections below, we discuss why we think CRM will outperform ORCL in the next three years. We compare a slew of factors, such as historical revenue growth, returns, and valuation. ORCL stock has seen strong gains of 225% from levels of $60 in early January 2021 to around $195 now, vs. an increase of about 65% for CRM stock from $220 to $360. This compares with roughly 60% gains for the S&P 500 over this four-year period. Admirably, ORCL stock has outperformed the broader market in each of the last four years. Returns for the stock were 37% in 2021, -5% in 2022, 31% in 2023, and 85% so far in 2024. CRM stock hasn’t been that consistent, with returns of 14% in 2021, -48% in 2022, 98% in 2023, and 38% this year – indicating that CRM underperformed the S&P in 2021 and 2022. Separately, for another strong stock this year see What’s Behind The 80% Rise In Meta Stock? In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 — in good times and bad — has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for heavyweights in the Information Technology sector including META, COMM, and AAPL, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, TSLA, and MSFT. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Salesforce has seen its revenue rise at an average annual rate of 18.1% from $21.3 billion in 2021 to $34.9 billion in 2024 (fiscal ends in January). On the other hand, Oracle’s average revenue growth rate of 9.5% from $40.5 billion in 2021 to $53 billion in 2024 (fiscal ends in May) over this period has been comparatively slower. Salesforce’s revenue growth lately has been driven by an increase in subscription and support sales, amid increased demand for its cloud-based offerings, including – Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and Marketing Cloud. Salesforce aims to grow its revenues by leveraging the technological revolution that includes the demand for artificial intelligence and machine learning. The company is benefiting from its AI system – Agentforce. The company continues to introduce AI capabilities across its offerings, which is resulting in increased adoption. Oracle’s revenue growth is also being driven by increased consumption of its cloud offerings. Oracle is benefiting from its success with generative AI workloads. In fact, it expects its revenue to double in five years, as more on-site database customers move to the cloud. As an aside, check out Sell LULU Stock, Buy eBay? Looking forward, both Salesforce and Oracle are expected to benefit from the rising demand for cloud and AI. Oracle is investing in AI infrastructure and has partnered with key players, including AWS, Microsoft, and Google. We expect both companies to see their sales rise at a low double-digit average annual growth rate over the next three years. Looking at profitability, Oracle’s adjusted net income margin has declined from 34.9% in 2021 to 29.7% in 2024, while that for Salesforce has risen from 21.6% to 23.2% over this period. Now, Oracle’s 30.3% adjusted net income margin for the last twelve-month period fares much better than 25.5% for Salesforce. From a financial risk perspective, Salesforce seems to have an edge over Oracle. Its 3% debt as a percentage of equity is much lower than 16% for Oracle, while its 14% cash a percentage of assets is higher than 8% for the latter. This implies that Salesforce has a better debt position and more cash cushion. We see that Salesforce has seen better revenue growth and it offers lower financial risk. On the other hand, Oracle is more profitable. Now, looking at prospects, we believe CRM is the better choice of the two. At its current levels of $360, CRM stock is trading at 37x its trailing adjusted earnings of $9.70 per share, compared to the stock’s average P/E ratio of 43x over the last four years. In comparison, at its current levels of around $190, ORCL stock trades at 32x its trailing adjusted earnings of $5.77 per share, versus the stock’s average P/E ratio of 22x over the last four years. We think that an upward revision in valuation multiple for both stocks is warranted, given the rising AI-based cloud demand. ORCL stock, trading at a valuation multiple much higher than its historical average, while CRM stock trading at a multiple lower than historical average, doesn’t make sense in our view. We think this gap will narrow in favor of CRM. While both stocks may offer robust gains in the long term, if one has to pick, we believe CRM is a better choice. While CRM may outperform ORCL in the next three years, it is helpful to see how Salesforce’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

(Bloomberg) -- Baillie Gifford & Co., known for investing in hyper-growth tech stocks, now likes “boring” US infrastructure companies as it sees a building boom after many years of under-investment. Most Read from Bloomberg Brace for a Nationwide Shuffle of Corporate Headquarters A Chicago Skyscraper Cements the Legacy of a Visionary Postmodern Architect Cloud Computing Tax Threatens Chicago’s Silicon Valley Ambitions NYC’s Run-Down Bus Terminal Gets Approval for $10 Billion Revamp Kansas City Looks Back on its Long, Costly Ride With Microtransit “We think there’s going to be a massive building boom certainly in the US, the UK and in some other places,” Stuart Dunbar, a partner at the Edinburgh-based firm, told Bloomberg in Tokyo. Baillie Gifford still likes some US big tech stocks but is underweight on many of them now because of high valuations, he said. “In parts of Europe and in the US, the infrastructure is just falling apart. It’s been under-invested for 50 years and it’s getting to the point where it can’t be ignored any longer, with bridges falling down literally,” Dunbar said. “It’s quite an unexpected source of growth, like building aggregates suppliers, drainage systems providers,” he said, mentioning companies such as Advanced Drainage Systems Inc. and Stella-Jones Inc. as among its favorites. Baillie Gifford has been known for its big bets in large tech firms such as Tesla Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. But it’s now underweight most such US stocks — an unusual stance for the firm — despite its positive long-term view on them, Dunbar said. Investment in suppliers of water pipes and utility poles is by no means a departure from its growth stock strategy, though. “We will look wherever we need to look to try to find the companies that we think have got the ability not only to grow quickly, but to do so profitably,” Dunbar said. For tech stocks, Nvidia Corp.’s high valuation depends on continued growth, according to the investment manager. Nvidia, which makes chips used for AI data centers, trades at 34 times expected earnings, well above 23 times for the S&P 500 index. “That growth isn’t likely sustainable in the long term unless we start to see meaningful value coming through from applications of AI, so we’ve been top-slicing it,” Dunbar said, adding that Baillie Gifford still holds Nvidia and doesn’t have a negative view. Baillie Gifford is more cautious on Google parent Alphabet Inc., fretting that “AI could be a Google killer,” Dunbar said. On the other hand, it’s still a fan of Amazon because strong research and development spending allows it keep a solid competitive position. Meta also has a strong data set on which the firm can build AI capabilities, while Tesla has “incredible robotics and energy businesses” even though its rival BYD Co. “makes better cars at half the price,” he added. BYD is among China tech shares that Baillie Gifford sees coming back, despite headwinds from threats of tariffs from the US, and Europe in the case of EV makers. Elsewhere, the investment manager thinks digital banking is an important trend, betting on fintech firms such as Nu Holdings Ltd. in Brazil and Adyen NV in the Netherlands.

Title: Oracle stock is down almost 8% after earnings miss and elevated cloud expectations

Time Published: 2024-12-10T04:10:48Z

Oracle fell nearly 8% in extended trading after it reported quarterly earnings that slightly missed estimates and the company issued weaker-than-expected guidance. The software provider reported fiscal second-quarter revenue of $14.1 billion, a 9% year-on-year increase. It reported $4.21 billion in profit, or $1.47 per share, for the three months that ended in late November. Oracle's cloud services business, which has customers including OpenAI, xAI, and Nvidia, grew 12% from last year and made up 77% of the company's total quarterly revenue. Oracle said it expects revenue growth between 7% and 9% for the current quarter. This would bring revenue expectations to about $14.3 billion, below analyst estimates of $14.65 billion. The company's business is booming due to sky-high demand for computing from artificial intelligence companies seeking to train their models. Oracle's stock has surged 80% this year, boosting its market value from below $165 billion in late 2022 to north of $500 billion. The enterprise-computing giant's stock decline on Monday resulted from high expectations going into the results. Fiscal second-quarter expectations are elevated coming out of a bullish September analyst day and long-term revenue targets that imply a multi-year growth acceleration, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote in a note last week. At the analyst day in September, Oracle forecast annual revenue to rise to at least $104 billion in fiscal year 2029, a sign of its continued growth in cloud infrastructure. Investors are likely also reacting to mixed results. Key metrics include capital expenditure, which was above consensus; growth of infrastructure-as-a-service, which was in line with consensus; and growth of backlog, an Oracle product, which missed estimates. Oracle competes with Google, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft in the cloud infrastructure business. "Our cloud is faster and is less expensive than other clouds," Oracle's CEO Safra Catz said on an earnings call on Monday. "We remain the preferred cloud for AI workloads." On Monday, the company also announced a deal with Meta to use Oracle's AI cloud infrastructure to develop the social media giant's Llama AI models. Oracle's soaring stock price this year has boosted the net worth of Larry Ellison, who cofounded the company and is chief technology officer. His Oracle stock — he holds more than 40% of the company's shares — puts him third on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires list, worth $234.8 billion as of Monday. Jump to

They also awaited new U.S. inflation data set for release this week. The S&P 500 lost 0.3% to end at 6,034.91, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.25% to 19,687.24. Both indexes booked back-to-back losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined for a fourth day, sliding 154.10 points, or 0.35%, to 44,247.83. Oracle shares slumped 6.7% after the database software company posted fiscal second-quarter results that missed Wall Street's estimates. The stock has jumped around 68% this year. "[The market] has been narrowing over the past week," CFRA Research's chief investment strategist Sam Stovall said to CNBC. "Investors are waiting to see if that simply is your traditional seasonal softness in mid-December, and I think [they] are expecting the participation to broaden out once again as the market does indeed go through an end-of-year pop." Alphabet was a breakout winner of the session, advancing 5.6%, on the back of Google making a major breakthrough in quantum computing with the unveiling of its new chip. That puts its year-to-date gains at more than 32%. This comes after the major averages fell on Monday. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slid about 0.6%, dropping from recent records as shares of Nvidia declined. Shares of the chip giant were more than 2% lower Tuesday, extending losses seen in the previous session after a Chinese regulator said it was investigating the company for possibly violating the country's antimonopoly law. By contrast, Meta Platforms, which also saw losses on Monday, was up 1% Tuesday. Investors are now waiting on the U.S. consumer price index report, which is due Wednesday and could influence how the Federal Reserve proceeds on interest rates at its Dec. 17-18 meeting. Economists polled by Dow Jones forecast that headline inflation rose 0.3% in November and 2.7% over the prior 12 months. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 154.10 points, or 0.35%, to finish at 44,247.83 on Tuesday. The broad market S&P 500 also fell 0.3% to settle at 6,034.91, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.25% to finish at 19,687.24. — Sean Conlon U.S. Steel shares plunged late Tuesday afternoon on a report that President Joe Biden plans to block the company's acquisition by Japan's Nippon Steel later this month. U.S. Steel stock was briefly halted due to volatility. The company's shares were down more than 9% after trading resumed. People familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News that Biden will block the $14.1 billion sale once the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States submits its review to him by Dec. 22 or Dec. 23. — Spencer Kimball Kroger and Albertsons shares moved in opposite directions after a U.S. judge nixed the grocers' planned $25 billion merger. Kroger shares surged 4%, while Albertsons shares tumbled more than 3% and hit a 52-week low. The Biden administration had fought against the deal, arguing the combination would reduce competition and lead to higher prices at the supermarket. However, Kroger pushed back against this argument. Management claimed becoming a larger entity would result in cost savings that could then be passed on to their customers. Kroger shares have outperformed the market this year, with a 32% gain, while Albertsons shares have fallen 22%. — Christina Cheddar Berk President-elect Donald Trump's tariff plans may not go into effect for some time, according to Wolfe Research's Stephanie Roth. "We don't expect sweeping tariffs to go into effect until late 2025 — Republicans are reportedly discussing how to potentially leverage tariff revenue in a broader fiscal package, which increases the odds tariffs happen late in 2025 rather than early," the firm's chief economist wrote. If a 10% universal baseline tariff and a 60% tariff on Chinese goods coming into the U.S. were to be implemented, Roth estimates the U.S. economy will be hit up to 1.2% in gross domestic product, and inflation will see a boost of 1.1%. — Sean Conlon The market may likely see more upside over the coming weeks, according to Barclays. "Momentum seems so strong that a continued rally seems the path of least resistance for the rest of 2024," analyst Ajay Rajadhyaksha wrote in a note this week. Rajadhyaksha also said bond markets are expected to be "range-bound," given that investors are awaiting more details on President-elect Donald Trump's policies. — Sean Conlon The S&P 500 has had more declining than advancing stocks in each of the last six completed trading days, according to BTIG data. Despite that, it has been a winning period for the broad index in an unusual twist. The S&P 500 is up around 0.3% during that timeframe. There has never been a six-day run with both negative daily breadth and a positive overall return in the past two decades, according to BTIG. — Alex Harring While stocks may be due for more gains in 2025, Citi believes investors should also brace for more volatility given an uncertain policy outlook and raised valuations. "We maintain a positive view on US equities headed into 2025," the firm's U.S. equity strategist Scott Chronert wrote. "Ongoing soft landing and Artificial Intelligence tailwinds now interact with Trump policy promise, and risks. Continued broadening beyond Mega Cap Growth impacts is critical but an extended valuation starting point will be an ongoing hurdle." The strategist has a year-end 2025 base case target for the S&P 500 of 6,500, allowing for gains in the mid-single digits next year. However, his bull case of 6,900 and bear case of 5,100 allow for a broad range of outcomes. "Our bull and bear case assumptions help frame an expectation for increased volatility next year," Chronert continued. — Sean Conlon Oracle shares shed about 8% and are on pace for their worst day since Dec.12, 2023. The decline came on the heels of a disappointing fiscal second-quarter earnings report that fell short of Wall Street's estimates on the top and bottom lines. Oracle also issued a weak current-quarter outlook. The drop in shares comes as Oracle heads for its best year since 1999 as investors snatch up shares of cloud infrastructure players assisting companies with the demand storage needs for artificial intelligence models. — Samantha Subin During Tuesday's trading session, eight stocks in the S&P 500 reached new 52-week highs. Names that hit this milestone included: On the flip side, just three stocks were trading at their 52-week lows: Baxter, Centene and Teleflex. — Lisa Kailai Han, Christopher Hayes Semiconductor stocks dropped on Tuesday, putting downward pressure on the market. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) and VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) each slid more than 2%. By comparison, the S&P 500 was near flat and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite ticked up 0.2%. Among the worst-performing semi stocks was Broadcom, which slid about 4%. Micron and Taiwan Semiconductor also each dropped more than 3%. Notably, artificial intelligence darling Nvidia shed nearly 2%. — Alex Harring Shares of Alphabet rose more than 5% in afternoon trading following Google's breakthrough in quantum computing. The company said its new chip, known as Willow, is able to decrease errors "exponentially" as the amount of qubits, which are considered the units of information in quantum computing, are increased. This "cracks a key challenge in quantum error correction that the field has pursued for almost 30 years," Google also said. The stock's move brings its year-to-date gains to more than 32%. Shares have also risen more than 24% over the past three months. — Sean Conlon The dollar index rose 0.4% Tuesday to 106.58. Against the euro, the dollar gained 0.5%. The euro last traded at 1.05 against the greenback. Meanwhile, the dollar strengthened 0.6% to 152.13 yen, and climbed 0.4% against the won to 1,434.23. In December, the greenback has gained 1.6% and 2.8% against the won and the yen, respectively. — Hakyung Kim Walgreens Boots Alliance shares popped 18% in midday trading, after briefly halting for volatility, following a Wall Street Journal report, citing sources familiar, that said the pharmacy chain is in talks to sell itself to private equity firm Sycamore Partners. The deal could be completed as soon as early next year if talks don't fall apart, the report said. Sycamore Partners declined CNBC's request for comment. The move would take Walgreens off the public market after it was booted off the Dow Jones Industrial Average earlier this year. The stock is down 57% in 2024. — Sarah Min Check out the companies making headlines in midday trading: For the full list, read here. — Pia Singh There were just 209 advancers in the S&P 500, with the index itself little changed as investors awaited this week's consumer prices data. Communication services and consumer discretionary were the top-performing sectors, up 2% and 0.8%, respectively. By contrast, real estate stocks slid 1%. Boeing was the No. 1 stock in the broader index, gaining more than 5% after Reuters, citing people familiar, said the company restarted production of its 737 Max jetliner. On the other hand, Super Micro Computer and Oracle were lower by 8% and 7%, respectively. — Sarah Min The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) dipped 0.5% on Tuesday, putting the fund on track for its fourth straight losing session and sixth in the past seven, according to FactSet data. The declines have also come during the session. As Bespoke Investment Group pointed out in a post on social media site X, the RSP has seen intraday declines in six straight sessions. It would need to rally and close above $184.46 to snap that streak on Tuesday. The struggles for the RSP are notable because the equal weight fund can be a proxy for market breadth. While the S&P 500 has become increasingly concentrated in a handful of tech names over the past year, the behavior of the RSP is more indicative of the broader large cap stock universe. — Jesse Pound China-focused exchange-traded funds relinquished some gains on Tuesday, a day after the country promised "more proactive" fiscal stimulus and looser monetary policy. The iShares China Large-Cap ETF (FXI) and iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI) each slid just over 4.5% in late morning trading. The KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB) also dropped more than 4.5%. Despite those slides, all three funds are still higher compared with where they started the week. That underscores the strength of Monday's rally. — Alex Harring The Trump Trade is already running out of steam, according to Wolfe Research. "Uncertainty in the first half of 2025 should put a damper on the 'Trump Trade,'" the firm's chief investment strategist Chris Senyek wrote Tuesday. "So in the meantime we'd continue to own the Mag 7!" The Trump Trade will have three parts, Senyek wrote, with the first part unwinding in the immediate aftermath of the election. Senyek expects the second part of the trade will likely come in the first 100 days of the president-elect's term. The third, he said, will come in the second half of 2025, as incoming data indicates whether Trump's policy agenda is a positive or negative for economic growth. For now, as the first part of the Trump Trade finishes its course, Senyek said he would stick to the "Magnificent Seven" that are not in the "crosshairs of policy risk" through the first half of 2025. — Sarah Min Shares of Sirius XM slid more than 8% on Tuesday after the radio operator appointed a new chief operating officer and announced cost-cutting initiatives. The firm said it will target an initial incremental $200 million of annualized savings as it exits 2025, citing "marketplace headwinds." The company said it will also move its marketing and other resources away from "high-cost, high-churn audiences in streaming." — Yun Li Stocks were relatively unchanged Tuesday morning. The S&P 500 rose about 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite rose almost 0.3%. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 88 points, or 0.2%. — Sean Conlon Shares of Alaska Air Group rose nearly 11% in premarket trading on the heels of the carrier raising its fourth-quarter earnings forecast and authorizing a $1 billion stock buyback. The company now expects earnings to come in between 40 cents and 50 cents per share, up from its prior guidance of 20 cents to 40 cents per share. Analysts polled by FactSet were looking for earnings of 49 cents per share for the period. Alaska Air also announced it is going to launch new nonstop flights to Japan and Korea in 2025 as part of its plan to deliver $1 billion in profit by 2027. The stock has outperformed the broader market this year, jumping more than 38% year to date. Shares have also gained around 36% over the past three months. — Sean Conlon, Leslie Josephs Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas appears to be cautiously optimistic about the outlook for the auto industry heading in 2025. "The US election result has extended the 'ICE is Nice' trade for a bit longer but keep on the lookout for hidden value in the EV ecosystem into the 2H. We recommend investors stay nimble and selective given the volatility of policy outcomes," Jonas said in a note to clients on Tuesday. "ICE" stands for internal combustion engine, the traditional alternative to electric vehicles. Morgan Stanley made two changes to its ratings of auto stocks: an upgrade of General Motors to equal weight from underweight, and hiking the price target on Tesla to $400 per share from $310. The new price target is just 2.5% above where Tesla closed on Monday, but the stock is still Jonas' top pick in the industry. Tesla could be a beneficiary from the new Trump administration if change leads to regulatory changes that usher along an autonomous driving future. "If the Trump Administration looks to clear the path for a Federal framework on autonomous vehicles, we believe investors will eventually appreciate that the discussion of AVs is also a discussion about EVs. Among a range of policy tools, we see tariffs as a lever to help accelerate onshoring of enabling technology underpinned by more de-risked supply chain," Jonas said. — Jesse Pound These are the stocks moving the most in premarket trading: Read the full list of stocks moving here. — Lisa Kailai Han Small businesses sentiment popped to its highest level in nearly three and a half years following November's presidential election, the National Federation of Independent Business reported Tuesday. The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index hit 101.7 for November, an increase of 8 points and the best reading since June 2021. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had forecast a reading of 94.8. "The election results signal a major shift in economic policy, leading to a surge in optimism among small business owners," said Bill Dunkelberg, the group's chief economist. "Owners are particularly hopeful for tax and regulation policies that favor strong economic growth as well as relief from inflationary pressures. In addition, small business owners are eager to expand their operations." Along with the higher reading for the headline index, the share of business owners expecting a better economy ahead jumped 41 points from October to a net 36%, the highest since June 2020. — Jeff Cox Fears surrounding aluminum packaging company Ball are overstated, according to Mizuho, which believes investors should buy the recent pullback in shares. The firm upgraded the stock to outperform from neutral and maintained its $67 price target, which is 16% above where shares closed on Monday. "Despite recent misplaced concerns about pricing and volume, we don't believe earnings are at risk, or that fundamentals have changed. We believe the recent pullback in the shares represents a good buying opportunity and an attractive entry point," analyst Edlain Rodriguez wrote in a Tuesday note. The company shut down around 15% of its manufacturing capacity to account for lower consumer demand post-pandemic. "That capacity closure has better positioned Ball for the medium-term as demand gradually normalizes," Rodriguez said. — Hakyung Kim Nvidia shares were down slightly a day after the chipmaker pulled back on China launching an investigation into the company possibly violating the country's antimonopoly law. The stock was last down 0.3% in the premarket. On Monday, it fell 2.6%, leading to Nvidia's longest losing streak since September. — Fred Imbert Citi believes Broadcom's fiscal fourth-quarter results will top expectations ahead of the company's earnings release on Thursday. Analyst Christopher Danely raised his price target on shares to $205 from $175, implying 14.6% upside potential from Monday's close. Danely also reiterated his buy rating on the stock. Danely estimates Broadcom could report up to $15 billion in sales, or a 7% rise from the previous quarter. The company's non-AI semiconductor business will likely drive its better-than-consensus results, he added. Current-quarter guidance could be held back on a slowdown in orders from Google, a leading AI customer, Danely said. "We do expect business to ramp from Meta throughout C25 and pick up the slack," Danely wrote in a Tuesday note. — Hakyung Kim South Korean markets led gains in Asia on Tuesday, with the country's blue-chip Kospi surging 2.43% and seeing its best day in almost three months, while the small-cap Kosdaq spiked 5.52%. That comes as the country continues to grapple with the fallout of President Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived martial law declaration. Other markets in Asia also climbed, with Japan's Nikkei 225 up 0.53% and mainland China's CSI 300 rising by 0.73%. — Lim Hui Jie European stocks opened lower on Tuesday, as investors reacted to Chinese import and export figures that came in below expectations in November. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index was 0.25% lower shortly after the opening bell, with all major bourses trading in negative territory.

S&P 500 futures ticked down 0.03%, while Nasdaq 100 futures lost 0.01%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered near the flatline. — Brian Evans Got a confidential news tip?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) just got a reality check from Bank of America. The firm downgraded the chipmaker from Buy to Neutral, slashed the price target from $180 to $155, and trimmed its 2025 earnings forecast by up to 8%. Why? Two words: fierce competition. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominates the AI accelerator market with an 80%+ share, while AMD scrambles to hold onto a meager 4%. Even Amazon, one of AMDs biggest cloud customers, is cozying up to NVIDIA and custom chipmakers like Marvell. Add a potential slowdown in PC demand next year, and AMDs near-term outlook looks dicey. But its not all doom and gloom. AMD has been making some serious power moves, like acquiring Silo AI and ZT Systems to solidify its AI strategy. In Q3, its Data Center segment revenue soared 122%, fueled by deals with heavyweights like Microsoft and Meta. AMDs low debt and $4.5 billion in cash give it a safety net, while its long-term plans to generate over $5 billion in GPU revenue in 2024 keep investors intrigued. And lets not forget: AMDs still the go-to for killer CPUs and GPUs, even if gaming and embedded segments had a rough quarter. The majority of Wall Street analysts are still screaming Strong Buy, with an average price target of $190thats a juicy 37% upside from here. But year-to-date, AMD is only up 3.3%, underperforming the tech-heavy NASDAQs (^IXIC) 34.5% rally. The takeaway? AMDs long-term AI potential is massive, but near-term risks are real. This is a stock for investors who like their opportunities bigand their risks bigger. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

Subscribe to receive notifications of new posts: 2024-12-09 Since the late 1990s, millions have relied on the Internet for searching, communicating, shopping, and working, though 2.6 billion people (about 31% of the global population) still lack Internet access. Over the years, use of the Internet has evolved from email and static sites to social media, streaming, e-commerce, cloud tools, and more recently AI chatbots, reflecting its constant adaptation to users' needs. This post explores how people interacted online in 2024, based on Cloudflareâs observations and a review of the yearâs DNS trends. Building on similar reports weâve done over the past several years, we have compiled a ranking of the top Internet properties of 2024, with the same categories included in 2023, including Generative AI. In addition to our overall ranking, we chose 9 categories to focus on: Generative AI Social Media Ecommerce Video Streaming News Messaging Metaverse & Gaming Financial Services Cryptocurrency Services As we have done since 2022, our analysis uses anonymized DNS query data from our 1.1.1.1 public DNS resolver, used by millions globally. We aggregate domains for each service (e.g., twitter.com, t.co, and x.com for X) and identify the sites that provide services to humans, thus excluding technical domains like root-servers.net. Rankings reflect relative popularity within categories, not absolute traffic. Therefore, a drop in rank doesnât always indicate less traffic to a specific Internet service â it may simply reflect increased competition from other services, leading to a change in rank. This part of the 2024 Cloudflare Radar Year in Review highlights shifts in Internet services, with rising platforms like Temu, GitHub Copilot, and WeChat reflecting changing user preferences. ChatGPT (OpenAI) also played a more prominent role in the generative AI space and in our Overall ranking, nearly reaching the Top 50. Major events like the Paris Olympics and US elections influenced rankings as well, boosting Olympics-related sites and news platforms like CNN and Fox News. This year, weâre also including a by-country/region perspective on the most popular Internet services for the first time, showing the Top 10 Overall for 132 countries/regions. At the bottom of this post, we highlight trends found in this localized data, including how ChatGPT performed best in Singapore. Keep reading for a detailed look at the evolution of trends throughout the year. For more, visit our 2024 Cloudflare Radar Year in Review microsite. Along with the lists of most popular Internet services, the Year in Review microsite and its associated blog post explore a number of additional metrics. Since 2021, weâve started our review of rankings with an Overall Top 10 list, showcasing the most popular Internet services globally based on DNS traffic from our 1.1.1.1 resolver. Unsurprisingly, Google (including services like Google Maps and Google Calendar) remained the #1 Internet service in 2024. Since introducing our ranking method two years ago, no other service has come close to challenging Googleâs top spot. Itâs important to note that Apple and Microsoft are similar to Google in that their main domains (apple.com or microsoft.com) are used for many different services. We include other services separately, such as Outlook or iCloud, which use their own specific domains. Google Facebook Apple TikTok Amazon Web Services Microsoft Instagram YouTube Amazon WhatsApp Beyond Google, Facebook consistently held the #2 spot throughout 2024. Last year, it competed with Apple for that position. Apple, which uses domains like apple.com for services related to its software and devices, was generally #3. However, TikTok challenged that position on several days since late August. Amazon Web Services (AWS), differentiated from Amazon by domains like amazonaws.com, performed better this year compared to 2023. It held the #5 spot but often traded places with Microsoft during the year. Instagram also rose in the rankings. It was around #8 in 2023 and steadily improved. Now, it holds the #7 spot, ahead of YouTube. Amazon remained at #9 for most of the year, the same as in 2023. WhatsApp, owned by Meta, appeared in the Top 10 for the first time, taking the #10 spot. Close to the Top 10 were Appleâs iCloud, Netflix (which performs better on weekends), and Microsoftâs Outlook. In the chart below, you can follow the evolution of the top Internet services in our Overall ranking throughout the year. In 2022, X (then known as Twitter) ranked as high as #10 in our overall ranking and was close to Instagram. It never reached the top 10 in 2023, and in 2024, X dropped further, to #14 or #15. More on Xâs performance in the Social Media category below. Generative AI gained global attention in late 2022 with the launch of ChatGPT, and became a global phenomenon during 2023. By 2024, ChatGPT (OpenAI) continues to be by far the most popular service in this category, which includes chatbots, coding bots, and more. Other generative AI services had more stable rankings compared to 2023. ChatGPT (OpenAI) Character.AI Codeium QuillBot Claude (Anthropic) Perplexity GitHub Copilot Wordtune Poe Tabnine Significant changes occurred below ChatGPTâs first place ranking throughout the year. Character.AI, an AI-driven chatbot platform, maintained a strong #2 position, staying ahead of Codeium, a code-generation AI tool that has improved its position since June, and Quillbot, an AI writing and paraphrasing tool. Claude, the AI chatbot from Anthropic, rose in the rankings, particularly after March 4, when the new model, Claude 3, was introduced, and again later in May when it became available in Europe. It reached #5 in June. Perplexity, an AI-driven search and Q&A platform, started the year outside the Top 10 but ended close to Claude. It surpassed Claude for the first time on November 6, 2024, the day after the U.S. elections, reaching #6. This next chart shows movement among the Generative AI services that were more popular later in the year. Several new players entered the Top 10 AI rankings in 2024, showing strong growth. GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant, experienced the fastest rise, entering the Top 10 in September (after reaching the Top 20 in June) and staying mostly between #5 and #3 by November, as the next chart shows. Similarly, Suno AI, an AI-powered audio and music generation platform, entered the Top 10 in April, briefly dropped out, but stabilized between #6 and #10 after October â in November, it ranked #6 on weekends. Some platforms lost ground in the rankings. Wordtune, an AI writing assistant, peaked at #4 during mid-year but declined afterward. Tabnine, another AI-powered coding assistant, held the #5 spot for months but slipped after July. In contrast, Sider AI, a coding assistant, entered the Top 20 in March and finished the year around #12. Poe, an AI chatbot platform, ranked #5 in 2023 and between #5 and #6 before June, but ended 2024 moving around #10, performing better during weekends. Google Gemini, Googleâs AI assistant and model, performed better on weekdays and started the year ranking between #7 and #10, but dropped out of the Top 10 after July as newer AI platforms gained momentum. Hugging Face, an open-source AI and machine learning platform, mostly fluctuated between #7 and #9 during the year, peaking at #4 on August 18 around the time several models were updated, and and as it reached its milestone of 5 million users. However, it fell out of the Top 10 by September. Midjourney, an AI-powered platform for generating images, performed well until June, when it was close to the Top 10. Additionally, the OpenAI API ranked #18 in the Generative AI category on May 14-15, coinciding with OpenAIâs announcement of GPT-4o availability, including in the API. Notable trends that we observed when looking at trends for Generative AI services within our larger Overall ranking include: ChatGPT continued its growth in 2024, similar to 2023. In early 2023, it ranked around #200 and ended the year near the top 100. In 2024, it started close to the top 100, reached the top 60 in May with the release of the 4o model, and has been near the top 50 since September, aligning with the return of workers and students to their routines. It ranks higher on weekdays, averaging #56, and drops on weekends. Comparing ChatGPT with other known and non-AI related websites, by late November, ChatGPT ranked ahead of Weather.com, Temu, eBay, Telegram, Google Calendar, and Prime Video, but trailed Disney Plus Character.ai also showed a clear growth trend in our Overall ranking, from outside the top 200 earlier in the year, to above #180 after July, performing better in August, reaching as high as #161. The AI-driven chatbot platform performed better on weekends than on weekdays, the opposite of ChatGPT. Codeium entered the top 300 in July. It ranked higher on weekdays than weekends. According to Kepios, there are an estimated 5.22 billion social media users worldwide in 2024 (up from 4.95 billion last year), representing 63.8% of the global population. Social media continues to play a major role in daily life, serving as a key platform for communication, information, and attention. Once again, social media giants like Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram dominate, ranking among the top 10 most popular Internet services overall. Facebook TikTok Instagram X Snapchat LinkedIn Discord Kwai Pinterest Reddit In the Social Media category rankings, the top seven remain unchanged from last year. However, there are notable developments in this category. In 2022, X briefly challenged Instagram for the #3 spot during a few days. Since 2023, X has held a solid #4 position, with Snapchat closing in and reaching #4 for the first time on several days in September and October. LinkedIn stayed steady at #6, followed by Discord. Kwai, a Chinese video app popular in Brazil (with 60 million reported users) and other countries (a reported ), rose from #10 last year to #8. Further down the list, Pinterest kept its #9 rank, while Reddit, previously #8 in 2023, dropped to #10 this year, but peaked at #7 on November 26, just before Black Friday and Thanksgiving in the US. Hereâs the Social Media Top 10 chart for 2024: Our global ranking also highlights several non-Western platforms in the Top 20. These include Douyin (#11), the Chinese version of TikTok; VK (#12), often referred to as the Russian Facebook; and TikTok rivals popular in Southeast Asia SnackVideo (#13) by Chinese Kuaishou (that also owns Kwai). OnlyFans appeared consistently in the Top 20 starting in September, ranking around #18 and surpassing Tumblr by late November. The #18 spot was briefly held by X alternative Threads (by Instagram) in late September and by Bluesky starting November 18. Mastodon-related servers reached as high as #19 for several days since late August. Hereâs a look at X (on top) and its alternatives in this category: Letâs move beyond the Social Media category to see how these platforms performed in our Overall ranking, where bigger shifts between services are evident. As weâve seen, Threads, Bluesky, and Mastodon (via an aggregation of popular servers) didnât break into the Top 10 of the Social Media category. However, in the Overall ranking, Mastodon servers, bundled together, consistently ranked between #208 and #248, performing better on weekends. Bluesky entered the Top 250 in September 2024, and gained additional attention after the US elections. It rose sharply after November 14, peaking at #193 on November 20, and has since stabilized around #220.Â Threads entered the Top 250 in August 2024, peaking at #183 on September 24 before dropping out in October. In 2023, Threads peaked at #227 in early July but fell out of the Top 250 by late August. Itâs worth noting that Threads also uses Instagramâs cdninstagram.com for images and videos, which may influence Threads position in our DNS rankings (that said, Instagram wasnât impacted by Threads appearance in our rankings). Here are some other trends we observed among social media apps, and how they did in our Overall ranking: Instagramâs best day (#6 in the Overall ranking) was August 5, 2024, coinciding with the week the app was banned in Turkey. Xâs best day of the year in our ranking was April 14, when it reached #12. This coincided with Arsenal losing the top position in the English football/soccer Premier League (the most-watched sports league in the world) to Manchester City, which went on to win its fourth title in a row. Last year, we noted how football/soccer in England impacted Xâs ranking. X also reached #13 on August 9 and 10, during the final weekend of the Paris 2024 Olympics. X performed better on weekdays, while LinkedIn ranked higher between Mondays and Wednesdays. Snapchat and Discord performed better on weekends. Reddit consistently stayed in our Top 50 in 2024, showing growth from around #45 to #40 by November, with a peak at #38 on November 26. It performed better between Mondays and Wednesdays. Quora displayed a downward trend in our ranking, dropping from around #140 to #160. It performed better between Mondays and Wednesdays.Â Tinder, which performs better on Sundays, started the year around #150 but eventually dropped below #160. Tumblr followed a similar pattern, dropping out of the Top 200, where it was in early 2024, to outside the ranking entirely since September. Tumblr performed better on weekends. OnlyFans showed growth in our Overall ranking, sitting around the Top 220 with a peak at #213 on December 1. It performed better on weekends. The importance of e-commerce continues to grow, as highlighted in our recent Cyber Week 2024 blog post. Amazon leads the category, followed by Taobao, the Chinese marketplace, holding a steady #2 spot as it also did in 2023. New to #3 is AliExpress, the global online retail giant from China. Amazon Taobao AliExpress Shopify Temu Alibaba eBay Shein Mercado Libre Wildberries (RU) Compared to 2023, eBay lost its #3 spot globally and dropped down to #7, despite starting 2024 at #3 for several days. AliExpress claimed #3, followed by Shopify (#4), the Canadian platform hosting numerous online stores, and Temu (#5). Temu, the low-cost, fast-fashion marketplace launched in the US in September 2022, ended 2023 at #7 but rose to #5 in 2024, occasionally reaching #4 since August. Alibaba dropped to #6 in September. Shein, the Chinese fast-fashion brand, continued its growth and overtook Mercado Libre (#8) in November. A surprise this year was Wildberries, often called Russiaâs âAmazon,âÂ that has been expanding to several neighboring countries (including some in Europe). It climbed to #10 in September, surpassing OLX (which held #10 for several months), Rakuten, and Lazada. Looking at how e-commerce sites performed in our Overall ranking, we observed the following trends: Amazon fluctuated between #9 and #10 after October, returning to #9 on November 30 and December 1, during the Black Friday weekend. It often performed better on weekends. Shopifyâs best day of the year was Black Friday, November 29, when it reached #55. The global e-commerce platform performed better during weekdays. Temu, known for low-cost products, started 2024 outside the Top 100 but climbed into the Top 70 by year-end. It performed best in late October and early November, peaking at #63, with a Black Friday spike to #65. Shein, the Chinese fast-fashion brand, showed growth, nearing the Top 100 in early 2024 before dropping to the Top 140 between June and October. It rebounded in November, peaking at #83 on Black Friday. A similar trend was observed in 2023, when it ended the year around the Top 120. Hereâs the comparison between recent players Temu and Shein: eBay consistently ranked between #72 and #80, peaking at #62 on October 5-6 and again in late November, just before Black Friday. It often performed better on weekends. Mercado Libre, the Latin American marketplace, had its best day on Black Friday, November 29, reaching #100. Adidas entered the Top 250, ranking #232 on Black Friday, November 29. Target performed well in November, peaking at #133 on November 27, the day before Thanksgiving in the US, and at #127 on December 1. It often performed better on Sundays. Walmart improved its performance from September onward, with its best days on November 25-26, reaching #150. Ikea, the Swedish furniture retailer, peaked at #247 on June 29. The relevance of video streaming platforms shows no signs of fading. In 2024, the Top 3 rankings stayed unchanged from 2023, with YouTube firmly holding the #1 spot, followed by Netflix. Among paid streaming services, Netflix leads, trailed by Disney Plus and Amazon Prime Video. Other paid streaming services are outside the Top 10, including, in ranked order: HBO/Max, Hulu, Peacock, and Paramount Plus. YouTube Netflix Twitch Roku Disney Plus Amazon Prime Video Vimeo Plex.TV Pluto TV Â Bigo Live Twitch, a live-streaming platform for gaming, kept the #3 spot, as it did in 2023 and 2022. Roku, a digital media player that also offers streaming services, ranked #4, maintaining its position from last year. Similarly, Disney Plus (#5) and Amazon Prime Video (#6) held their spots, while Hulu dropped out of the Top 10. The creative video platform Vimeo showed clear popularity growth since May, followed by recent players like Plex TV, a media platform with streaming that performed better starting in October, and Pluto TV, a free ad-supported streaming service that also showed growth throughout the year. Bigo Live, a live-streaming social platform, entered the Top 10 rankings in May.Â Next, the Top 10 overtime perspective: Throughout the year, Disney Plus occasionally challenged Roku, especially on weekends, a trend similar to what was observed in 2023. Looking at how video streaming services performed in our Overall ranking, we found: Netflix consistently ranked #12 on most weekends, particularly Sundays, through late May and resumed the same trend after August. Netflix, Disney Plus, Prime Video, and HBO/Max were more popular on weekends, especially Sundays. Disney Plus ranged between #50 and #60, with a strong start to the year and a spike to #51 on September 22, coinciding with the premiere of the new Marvel show Agatha All Along. Prime Video had its best day in the rankings on May 25, at #56, the day the movie Bombshell with Nicole Kidman premiered on the platform. HBO/Max was consistently around the Top 100 until August. but dropped out after October. Peacock had an inconsistent presence in the Top 250 but reappeared in late July during the Paris 2024 Olympics, reaching #176 on July 28. That was one of the busiest days for Olympic events, as detailed in our blog post on the event. Paramount Plus was mostly outside the Top 250 this year but peaked at #216 on February 11, the day of the Super Bowl, which the platform streamed. News organizations are vital for keeping the public informed, especially during crises. With that in mind, this ranking of news services, some of which are well-established news outlets while others are news aggregators, also highlights a few newsworthy trends. Globo BBC NY Times CNN Fox News Google News Yahoo Finance Daily Mail RT NewsBreak This yearâs rankings in the news category mirrored 2023 at the top. Globo, the Brazilian media giant â one of the largest in Latin America and globally â encompassing radio, TV, newspapers, and magazines, stayed #1, followed by the British BBC at #2, that operates globally and in 42 languages.Â The New York Times rose to #3 this year (it was #5 in 2023), overtaking CNN (#4) and Fox News (#5), which dropped from its position at #3 in 2023 and this year came behind CNN. Several prominent outlets, such as the Washington Post, The Guardian, NPR, and the Wall Street Journal, fell out of the Top 10 this year. These outlets had higher rankings in late 2023 following the start of the Hamas-Israel conflict on October 7. News aggregators gained prominence, with Google News (#6) and also Yahoo Finance (#7), focused on financial news (and that came in front of Yahoo News), and NewsBreak (#10), a US-based local news app, entering the Top 10.Â The British Daily Mail, which has also expanded its focus to the US and Australia, ranked #8, followed by RT, the Russian news TV network with a global presence. RT launched its Brazil/Portuguese version in late 2023 and was recently highlighted in a report and an alert from the US Department of State regarding its global operations. The US elections impacted rankings. CNN climbed to #2 on November 5, election day, and reached #1 on November 6, while Fox News peaked at #3. NBC News also improved, reaching #11 on November 5 and #7 the following day. Associated Press ranked #8 on November 5 as well. Hereâs the News ranking: Notable news trends we identified in our larger Overall ranking include: As weâve seen in the News category, the US elections on November 5, 2024, caused CNN, Fox News, and others to jump in our rankings. This trend was also evident in the Overall ranking for the following media outlets, listed by performance. November 6 was the best day of 2024 for each: CNN: #105 on November 5; #72 on November 6 Fox News: #153 on November 5; #92 on November 6 BBC: #115 on November 5, and #97 on November 6 NY Times: #149 on November 5; #98 on November 6 NBC News: #160 on November 6 Associated Press: #166 on November 6 Google News: #250 on November 5; #228 on November 6 Wall Street Journal: #241 on November 6 Washington Post: #245 on November 6 In the next chart we show rankings for CNN, Fox News, the BBC, and NY Times: Brazil made headlines in late February when thousands of Bolsonaro supporters protested to defend the former president against investigations. During this period, Globo moved up the rankings, reaching #60 on February 24-25, 2024. WP, the news aggregator from Poland, had its best day on July 26 (#188), coinciding with Polish lawmakers voting to allow security forces to use lethal weapons with âimpunityâ, particularly at the tense border with Belarus. WP peaked again on November 6 (#180), the day after the US elections, when the result of the election was mentioned in Polandâs parliament. Its third and final peak was on Black Friday, November 29, again at #180. Rambler, the Russian news aggregator, peaked at #218 on February 23, 2024, the day after the Moscow concert hall attack and the same day Vladimir Putin addressed the nation. Messaging remains relevant, especially for specific communication purposes. Appleâs iMessage is excluded from this category because it lacks a unique domain name for traffic analysis. With that in mind, WhatsApp retained its position as the top messaging service in 2024, consistent with 2023 and 2022. WhatsApp QQ Telegram Viber WeChat Signal LINE KakaoTalk eitaa.com Facebook Messenger Following WhatsApp at #2 is, for the second year in a row, the Chinese service QQ, also known as Tencent QQ, which includes games and mobile payments and is popular in Asia. Telegram, widely used in Eastern Europe and Asia, took the #3 spot from Viber in June. Viber remains popular in Eastern Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. WeChat rose this year, securing #5 in October and surpassing Signal, which held that position for most of the year but dropped to #6 (the same position in which it ended 2023). LINE from Japan ranked #7, while new entries to the Top 10 included South Koreaâs KakaoTalk (#8) and Iranâs eitaa.com (#9), a messaging application, designed for both mobile and desktop platforms, that is popular in Iran and among the Farsi (Persian) language diaspora. Facebook Messenger rounded out the Top 10 at #10. Here are other messaging trends from our Overall ranking: WhatsApp, as noted, performed better this year, growing in popularity since late July, stabilizing at #9 by mid-October, and performing better during weekdays. Telegramâs best days were between July 16-18, during developments in the Ukraine war, including the Russian Black Sea Fleet leaving Crimea. Telegram is widely used by thousands of Russian âwar correspondents,â as recently reported. Eitaa, the Iranian cloud-based messaging app, peaked at #185 in our Overall ranking on April 14, 2024, the day of Iranian strikes against Israel, which we covered in a blog post on Internet trends. WeChat spiked in our Overall ranking (#116) on July 30, 2024, coinciding with Chinese leaders pledging to tilt stimulus efforts towards consumers. Gaming and metaverse both involve immersing players in other worlds. Leaving concepts aside, weâve grouped gaming and the metaverse into the same category since 2022. Roblox dominated this category again in 2024, retaining its top spot, followed by Microsoftâs Xbox at #2. Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, ranked third. Roblox Xbox/Xbox Live Epic Games/Fortnite Steam PlayStation Electronic Arts Blizzard Riot Games/League of Legends Minecraft Garena Xbox/Xbox Live held #2 consistently, but Epic Games/Fortnite contested the position earlier in the year and again in November. Steam was a surprise this year, jumping to #4, ahead of PlayStation. It even rose to #2 in late March and early April, coinciding with the launch of a new demo. Other platforms on the rise included Electronic Arts, Blizzard, and Riot Games/League of Legends. Minecraft made the Top 10 at #9, performing best on July 5, 6, and 10, when it reached #7. Garena, the Singaporean game developer and publisher, entered the Top 10 for the first time. Oculus, Metaâs VR headset and metaverse service, dropped out of the Top 10 to #11, after ending 2023 at #5. It performed better earlier in the year (until April) and in late November. Hereâs the top chart across 2024: Here are other metaverse and gaming trends from our Overall ranking: Robloxâs best day in 2024 was January 21, when it reached #20. The platform performed better on weekends, especially Sundays, similar to other popular gaming platforms like Xbox/Xbox Live, Epic Games/Fortnite, Steam, and PlayStation. Epic Games/Fortniteâs best day was January 1, 2024. Xbox/Xbox Live (#37) and PlayStation (#43) had their best day on November 2, 2024, the day before the launch of the new version of the classic game Aero the Acro-Bat: Rascal Rival Revenge. Steamâs best day was August 24, 2024, during the week of Gamescom 2024 in Germany. Several new games were released that week, including Tactical Breach Wizards and Dustborn. Minecraft, celebrating its 15th anniversary in May 2024, had its best days on June 15 (#90), following the release of the Tricky Trials game update by Mojang Studios, and August 17 (#90), coinciding with the release of Minecraft: Java Edition Snapshot 24w33a. Financial services cover everything from traditional banking to cryptocurrencies and tax tools. Stripe, the Irish-American payment platform, kept its #1 spot for the second year, after overtaking PayPal in this category in 2023. Stripe TradingView Alipay PayPal Nubank (BR) Binance Coinbase Banco do Brasil Bradesco Bank Itau PayPal spent only a few days at #2 and a few others at #3 this year, but ultimately dropped to #4. TradingView, a platform specializing in tools for traders and investors, climbed to #2, followed by AliPay, the Chinese mobile and online payment platform, which secured #3. Nubank, the Brazilian neobank (only online) and considered to be the most valuable, one of the biggest Latin America financial groups and the world's biggest digital bank, entered the Top 10 at #5, while Binance rose to #6 (up from #8 last year). Binance also peaked at #3 on November 12-13, following the US elections, as Bitcoin reached new highs. In the crypto space, Coinbase joined the Top 10 for the first time. Brazilâs growth in online banking, digital banks, and payments in Latin America has driven traditional banks to expand their digital presence. In 2024, Banco do Brasil, Bradesco, and ItaÃº performed well and rose into the Top 10, moving more than ever to the online space including in partnership with each other (as detailed in these two (1), (2) articles in Portuguese). And hereâs the crypto perspective in this Financial services category: Next, we highlight other financial services trends from our Overall ranking: Stripeâs best days were just before Black Friday, on November 18-19 and November 25, reaching #81 during those days. Stripe performed better on weekends and maintained consistent rankings throughout the year. PayPal ranked higher around Black Friday week, peaking at #89 on November 21 and on Black Friday, November 29. Brazilian bank Nubank performed best a few days before Carnival in Brazil (February 10-14), reaching #87 on February 1 and 3 and #92 on February 10. It also ranked well on Black Friday, November 29, peaking at #90. In addition to our Financial Services category, we evaluated cryptocurrency-related services specifically. Despite a few crashes over recent years, the crypto sector continued to evolve in 2024, experiencing a late-year boom, as we explore below. Binance and Coinbase retained the top two spots, while OKX climbed to #3 this year. Binance Coinbase OKX 2miners.com CoinMarketCap Coingecko Bybit Exodus Tonkeeper NiceHash CoinGecko, a cryptocurrency data platform, dropped to #6, making way for OKX in late August, while new entrant 2miners.com rose to #4. CoinMarketCap ranked #5, followed by several dynamic new entrants in the Top 10: Bybit (#7): A cryptocurrency exchange offering spot and derivatives trading. Exodus (#8): A user-friendly, multi-asset cryptocurrency wallet. Tonkeeper (#9): A secure wallet for managing Toncoin and related assets. NiceHash, a platform connecting cryptocurrency miners and buyers, performed better in 2023, but dropped from #5 to #10 this year. The US elections also had an apparent effect on the Overall ranking: Binance entered the Top 100 for the first time on September 26, when Bitcoin surged past $65,000, driven by positive US employment data and Chinaâs announcement of economic stimulus measures. It peaked at #97 on November 13, following the US elections and Donald Trumpâs victory, as Bitcoin's price surpassed $90,000 for the first time. Coinbaseâs best day was November 21, reaching #131, as Bitcoin approached $100,000 (which it surpassed on December 4, although our ranking only covers up to December 1). OKX peaked at #149 on November 22, and CoinMarketCap reached #176 on November 23. CoinGeckoâs best day was November 11, the week following the US elections, when it climbed to #137. Outside the categories we reviewed as part of the Year in Review, several notable trends emerged in our Overall ranking: The Paris 2024 Summer Olympics (July 26âAugust 11, 2024) appeared in our Top 250 Overall ranking, with Olympics-related sites debuting on July 27 (#195), the first full day of events. The peak was on July 30 (#177), driven by LÃ©on Marchandâs swimming performances and the US womenâs artistic gymnastics medal, as detailed in our Olympics blog post. The final day in the Top 250 was August 11 (#217). Spotify ranked between #17 and #18 this year, performing best in October, spending most of the month at #17. However, as our list ends on December 1, we are not tracking the impact of the recently launched Spotify Wrapped. Tesla entered the Top 250 after October. Its best day was October 12 (#245), following the Cybercab robotaxi reveal. It also ranked higher on November 17 (#246), after a post-US elections stock rally. GitHubâs best day was November 8 (#31), coinciding with its announcement of enhanced security protocols, including mandatory two-factor authentication (2FA) for organizations. NBA appeared in the Top 250 until early March, with its best day on February 4, during these games. Nike ranked only once, on March 26 (#236), during the annual Air Max Day celebration. Brazilâs official Judiciary site peaked at #105 on October 6, during the first round of municipal elections. Ticketmaster peaked at #169 on October 8, during a major service disruption, followed by October 9 (#170), the day Australian F1 tickets went on sale. Intuitâs best day was April 15 (#121), US Tax Day, consistent with previous years. Weather.com peaked at #61 between August 4â6, during Hurricane Debbyâs landfall in Florida. The best day for IMDb (the Internet Movie Database) was January 1 (#220). Example.com, a domain used for documentation purposes, ranked between #24 and #56. Regarding our newly country/region-specific Popular Internet Services overall lists (available on the Year in Review microsite), we observed that Google ranked #1 in nearly all countries. However, there are other notable highlights we feel are worth sharing: TikTok was ranked #1 in Iraq, Kosovo, and Libya, and #2 in over 30 countries/regions across different continents. Examples include Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Belarus, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Palestine, Ukraine, Venezuela, and South Africa. Facebook was #1 in Myanmar and #2 in 69 other countries. Myanmar, where the government is known to block several websites, fell to the bottom of Freedom Houseâs Internet freedom ranking this year. Instagram performed well in several countries, ranking among the top five in 18 countries/regions. X showed strong performance in Japan, where it is widely known, ranking #3 in 2024. It also ranked within the top 10 in 23 countries/regions. Reddit did not make the Top 10 in any country but performed best in Iceland (#26) and the United States (#28). Kwai, the social media platform, performed best in Brazil, ranking #7 overall. Snapchat performed well in Iraq and Kosovo (#4) and in Libya, Palestine, and Saudi Arabia (#5). ChatGPT did not reach the Top 10 in any country but made it into the Top 50 in 47 countries. It performed best in Singapore (#35), Kyrgyzstan, Sri Lanka (#36), Switzerland, Taiwan (#37), Ethiopia (#38), Japan, Iceland, and Haiti (#40). YouTube ranked in the Top 10 in 113 countries/regions, and reached the Top 5 in countries like Bangladesh (#4), and Armenia, Georgia, Guyana, Kenya, Peru, Qatar, Ukraine, and Uganda (#5). Netflix made the Top 10 in 17 countries/regions, performing best in Colombia and Ecuador (#8) and in Bolivia, Chile, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Trinidad and Tobago (#9). WhatsApp made the Top 10 in 90 countries/regions and ranked in the Top 5 in over 35, reaching #4 in regions such as Latin America, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East, including Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Guyana, Indonesia, Laos, Peru, Pakistan, Paraguay, Uganda, and Venezuela. LINE, the messaging app by Naver, made the Top 10 in Thailand (#8). Viber, the messaging service, ranked in the Top 10 in Myanmar (#5), Ukraine (#9), and Bosnia and Herzegovina (#10). Zalo.me, the Vietnamese multi-platform messaging app, ranked #6 in Vietnam. Yandex, the Russian search engine and portal, ranked highest in Belarus and Russia (#3), as well as in Kazakhstan, Latvia, and Uzbekistan (#5). Yahoo appeared only in Japanâs Top 10. Temu, which showed notable growth in 2024, did not feature in the Top 10 in any country/region, but placed in the Top 30 in Oman (#18), Bahrain (#25), Kuwait (#26), the Dominican Republic, and Qatar (#27). Roblox appeared in the Top 10 in only three countries/regions: Philippines (#7), Kosovo (#8), and Trinidad and Tobago (#10). Wikipedia reached the #10 spot in Bangladesh and Ukraine. Microsoft Office 365 performed best in Europe, ranking #4 in Slovenia, #5 in Portugal, and #6 in Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, as well as in Australia and New Zealand. Microsoft Outlook showed strong performance in Australia (#7), Denmark, New Zealand, and Slovenia (#8). Naver, the South Korean platform and search engine, ranked #4 in South Korea. The Internet continues to shape how we socialize, work, and stay informed. Our 2024 rankings highlight the enduring dominance of platforms like Google, Facebook, and TikTok, alongside the rapid rise of generative AI services like OpenAIâs ChatGPT, with new players like GitHub Copilot and Claude making strides. In social media, X shows declining influence, while Threads, Bluesky, and Mastodon are carving out niches but remain far from overtaking established platforms. Temu continues to rise in e-commerce, while Shein and AliExpress strengthened their global positions. In cryptocurrency, Binance regained momentum as Bitcoin surged, and newer players entered the scene. Gaming saw Roblox maintain its lead, with Steam experiencing notable growth. Events like the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics, US elections, and war-related attacks also shaped Internet trends, emphasizing how global events influence online activity. These trends mirror real-world developments and set the stage for an interconnected, tech-driven future. On a final note, creating rankings is a team effort that comes with its own challenges and requires careful attention and frequent updates. We welcome your feedback and suggestions for new categories to explore in the Year in Review. (Our data scientist, Sabina Zejnilovic, played a crucial role in gathering the Internet services data.)

Title: Dow Jones, Nasdaq, S&P 500 weekly preview:
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/dow-jones-nasdaq-sp-500-weekly-preview-3761136
Time Published: 2024-12-09T12:25:12Z
Full Content:
Investing.com -- The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite reached new record highs on Friday, supported by slightly stronger-than-expected November jobs data that likely won’t deter the Federal Reserve from cutting rates later this month. The S&P 500 gained 0.25% to finish at 6,090.27, while the Nasdaq advanced 0.81% to 19,859.77, driven by strong performances from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Both indexes hit all-time highs during the session and closed at new peaks. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 123.19 points, or 0.28%, ending the day at 44,642.52. For the week, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their third consecutive weekly gains, rising 0.96% and 3.34%, respectively. The Dow, however, edged down 0.6% over the same period. Friday’s jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls increasing by 227,000 in November, surpassing the Dow Jones forecast of 214,000 and reflecting a sharp rebound from October’s upwardly revised gain of 36,000. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%, in line with expectations. Much of the focus this week will be on incoming inflation data, with the November Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) set to be released on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. JPMorgan strategists anticipate the CPI to show a 0.3% increase in the core index. They note that it would take a significant surprise in the data to alter their expectations for the Federal Reserve’s policy trajectory. "With the blackout period beginning this weekend, we doubt Fed officials will want to go into the December meeting with the same amount of drama as preceded the September meeting," strategists led by Michael Feroli said in a note. On the producer price front, the strategists estimate a 0.2% rise in the final demand producer price index (PPI) for November, consistent with October’s pace. Energy prices are expected to edge up by 0.3% following three consecutive months of declines, while food prices are projected to firm slightly with a 0.2% increase, reversing October’s 0.2% dip. Excluding food and energy, they forecast core PPI to rise by 0.2%, aligning with its trend in recent months. However, they foresee a modest slowdown in core goods PPI growth, projecting a 0.1% increase for November compared to the stronger 0.3% gain in October. Separately, Citi strategists said a softer core CPI this week “should also shift Fed and market attention away from sticky inflation and towards softening jobs.” The Wall Street firm expects a 25 basis point (bp) cut from the Fed at its meeting next week, and for cuts to continue at upcoming meetings to a terminal rate of 3.00-3.25%. This week also brings several important updates on the earnings front. Investors and analysts will get a chance to dive into new financial results from Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), Toll Brothers (NYSE:TOL), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), among others. Broadcom, a key AI player, has delivered impressive performance this year, with a 60% stock gain year-to-date. The outperformance has been driven by strong growth fueled by its AI compute and networking businesses. Moreover, VMware (NYSE:VMW), acquired by Broadcom over a year ago, appears on track to achieve its $4 billion quarterly revenue run rate and $12 billion annual target. Oppenheimer: “We are initiating our price target for the S&P 500 for 2025 at 7100 by year-end. This is 16.7% above last Friday’s close and implies a 25.8x multiple over our earnings forecast of $275.” “In the equity markets companies in all eleven sectors could benefit from improved productivity via AI to further serve the needs of business and customers.” Citi: “We maintain a positive view on US equities headed into 2025. A base case 6500 S&P 500 target allows for mid-single digit gains on the heels of back- to-back 20%+ years. Ongoing soft landing and Artificial Intelligence tailwinds now interact with Trump policy promises, and risks. Continued broadening beyond Mega Cap Growth impacts is critical but an extended valuation starting point will be an ongoing hurdle. Our bull and bear case assumptions help frame an expectation for increased volatility next year.” BCA Research: “The labor market is in the midst of an unusual limbo in which job creation (hiring) and destruction (layoffs) are both muted. We expect that continued softening will eventually provoke a wave of layoffs, triggering a vicious circle in which shrinking payrolls beget slower spending, begetting further payroll contraction and still slower spending growth until businesses slash discretionary investment and a recession ensues. While we expect the recession will be mild and brief, we nonetheless expect the S&P 500 will suffer a bear market.” UBS: “With risks either not materializing or investors not paying much attention to them as the holidays approach, the path of least resistance is for the markets to keep rallying. In-line inflation data this week and the Fed cutting 25bps next week don’t guarantee this as these outcomes should be largely priced in. But absent negative news flow, upward momentum tends to be self-reinforcing, supported by investors chasing the rally. The trade-off is that it sets up the markets for a correction in 1Q should the data or policy fall short of expectations." Evercore ISI: “While S&P 500 TTM P/E at 25x is lofty, exuberance has not become irrational, nor have asset prices gone “too far” as to put the end of the Bull Market in sight. Valuations are not extreme “enough” with the Fed cutting and the Economy still strong, unlike the Dot.Com and Housing bubbles. The sentiment is optimistic but not yet universally so. And the market cap of speculation hotspots Crypto + TSLA at less than $5T are not meaningful enough in proportion to cause a broad dislocation on a pullback.”

December 09, 2024 06:30 ET | Source: Radisson Mining Resources Inc. Radisson Mining Resources Inc. ROUYN-NORANDA, Quebec, Dec. 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Radisson Mining Resources Inc. (TSX-V: RDS, OTCQB: RMRDF) (“Radisson” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce results from a single and remarkably high-grade diamond drill hole recently completed at its 100%-owned O’Brien Gold Project (“O’Brien” or the “Project”) located in the Abitibi region of Québec. OB-24-347 was a shallow hole drilled at the eastern margin of the historic O’Brien Gold Mine workings. At approximately 200 metres vertical depth it intersected 643.1 grams per tonne (“g/t”) gold (“Au”) over 2.1 metres, including 1,345.0 g/t Au over 1.0 metre. The extensive nuggety-gold and high silicification suggest that the hole has intersected the near-surface extension of the famous O’Brien “Jewellery Box”, a mining stope believed to be the source of extremely high-grade and museum quality gold samples. Video of the core is available HERE. Matt Manson, President & CEO, commented: “When the O’Brien Gold Mine was operational between 1926 and 1957, it was known for very high grades and spectacular specimens of visible gold, many of which are now in the collection of the Royal Ontario Museum. The source of some of the best specimens was thought to be the Jewellery Box stope, a narrow, vertical grade-shoot extending from 250 metres depth to at least 750 metres depth. At the time, exploration drifts were developed to try to find this zone above the 250 metres level, without success. Now, drill-hole OB-24-347 has intersected what we believe is the same Jewellery Box zone marginally offset to the east. We intend to now trace it to the surface with additional drilling and expose it with stripping. This is being planned for our 2025 exploration program. Steeply plunging high-grade shoots are characteristic of the O’Brien Gold Project. The Jewellery Box Stope was always the best of these. Its potential re-discovery offers very high value, low-hanging fruit for a future O’Brien mine.” Figure 1: Visible Gold in Drill Hole OB-24-347Matt Manson continued: “Our 2024 drill program of 35,000 metres has comprised a combination of shallower holes, such as with today’s news, and deeper holes exploring the full depth potential of O’Brien gold mineralization. Of note, we have recently completed drill hole OB-24-337, the first hole ever drilled directly below the historic mine and, at 1,700 metres, the deepest hole ever drilled at the Project. The results from this hole are expected to be released shortly.” Figure 2: Long Section and Plan View of Gold Vein Mineralization and Mineral Resources at the O’Brien Gold Project, with the Location of OB-24-347 Illustrated. Gold Mineralization at O’Brien Gold mineralizing quartz-sulphide veins at O’Brien occur within a thin band of interlayered mafic volcanic rocks, conglomerates, and porphyric andesitic sills of the Piché Group occurring in contact with the east-west oriented Larder Lake-Cadillac Break (“LLCB”). Gold, along with pyrite and arsenopyrite, is typically associated with shearing and a pervasive biotite alteration, and developed within multiple Piché Group lithologies and, occasionally, the hanging-wall Pontiac and footwall Cadillac meta-sedimentary rocks. As mapped at the historic O’Brien mine, and now replicated in the modern drilling, individual veins are generally narrow, ranging from several centimetres up to several metres in thickness. Multiple veins occur sub-parallel to each other, as well as sub-parallel to the Piché lithologies and the LLCB. Individual veins have well-established lateral continuity, with near-vertical, high-grade shoots developed over significant lengths. The historic O’Brien mine produced over half a million ounces of gold from such veins and shoots at an average grade exceeding 15 g/t and over a vertical extent of at least 1,000 metres. Based on the modern drilling, the Project has estimated Indicated Mineral Resources of 0.50 million ounces (1.52 million tonnes at 10.26 g/t Au), with additional Inferred Mineral Resources of 0.45 million ounces (1.60 million tonnes at 8.66 g/t Au). Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Current exploration is focussed on delineating well developed vein mineralization to the east of the historic mine, with additional high-grade shoots becoming evident in the exploration data over what has been described as a series of repeating trends (“Trend #s 0 to 5”). Figure 3: More Visible Gold in Drill Hole OB 24-347. Table 1: Detailed Assay Results from Drill Hole OB-24-347 Notes on Calculation of Drill InterceptsThe O’Brien Gold Project March 2023 Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”) utilizes a 4.50 g/t Au bottom cutoff, a US$1600 gold price, a minimum mining width of 1.2 metres, and a 40 g/t Au upper cap on composites. Intercepts presented in Table 1 are calculated with a 1.00 g/t bottom cut-off over a minimum 1.0 metre core length so as to illustrate the frequency and continuity of mineralized intervals within which high-grade gold veins at O’Brien are developed. This methodology differs from previous Radisson disclosure, and intercepts reported in this release may not be directly comparable to historical published intercepts. Sample grades are uncapped. True widths, based on depth of intercept and drill hole inclination, are estimated to be 30-70% of core length.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index jumped nearly 3% in its final hour of trade, after china vowed "more proactive" fiscal measures and "moderately" looser monetary policy next year to boost domestic consumption. The announcement came from an official readout of a key policy meeting that outlined upcoming economic priorities. Prior to the news, mainland China's CSI 300 index fell 0.17% to close at 3,966.57 after China's consumer price growth came in below expectations in November. CPI rose 0.2% year on year, down from a 0.3% increase in October, according to the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday. Economists from Reuters forecast price growth of 0.5%. Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific, markets were mixed as traders assessed revised economic growth data from Japan and South Korea's political situation. South Korea's Kospi stock index fell after President Yoon Suk Yeol survived an impeachment vote over the weekend as the fallout from his brief declaration of martial law continues to roil the country. The benchmark index fell 2.78% to 2,360.58, while the small-cap Kosdaq dropped 5.19% to 627.01 as investors continued to monitor the country's political situation. While Yoon's People Power Party boycotted the Saturday impeachment vote brought by opposition parties, its leader has said that Yoon would step down. Meanwhile, prosecutors in the country have named President Yoon as a subject in a criminal investigation for potential charges of treason and abuse of power, according to local media reports. Japan's Nikkei 225 climbed 0.18% to end the trading day at 39,160.5, while the Topix gained 0.27% to 2,734.56. The country's third-quarter gross domestic product was revised to 0.3% on a quarter-on-quarter basis, up from 0.2% and above estimates from a Reuters poll that predicted no change. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 ended marginally higher at 8,423. In the U.S. on Friday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose to fresh records after November jobs data came in slightly better than expected, but not so hot as to deter the Federal Reserve from cutting rates again later this month. The broad market S&P 500 climbed 0.25% to 6,090.27. Tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced 0.81% to 19,859.77, bolstered by gains in Tesla, Meta Platforms and Amazon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 123.19 points, or 0.28%, to close at 44,642.52. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq went on to their third straight positive week as well, rising 0.96% and 3.34%, respectively. The Dow slipped 0.6% during the period. — CNBC's Sean Conlon, Lisa Kailai Han and Pia Singh contributed to this report. China's leaders on Monday pledged "more proactive" fiscal measures and "moderately" looser monetary policy next year to boost domestic consumption, according to an official readout of a key policy meeting that outlined upcoming economic priorities. The Politburo, a top decision-making body led by President Xi Jinping, said it will stabilize property and stock markets while strengthening the "unconventional counter-cyclical" adjustment, the Communist Party's CNBC-translated readout said. Read the full story here. — Anniek Bao Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University, says China needs more targeted and substantial fiscal stimulus measures, accompanied by confidence-building measures from the government. Speaking to CNBC's "Street Signs Asia," the economist said China's weak consumer inflation data released on Monday was "not surprising, but certainly disappointing." "This certainly gives the government a very important indication that the stimulus measures that have been put in place so far are not delivering the goods in terms of bolstering growth and bolstering private sector confidence," he said. He added that to get the economy back on track, the government will need to propose additional stimulus and confidence-building measures at its annual central economic work conference this week. — Dylan Butts Chinese President Xi Jinping and other top leaders are gearing up for the annual central economic work conference, reportedly set to take place this week, as Beijing strives to boost growth. While an official date for the two-day conclave has yet to be announced, Bloomberg has reported that the closed-door meeting will be held from Dec. 11 to 12. Usually, the annual conference is preceded by the high-profile gathering of the Politburo, the top decision making body led by president Xi. During both meetings, top policymakers will review economic performance and policy implementation in the current year, while setting priorities for the following year, economists at Goldman Sachs said. Read the full story here. — Anniek Bao South Korean Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok urged the National Assembly to speed up the finalization of the country's 2025 budget on Monday, according to a report from local media agency Yonhap. The country's government has been at a legislative standstill in the aftermath of President Yoon Suk Yeol's brief martial law declaration and subsequent events, with discussions on the 2025 budget proposal mostly stalled. Last month, the main opposition Democratic Party had tried to push through a smaller budget bill than that proposed by the ruling party. However, the National Assembly Speaker put the plan on hold, calling on rival parties to compromise. The Democratic Party is now reportedly pushing to pass its version of the budget in a plenary session set for Tuesday. — Dylan Butts China's consumer prices rose less-than-expected in November, climbing 0.2% from a year ago, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics released Monday. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a slight pickup in consumer prices to 0.5% in November from a year ago, versus 0.3% in October. China's producer price index declined for the 26th month. Producer inflation fell by 2.5% year on year in November, less than the estimated 2.8% decline as per the Reuters poll. The persistent near-zero inflation shows that China is still grappling with sluggish domestic demand and deflation at the wholesale level. This is in spite of Beijing's slate of stimulus efforts since September which has included interest rate cuts, support for the stock and property markets as well as efforts to boost bank lending.

As the year-end nears, CNBC Pro asked three fund managers what global stocks they are buying in the lead-up to 2025, as they attempt to get ahead of the curve. CNBC Pro subscribers can read more here. — Amala Balakrishner The S&P 500 is set for more gains in 2025, according to HSBC. The firm said it expects the broad market index to hit 6,700 by the end of next year, which implies more than 10% upside from Thursday's close. The index has already risen more than 27% this year. "While this year's equity rally was a mix of both earnings growth and a valuation re-rating (c50/50), we expect next year's equity returns to be focused on earnings growth as valuations are more stretched," analyst Nicole Inui told clients in a Friday note. "Overall, we expect earnings to grow by 9% incorporating a slower but still resilient US economy and some margin expansion." Inui also said she expects the U.S. economy to slow over the course of the next year but remain resilient as inflation eases. That would enable the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by another 125 basis points, she forecast. — Sean Conlon Despite the threat of tariffs next year, investors should stay bullish on stocks in 2025, according to UBS. "Heading into 2025, we think a constructive stance is warranted on global equities, and on U.S. stocks in particular," the bank wrote in a Friday report. "We note that historically U.S. equities tend to rally into presidential elections and after, with the average gain in the 150 trading days following an election averaging near 5% in data going back to 1928 for the S&P 500." UBS added that the U.S. sectors it views as most attractive are the technology, utilities and financial sectors. — Lisa Kailai Han The U.S. economy added 227,000 jobs in November, marking a sharp rebound from the previous month. Economist polled by Dow Jones expected an increase of 214,000 jobs for the month. Jobs growth for October was revised to 36,000 from 12,000. The unemployment rate came in at 4.2% for November, as was expected. — Fred Imbert Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Following the Federal Reserve adopting a more optimistic stance and Bitcoin hitting a historic $100,000 milestone, this week carries a handful of key earnings reports, inflation data, and some events that could set the tone for 2025. By week’s end, many will shift their focus to holiday celebrations, but for now, investors are keeping a watchful eye on developments in the stock market, eager to gauge how these signals might influence the trajectory of the markets heading into the new year. This week brings a few important earnings. On Monday, Oracle (ORCL+0.48%) Corporation will release its earnings after the closing bell, offering insights into the demand for corporate tech services. On Tuesday, GameStop (GME+7.59%) will take the spotlight with its earnings report, which is also scheduled for after the market close. Wednesday shifts focus to Adobe (ADBE+0.47%), which will reveal its financials at the end of the trading day. Thursday rounds out the week with a series of significant earnings announcements. AI giant Broadcom (AVGO+6.57%) will report its performance, offering clues about the health of the semiconductor and AI-driven technology markets. Retail powerhouse Costco (COST+0.11%) will also release its results, shedding light on consumer spending habits amid shifting economic conditions. This week, key inflation data will be released, providing important insights into the state of the U.S. economy. On Wednesday, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and core CPI data will be published, shedding light on inflationary trends and the cost of living. These reports are closely watched by economists and investors, as they help gauge the effectiveness of monetary policy. On Thursday, the market will receive initial jobless claims data, offering a snapshot of the labor market’s health, along with the Producer Price Index (PPI) and core PPI data. The PPI measures inflation at the wholesale level and provides an early indicator of potential price pressures in the broader economy. Finally, on Friday, the Import Price Index and U.S. retail sales figures will be released. The Import Price Index will highlight changes in the cost of goods imported into the U.S., while retail sales data will offer a look into consumer spending patterns, a key driver of economic growth. Microsoft (MSFT+1.26%) will determine on Tuesday whether to invest in Bitcoin, although the board has recommended voting against the proposal, citing that the company already considers a wide range of investable assets, including Bitcoin. The AI Summit kicks off in New York on Wednesday, bringing together industry leaders and innovators for two days of exploration into how artificial intelligence is transforming lives and reshaping various sectors.

For some of you, Andrew Plotkin will need no introduction. The rest of you ought to know that he’s quite an amazing guy, easily one of the half-dozen most important figures in the history of post-Infocom interactive fiction. By my best reckoning, he’s written an even dozen fully realized, polished text adventures in all, from 1995’s A Change in the Weather, the co-winner of the very first IF Competition, to his 2014 Kickstarter-funded epic Hadean Lands. While he was about it, he made vital technical contributions to interactive fiction as well; perhaps most notably, he invented a new virtual machine called Glulx, which finally allowed games written with the Inform programming language to burst beyond the boundaries of Infocom’s old Z-Machine, while the accompanying Glk input-output library allowed then to make use of graphics, sound, and modern typography. Over the last ten years or so, Andrew — or “Zarf,” as his friends who know him just a little bit better than I do generally call him — has moved into more of an organizing role in the interactive-fiction community, taking steps to place it on a firm footing so that its most important institutions can outlive old-timers like him and me. Andrew was kind enough to sit down with me recently for a wide-ranging conversation that started with his formative years as an Infocom superfan in the 1980s, went on to encompass some of his seminal games and other contributions of the 1990s and beyond, and wound up in the here and now. I hope you’ll enjoy reading this transcript of our discussion as much as I enjoyed chatting with Andrew screen to screen. He’s refreshingly honest about the sweet and the bitter of being a digital creator working mostly in niche forms. One final note before we get started: Andrew is currently available for contract or full-time employment. If you have need of an experienced programmer, systems architect, writer, and/or game designer whose body of work speaks for itself, you can contact him through his website. The munchkin Zarf, 1971. Perhaps we should start with some very general background. Have you lived in the Boston area your whole life? No, not at all! I only moved to Boston in 2005. I was born in 1970 in Syracuse, New York, a place that I don’t remember at all because my family moved to New Jersey when I was about three. We lived there for a couple of years, then my father got a job in the Washington, D.C., area. I went to primary school through high school there. And when and where did you first encounter interactive fiction? It must have been around 1979. My father’s company had a “bring your family to work” day. A teletype there was running Adventure. My father plunked me down in front of it and explained what was going on. I thought it was the best thing in the universe. I banged on it for a couple of hours while everybody else was running around the office, although I didn’t get very far. For the next few months, Dad was playing it at work, illicitly — that was how everybody played it. He would bring home these giant sheets of fan-fold printer paper showing his latest progress. As I recall, I suggested the solution to the troll-bridge puzzle: giving the golden eggs to the troll. That was great, the first adventure-game puzzle I solved. When did you first get a computer at home? Around 1980, we got an Apple II Plus. We acquired the first three Scott Adams games and Zork, which was newly available, plus Microsoft’s port of Adventure to the Apple II. Andrew’s bar mitzvah cake took the form of an Apple II. That started my lifelong attachment to Infocom. I played all the games as they came out. I begged my folks to buy them for me. Later, I spent my own money on them. You played all of the Infocom games upon their first release? Pretty much, up until I went off to college. I remember that I did not play Plundered Hearts when it came out. That one was a hard sell for a lot of young men — although it’s a brilliant game. Yeah. I didn’t play it because I was a seventeen-year-old boy. I also didn’t play Zork Zero or the [illustrated] games that came after it because I had gone off to college and didn’t have the Apple II anymore. But I did catch up with all of them a few years later. You mention that you did get some adventure games from other companies when you first got the Apple II. Did that continue, or were you exclusively loyal to Infocom? Well, I was haunting the download BBSes and snarfing any pirated game I could. I played Wizardry and Ultima. I didn’t play too many other text adventures. I knew they existed — I had seen ads for Mike Berlyn’s pre-Infocom stuff — but I didn’t really hunt them down because I knew that Infocom was actually better at it. I remember that we had The Wizard and the Princess, which was just clunky and weird and not actually solvable. I know that you also wrote some of your own text adventures on the Apple II in BASIC, as a lot of people were doing at this time. Yes. The first one I did was a parody of Enchanter. I called it Enchanter II. It was a joke game that I could upload to the BBSes: “Look, it’s the sequel!” It was very silly. It started out pretending to be an Infocom game, then started throwing in Doctor Who jokes. The closing line was, “You may have lost, but we have gained,” the ending from the Apple II Prisoner game. It was terrible. But I did write it and release it. Unfortunately, as far as I know it’s lost. I’ve never seen it archived anywhere. I did Inhumane after that. That was another parody game, but it was meant to have actual puzzles. It was inspired by the Grimtooth’s Traps role-playing books. I liked the idea of people dying in funny ways. Inhumane is obviously juvenilia, but at the same time it shows some of what was to come in your games. There’s a subversive angle to it: here’s a game full of traps where the objective is to hit all the traps. That’s the way I play a lot of games, but inadvertently. Here that’s the point. Were you heavily into tabletop RPGs? No. Tabletop role-playing I was never into. I get performance anxiety when I’m asked to come up with stories on the fly. I just don’t enjoy sitting at a table and being in that position. It’s not my thing. But I was interested in role-playing scenarios and source books. First, because of the long-term connection to [computer] adventure games, second because they had so much creative world-building and storytelling, just to read. So, yeah. I was interested in tabletop role-playing games but not in actually playing them. A surprising number of people have told me the same: they never played tabletop RPGs much but they liked the source books. For some people, the imagination that goes into those is enough, it seems. So, you go off to university. Why did you choose Carnegie Mellon University? I got rejected by MIT! It was second on the list. Were you aware that Infocom was connected so closely to MIT? No. I knew that they were in Cambridge because I subscribed to the Status Line newsletter. There was a running theme of them mentioning stuff around Cambridge. And I’d played The Lurking Horror. But I didn’t have the full context of “these were MIT students who made Zork at MIT.” I guess it would have made the rejection even more painful if you’d known. At university, you’re exposed to Unix and the Mac for the first time. Yes. And to the Internet. And I started learning “real” programming languages like C. Did you also play games at university? Yes. I ran into roguelikes for the first time. Which ones did you play? I played a fair bit of Advanced Rogue, but I never got good at it. There were people playing NetHack, but it was clear that that was a game where you had to put in a lot of time to make any serious progress. Rogue was a little bit lighter. Yeah. I never was willing to put in the hours and hours that it takes to get good at those games. Now especially, when I write about so many games, I just don’t have the time to devote 200 hours to NetHack. You’ve since re-implemented one of your own programming experiments from university, Praser 5. That was not originally a parser-based text adventure. It was a puzzle stuck inside the CMU filesystem. Every “room” was a directory, connected by symlinks. You literally CDed into the directory and typed “ls,” and the description would pop up in the file listing. Then you would type, “cd up,” “cd left,” whatever, to follow symlinks to other directories. It was an experiment in using the tools of a shared computer system to make an embedded game. The riddles were a matter of running a small executable which was linked in each directory. I used file permissions to give people access to more things as they solved more puzzles. Much later, after I had learned Inform 6, I did the parser version. What did you do right after university? I graduated in 1992, but I wanted to stick around the Pittsburgh area because a lot of my friends hadn’t graduated yet. I got a job in the CMU computer-science department and shacked up with a couple of classmates in a rundown apartment. That was great. I bought my first Macintosh and started writing stuff on it. That’s when I started working on System’s Twilight. I figured it was time for me to get into my games career. I decided to write a game and release it as shareware to make actual money. So, I bought a tremendous number of Macintosh programming manuals, which I still have. System’s Twilight has the fingerprints of Cliff Johnson of Fool’s Errand fame all over it. Yes. It was an homage. When did you first play his games? Was that at university? Yeah. Those came out between 1988 and 1992, when I was there. I had a campus job, so I could afford a couple of games. I played them on the campus Macintoshes. I remember very well being in one of the computer clusters at two in the morning, solving the final meta-puzzle of The Fool’s Errand. I had written down all of the clues the game had fed me on papers that were spread out all over the desk. Every time I used one of the clues, I’d grab the piece of paper, crumple it up, and throw it over my shoulder. When I finished, the desk was empty and I was surrounded by paper. We had an amazing experience with The Fool’s Errand as well. My wife fell in love with it. It was our obsession for two weeks. When I talked to Cliff Johnson years ago, my wife told me to tell him that he was the only man other than me that she could see herself marrying. I wasn’t sure how to take that. What were your expectations for System’s Twilight? I intended to make some money. I didn’t know how much would show up or whether it would lead to more things. It was just something I could do that would be a lot more fun than the programming I was doing in my day job. Now that you had your own Macintosh and a steady income, I guess you started buying more commercial games again? I know you have a huge love for Myst, which came out around this time. I was actually a little bit late to Myst. I didn’t play it until 1994, when everybody was already talking about it. But when you did, it was love at first sight? Yeah. The combination of the environment and the soundscape was great and the puzzles were fun. It felt like someone was finally doing the graphical adventure right. I’d never gotten into the LucasArts and Sierra versions of graphical adventures because they were sort of parodic, and the environments weren’t actually attractive. They were very pixelated. They just weren’t trying to be immersive. But Myst was doing it right. As long as we’re on the subject: I guess Riven absolutely blew your mind? Yes, it did. It was vastly larger and more interesting and more cohesively thought-through than Myst had been. I played it obsessively and solved it and was very happy. At what point did you get involved with the people who would wind up being the founders of a post-Infocom interactive-fiction community? In 1993 or 1994, someone pointed me to an open-source Infocom interpreter. I hadn’t really been aware of the technology stack behind Infocom’s games. But now you could pull all of the games off of the Lost Treasures disks and run them on Unix machines. That was kind of interesting. I don’t remember how I encountered the rec.arts.int-fiction newsgroup. But when I did, people were talking about reverse-engineering the Infocom technology. I wrote an interpreter of my own for [Unix] X Windows that had proportional fonts, command-line editing, command history, scroll bars — all the stuff we take for granted nowadays. I released that, then ported it to the Macintosh. That was my first major interaction with rec.arts.int-fiction. It must have been around this time that Kevin Wilson made a very historically significant post on Usenet, announcing the very first IF Competition. You submitted A Change in the Weather and won the Inform category. Did you write that game specifically for the Comp? Let me back up a little bit. In early 1995, I got an offer from a game company in Washington, D.C, called Magnet Interactive, to port games from 3DO to Macintosh. So, I moved to Washington — I was very sad to leave Pittsburgh behind — and rented a terrible little rundown apartment there. I was also making some money from System’s Twilight, and had started working on a sequel, which was to be called Moondials. It was a slog. I had some ideas for puzzles, but the story was just not coming together. So, when Kevin Wilson said, “Hey, let’s do this thing,” I said, “I’m going to take a break from Moondials and write a text adventure very fast.” The process started with downloading Inform 5 and the manual and reading it. I think I blasted through the manual five times in a week. The start of the Competition was a little weird because we didn’t yet have the idea of all of the games being made available at the same time. Kevin just said, “Upload your games to the IF Archive.” So, all of the games trickled in at different times. For the second Comp, we settled very firmly on the idea of all games being released at the same time because the 1995 experience was not very satisfactory. I know that it’s always frustrating to be asked where ideas come from. But sometimes it’s unavoidable, so I’m going to ask it about A Change in the Weather. I think I was drawing on the general sense of being an introvert and not making friends easily — being separated from people and feeling alienated from my social group. My college experience wasn’t solidly that. I was an introvert, but I was at a computer college, and there were a lot of introverts and introvert-centered social groups. I had friends, had housemates after college, as I said. But I still struggled somewhat with social activities. It was a failure mode I was always aware of, that I might end up on the edge not really talking to people. I drew on that experience in general in creating the scenario of A Change in the Weather. That’s interesting. From my outsider perspective, I can see that much more in So Far, your next game. It really dwells on this theme of alienation and connection, or the lack thereof. That also strikes me as the game of yours that’s most overtly influenced by Myst. Just from the nature of the environment and the magical-mechanical puzzles. It’s not deserted like Myst, but you can’t interact in any meaningful way with the people who are there — which goes back to this theme of alienation. I wasn’t thinking of Myst specifically there, but it was part of my background by that point. The direct emotional line in So Far was breaking up with my college girlfriend. That was a couple of years in the past by this point. That had been in Pittsburgh. A lot of the energy for working on System’s Twilight came from suddenly being stuck at home after that relationship ended. I channeled my frustrations into programming. But then I tried to drop it into So Far as a theme of people being separated. None of the specifics of what had happened were relevant to the game — just the feeling. By the time of So Far, you were as big as names get in modern interactive fiction. Your next game Lists and Lists was arguably not a game at all. What made you decide to write a LISP tutorial as interactive fiction? Do you have a special relationship with LISP? Yes! I hate it! I had taken functional-programming courses in college and learned LISP. But I just did not jibe with it at all. That’s ironic because Infocom’s programming language ZIL was heavily based on LISP. Right. It was an MIT thing, but it was not my thing. Nevertheless, the concept of building it into the Z-Machine with a practical limit of 64 K of RAM — or really less than that — seemed doable. And I had written a LISP interpreter as a programming exercise during my first or second year in college. So, I was aware of the basics. Doing it in Inform wasn’t a gigantic challenge, just a certain amount of work. Were you already starting to feel restless with the traditional paradigm of interactive fiction? Right after Lists and Lists, you released The Space Under the Window, which might almost work better if it was implemented in hypertext. It’s almost interactive poetry. I wasn’t bored with traditional games, but I did want to try different things and see what could be done. And writing in Inform was simple enough that I could just whip out an idea and see whether it worked. That was inspiring the whole community at this point. That was the lesson of the first IF Comp: you can just sit down and try an idea, and a month later people will be talking about it. There was a very rapid fermentation cycle. Yes. It led to much more formal experimentation. Before the Comp came along, everybody was trying to follow the Infocom model and make big games. But if you have an idea that’s more conceptual or avant garde, it’s often better suited to a smaller game. The Comp created a space for that. If you do something and submit it to the Comp, even if it’s highly experimental, it will get played and noticed and discussed. Now we come to The Big One of your games in many people’s eyes. And I must admit that this applies to me as well. Spider and Web is such a brilliantly conceived game. I’m in awe of this game. So, thank you for that. You’re welcome. It’s always tricky to have a game which is so purely built out of a single idea because then, when you try to write another game, you think you have to come up with another idea that’s as good, and it’s never possible. Was this idea born out of any particular experience, perhaps with other media? I don’t think it was. I was prying into what we would now call the triangle of identities — prying into the idea that what the game’s text is telling you is a point of view that might have biases behind it. There is a dialog between what the player thinks about the world and what the game thinks about the world, and there can be cracks in between. That led to the idea of using the storytelling of the game to tell a lie, and that there is a truth behind it which can be discerned. I started with that kernel and started coming up with puzzle scenarios. Here is an outcome that is verifiable. But there’s two different versions of what happened that could have led to that outcome. I’m going to tell one, but the other is going to be the truth. I strung together a few different versions of that. Then I said, okay, if we’re lying, then the introduction of the game has to introduce the lie. So I folded that in from the start. I knew that I wanted a two-part structure: you learn what’s going on, then you make use of all of the information. The moment of transition between the two is often referred to as simply The Puzzle. It’s been called the best single text-adventure puzzle ever created. Did you realize how special it was at the time? No. I figured it would be a puzzle. I didn’t understand how much of an impact it would have. I knew that I wanted to surprise players by having a possibility suddenly become available. Here’s a thing that I can do, and I will do it. Any kind of good puzzle solution is a surprise when you think of it. Afterward it seems obvious. I knew I had a good combination of elements to make it work, but I wasn’t thinking about the way that it would reorient the entire history of the game in the player’s head in one fell swoop. I don’t know. Maybe I had an inkling. What I love is that the game is called Spider and Web. Suddenly when you solve that puzzle, those two categories get reversed. Who is really the spider and who is caught in the web? The reason I called it Spider and Web was actually the old idiom “What a tangled web we weave when we practice to deceive.” The notion of deception was meant to be part of the title, and the spider was there just to go with the web. But yes, it’s multi-valent. I know you’re a big reader of science fiction and fantasy. I wouldn’t picture you reading a James Bond novel. What made you decide to go in the direction of spy fiction here? Honestly, I thought of it as science fiction. The spy fiction was merely because the story was about deception, and somebody had to be fooling somebody. But conceptually, I had it pinned as a science-fiction scenario from some kind of dystopian cold war, but with magically advanced technology. You entered Hunter, in Darkness into the 1999 IF Comp. It’s a riff on Hunt the Wumpus, which is about the most minimalist imaginable text adventure, if you can even call it that. Your game, by contrast, is a lushly atmospheric, viscerally horrifying fiction. Were you just being cheeky? Yeah, I was. I just wanted to put in all the stuff that Wumpus didn’t have, without getting away from the core concept. I thought it would be a funny thing to do. I worked really hard on the claustrophobia and the creepy bats. I remember crawling under a chair to try to get the feel of being in a narrow passage and not being able to move around — just to get the bodily sense of that. Then we have Shade from 2000, which is another of my favorites of your games. Even more than Hunter, in Darkness, it has a horror vibe. Yes. I leaned into it harder in Shade. There are all kinds of opinions about what is really going on in Shade. I know you like to let people draw their own conclusions about your games, so I won’t press you on that… I don’t think there’s a lot of disagreement on the main point, that you’re dying and this is all a hallucination. Yeah, that was absolutely my take on it, that you’re dying of thirst in the desert. I saw it pointed out in a review that everything you’re trying to do is the opposite of the real problem you have. You’re trying to get out of your apartment in the hallucination, but your real problem is that you are out, lost in the desert. Was that something you were consciously doing, or are we all reading too much into it? Well, neither. I don’t think I was consciously thinking that way, but that doesn’t mean that you’re reading stuff into it. It’s deliberately ambiguous. I had a lot of images in my head that I threw out at random. I did have the notion that this environment in your apartment was from your past. You really had packed up your apartment and called a taxi and gotten out, and reiterating it was… inappropriate but real. It was in your head while you were having this terrible experience, and it was being replayed by your brain in a broken way. You’re in a place of blinding light — it’s very hot — and the experience you’re replaying is very dim and dark, except that when light occurs it’s painful. A rare 1999 meeting in the flesh of interactive-fiction luminaries. From left: Andrew Plotkin, Chris Klimas, David Dyte, and Adam Cadre. Although your games of the 1990s are fondly remembered and still played, you were also making major technical contributions. Probably most important was the Glulx — sorry, I can’t say that word! — virtual machine to let Inform games expand beyond the strictures of Infocom’s old Z-Machine. How did that come about? No one knows how to pronounce it! I started to think about it in probably 1996, when Graham [Nelson] came out with version 7 and 8 of the Z-Machine. Version 8 was big — big enough for Graham’s Jigsaw — but it was still just a stopgap. It was only twice as big as Infocom’s version 5. There were all kinds of things that didn’t scale. It seemed worthwhile to make a fresh design that would be 32-bit from the start. I just didn’t want to deal with more incremental changes. And being able to jettison all of the weird legacy stuff about the Z-Machine seemed like a win too — being able to rethink all of these decisions in a technological context that is not 1979. One of the things I wanted to do was to separate out the input-output layer. I had already written Z-Machine interpreters for X Windows and Mac that used Mark Howell’s ZIP engine with different interface front-ends. When TADS went open-source around 1997, I made an interpreter for that. So, now I had this matrix, right? I’ve got an X Windows front-end and a Mac front-end, and they both slap onto the Z-Machine and the TADS virtual machine. In a pretty clear way, these things are just plug and play. All the virtual machine does is accept text input and generate text output. I mean, yes, there’s the status line, maybe sound and graphics, but fundamentally that’s what it’s doing. And the front-end presents that text in a way that suits the platform on which it’s running. I was doing the same thing that Infocom did, just slicing it into more layers. Infocom had an interpreter and a game file. I said, we’re going to have an interpreter engine and an interpreter front-end. Thus there will be more flexibility. I designed the front-end first, the Glk library. I made an implementation for Mac and for X Windows and for the Unix command line. Then I started thinking about the virtual machine. I ripped apart the Inform 6 compiler so it could compile to Glulx from the same game source code. As I recall, the Glulx virtual machine is bigger than the Z-Machine — for all practical purposes, its capacity is infinite — but also simpler. There’s less of the hard-coded stuff that Infocom included, like the object tables. Yes, exactly. I figured the more generic and simple I could make it, the better. It would be simpler to design and simpler to implement. It adds complexity to the compiler, but the compiler already needs code to generate object tables in a specific format. It would still be doing that, but there wouldn’t be any hardware support for them. I’d just have to include veneer routines to handle object tables in this format. Then, if we ever need to change the format, no problem. We just change the compiler. We don’t need to change the virtual machine. When did you publish the Glulx specification? April 1, 1999. Were you still living in Washington, D.C., at this time? I had moved around a lot, actually. The job in D.C. only lasted about a year and a half. After the porting project I had been doing finished up, the company dropped me onto a project to do a Highlander licensed game, which we had absolutely no concept of how to do. This would have been like a 3D action game. That project got canned. Then I worked for a document company in Maryland for a while. Then I moved back to Pittsburgh and worked for a startup. The startup got acquired by Red Hat, and they moved us down to North Carolina. That was from like 1999 to 2000. Then Red Hat fired us and I moved back to Pittsburgh. From 2000 to 2005 I worked for a filesystem company in Pittsburgh. You took a break from writing interactive fiction for a few years after Shade. Then there was a little bit of a shift in focus when you did come back in 2004 with The Dreamhold. Your earlier games don’t try too hard to be accessible. When you returned, you seemed more interested in outreach and accessibility. What was the thought process there? Only the obvious one. It’s true that all of my previous games were written very much for the community. They were written for people who knew how IF worked. But The Dreamhold was specifically an outreach game. I wanted to try to expand the community. We’d been doing this for about ten years at that point, and it was kind of the same crowd of people. I thought to create an outreach game as a total wild-ass experiment to try to bring in people from other parts of the gaming world. I didn’t know whether it would work, but I figured it was worth a try. So I designed a game specifically for that purpose, built around explaining how traditional interactive fiction worked to people who didn’t know how to play it. That meant doing some wacky stuff. There are some rooms in The Dreamhold that you enter by going north, but to go back you have to go east, because I figured, this is really uncomfortable, but people are going to run into this if they get into IF, so they should be familiar with the concept. I’ll try to introduce it as smoothly as possible by putting messages like, “The corridor turns as you head to the north.” Then put in the [room] description, “You can go back the way you came, toward the east,” to try to make it more tangible. But I wanted to introduce complicated maps and darkness and all of the hardcore stuff that the community was used to. And also make it fun. There were a number of these outreach efforts at the time. Some people were taking IF games to more conventional game jams. There were cheat sheets of “how to play IF” going around. My impression is that these efforts weren’t super successful. Is that your impression as well? Yes, it is. None of it actually worked. It’s great that we made the on-ramps and it’s good that we still maintain them, but there was not a huge influx of new people coming onto the scene at that point. My impression is that the community didn’t really start to grow until it opened itself up to non-parser-driven games: the Twine games and ChoiceScript games and so on. Presumably some percentage of those players became willing to try the parser games as well. Yeah, but that was a little bit later, after 2010 or so. There was still a gap. I decided, well, The Dreamhold didn’t make an impact, so I’m just going to go back to writing wacky puzzle games. Of course, in 2007 Inform 7 came out. I would say that drew people into creating games, because it was much more approachable for people who were not C programmers. There was a bit of a revolution there. It was just harder to see because it was new authors rather than new players. The time around 2010 was an exciting one for you personally as well as the community. In addition to the ongoing buzz about Inform 7, Jason Scott released his Get Lamp documentary, and you launched a Kickstarter to make a game called Hadean Lands soon after. Yes. In 2010, Jason Scott premiered Get Lamp at PAX East. He had interviewed me two or three years earlier — probably in 2007. Yeah, he worked on that movie for almost ten years. Exactly. It’s kind of funny to look back at 2007 and see me talking about releasing commercial interactive fiction. But in 2010, all of the old Infocom guys showed up at PAX East. I was on that panel, sitting with Dave Lebling, Brian Moriarty, and Steve Meretzky. I was going… [genuflecting] PAX East, 2010. From left: Dave Lebling, Don Woods, Brian Moriarty, Andrew Plotkin, Nick Montfort, Steve Meretzky, and Jason Scott. (Photo by Eric Havir.) I’m not worthy! Exactly. Jason Scott brought Get Lamp to a game class at Tufts University a few weeks later. Since I was living about half a mile away, I came in and said, “Hi, I’m in this movie.” Afterward, I went up to Jason and said, “You know, people are talking about interactive fiction for the first time in fifteen years outside of our little community. Do you think I should do a Kickstarter for a giant IF game?” And Jason looks at me like I’ve got bananas growing out of my ears and says, “Yes, you should!” He’s the most enthusiastic person in the world. Yes. And of course, he’d just done a Kickstarter for the Get Lamp release. This was early for Kickstarter. There had been gaming Kickstarter projects before, but no really gigantic ones. So, getting $30,000 for an IF Kickstarter was kind of a big deal in 2010. So I went to the boss at my day job and said, “Well, I guess this is it for us. I’m quitting.” I knew that $30,000 wasn’t actually going to last me very long, living in Boston. But of course, I’d been in the software industry for decades by this point, so I had a fair amount of savings cushion built up. And I had a pile of Red Hat stock which was worth some money. I could live on it while I found my footing as an indie developer. The Dreamhold had taken me nine months. I thought Hadean Lands would take me a year. Ha! It turned out that writer’s block is a hell of a thing. Hadean Lands kept getting sidelined. I got totally knocked over by the idea of doing a hypertext MUD. I spent a year writing that. That was Seltani, which was hugely popular for about two months in the Myst fan community; I did it as a Myst fan game and presented it at a Myst convention. Everybody loved it. But I wasn’t writing Hadean Lands, and eventually my KickStarter backers started to get upset about that. I did slog through it. I got Hadean Lands done [in 2014]. I don’t feel like the story is hugely successful, but I’m very happy with the puzzle structure and the game layout. As you know as well as I do, there’s a whole checkered history of people trying to monetize IF. A few years ago, Bob Bates of Infocom and Legend fame released Thaumistry. I was a beta-tester on that game. The game was very good, but these things just never work. It’s always a disappointment in the end. Nobody has ever cracked that code. If you look at the Thaumistry Kickstarter and the Hadean Lands Kickstarter, you see that they made almost the same amount of money from almost the same number of backers. It’s the same crowd showing up: “Yeah, we still love ya!” But they’re not enough to make a living from… The problem is getting outside of that crowd. It’s no wonder that people like Emily Short have long since decamped, saying, “I have to work on different kinds of games with a larger reach.” What about you? Do you think you will ever return to parser-based interactive fiction? That’s a fair question. I’ve had a lot of starts toward things that I thought might be interesting. I started working on a framework for a kind of text game that’s not parser-based but also not hypertext in the sense that Twine is. It’s more combinatoric. I got two-thirds of the way done with building the engine and one-third of the way done with writing a game, then I kind of lost it. But I still think it’s interesting and I might go back to it. I don’t think it would go big the way Twine did, but it might reach a different audience. It’s a different way of thinking about the game structure. Would you care to talk about your partnership with Jason Shiga to turn his interactive comic books into digital apps? I have played Meanwhile, the first of those. Sure. I’d been aware of Jason Shiga ever since I started hanging out with Nick Montfort at MIT after I moved to Boston. Nick had a bunch of his early self-published stuff. He had the original printing of Meanwhile, as a black-and-white hand-cut book. I thought it was really neat. Totally by coincidence, Meanwhile got picked up by a publisher just before that 2010 PAX East we talked about. A nice big hardback version of it was published. It was being sold at PAX East. I thought, man, this is great, I’d really love to do an iPhone version. This was 2010; iPhone games were big. A little later, I did the Hadean Lands Kickstarter and quit my job. I needed to have more projects than just one text adventure, so I wrote to Jason Shiga and said, “Hey, I’m a big fan. I’d love to do an app version of your book.” Jason was amenable, so we had the usual conversations with lawyers and agents and signed a contract. I worked on that at the same time that I was planning out Hadean Lands. The iPhone app came out in 2011. So, the finances of making a go of it as an independent creator of digital content without a day job didn’t quite pan out for you in the end. I feel your pain, believe me. It’s a hard row to hoe. What came next? After Meanwhile and Hadean Lands, I felt very stuck. Jason [Shiga] was off working on non-interactive comics, so there wasn’t anything to do there. I bummed around for a while trying to find something that would make any kind of money at all, but I was not successful. I’m skipping over huge chunks of time here, but in 2017 Emily Short and Aaron Reed were working on a project to do NPC dialog as a commercial product. It was essentially taking Emily’s old ideas about threaded dialog in parser games and turning them into a plugin which game designers could use in any game to have interesting multi-threaded conversations. I spent a couple of years working on that project with them. But it turned out that management at that company sucked and everybody bailed. Since then until this year, I’ve been working for big and small games studios, working on the dialog parts of their games. Coding dialog engines or writing dialog? I’ve been a software engineer, working on the coding part, but working with the writers. Also during this period, Jason Shiga started writing what he calls “Adventuregame Comics,” which are shorter Meanwhile-style books. I’ve started porting those. The Steam port of The Beyond and the iOS and Steam port of Leviathan are available now. The iOS port of The Beyond will be coming later. Since Hadean Lands, you’ve stepped into more of an organizing role in the IF community. Yes. I’m very proud to have transitioned from being a hotshot game writer to someone who is doing community support, building structures and traditions and conferences. I never wanted to be a person who was only famous for writing games, especially after I started writing fewer games. I really didn’t want to be a person who was famous for having been a big game writer in the 1990s. That’s a sucky position to be stuck in. There needs to be a second act. It’s maybe a maturation process as well. When you get a little bit older, you realize that some things are important in a way you may not have when you were a young, hotshot game writer. Yeah. I slowed down writing games because I started to second-guess myself too much. When you’ve written a lot of games that people got really excited about… Then you’re competing with your own back catalog. It doesn’t feel good. I’ve had trouble getting away from that. You’ve done most of your organizational work in the context of the Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation, so maybe we should talk about that more specifically. I’ll give you my impression of the reasons for its founding, and you can tell me if I’m right. You and some other people decided it would be wise to institutionalize things a little bit more, so that the community is no longer so dependent on individuals who come and go. With a foundation and a funding model and all of these institutional aspects, hopefully you set up the community for the long haul, so that it can survive if a server goes down or someone goes away. Yeah, that’s exactly where it started. We’d been running for decades on people just setting up a server somewhere and saying, “Hey, I’ll run this thing!” That was the original IF Archive, the Usenet newsgroups, IF Comp, the Interactive Fiction Database, the IF Forum. It was workable, but everything was being paid out of somebody’s pocket. There wasn’t a lot of discussion about who was doing what or how much it cost. There was no fallback plan and no thinking about what would come next if somebody stopped doing something. Like, there was a long period when IFDB wasn’t getting any updates because Mike Roberts had a day job. Some things about it were clunky and hard to use, but you couldn’t fix them. So, in 2015 or early 2016, Jason McIntosh, who was running the IF Comp at that point, had a conversation with somebody who said, “Why don’t you have a non-profit organization to support the IF Comp? Then you could get donations from people.” And Jason started running around in circles with a gleam in his eye, saying, “Yes! We should do this! We should do this! Whom do I know who can help?” He started talking to other people who were longtime supporters of things in the community. That included Chris Klimas, who had been supporting Twine for three or four years, and me — I’d been supporting the IF Archive for a while. Then Carolyn VanEseltine and Flourish Klink joined. Flourish was the only one who knew how to set up a non-profit. They had run a Harry Potter fan conference as a teenager, and, being excited and not knowing things were hard, had just done it. We got into contact with the same lawyer Flourish had used. The lawyer told us what we needed: forms, bylaws, etc. Jason was the first president, I was the first treasurer. We went down to my bank and opened a business account for the organization. Then we wrote to the IRS to become a 501 C3 non-profit. We set up a website, found someone to give us a basic Web design and a logo. Then we announced it. At the start, we just did the IF Comp; we collected about $8000 that first year for a prize pool. But over the course of the first couple of years, we added Twine and the IF Archive. The IF Forum was the next big addition. Then the IF Wiki and IFDB. Today each has its own steering group. And we have a grants committee now. The NarraScope conference is another IFTF project. Would you like to tell a bit about that? That was my idea. I’d always been keen on the idea of having a narrative-game-oriented conference. I’d been going to GDC for many years. GDC has a sub-track, a narrative-game summit, which is where people like Emily Short and Jon Ingold hang out. But it’s a very tiny slice of what GDC is. And of course GDC is expensive, so it’s hard to bring in the hobbyists and the indie people and the people who write IF Comp games. They just can’t afford GDC. I wanted to provide an alternative that was more approachable and affordable and friendly. Once we as an organization had steady members and contributors and could bring in money, I said, “It’s time to think about a conference. Our first de novo project.” So, I talked to people I knew who had been involved in conferences, like the Myst fan conference, which is a very tiny thing that happens every year, like 100 people. But it’s been going for years and years. And of course Flourish had run a fan conference. In 2017 or 2018, I went to GDC with a bunch of business cards that said, “We want to run an interactive-fiction, adventure, and narrative-oriented game conference. Want to help us?” I handed one to everybody I talked to. I found a bunch of people who were interested in helping. Nick Montfort said he could get us a space at MIT for the event relatively cheap. We put up a call for speakers, a website, etc. We were coordinating with the IFTF Education Committee, which is run by Judith Pintar, who goes all the way back to Shades of Gray. Yeah, I had a great talk with Judith some years ago now. I had strong opinions about how a friendly conference should feel. We had to bring in lunch so people would sit around and have conversations rather than splitting up and running all over Cambridge. I wanted long breaks between talks so people would have space to socially interact. I wanted badges that didn’t distinguish between speakers and attendees; we’re all here, and we’re not going to have superstars. I wanted an open and honest tone. We made sure to have a keynote speaker who wasn’t an old fart. We didn’t want somebody like Scott Adams coming in and talking about what it was like back in the 1980s. You didn’t want to become a retro-gaming conference. Right. And we deliberately made the scope larger than just interactive fiction as found in the IF Comp or the IFDB. We didn’t want to limit the conference to those topics. We kept the admission price down to about $85. That was 2019. We had about 250 people, and everything miraculously went perfectly. The worst disaster was when the Dunkin’ Donuts guy was dropping off coffee and hot cocoa. One of the urns blew its spout and dumped gallons of cocoa all over the floor. Someone said, “I know where there’s a mop,” and went and got the mop and cleaned it up. Great, let’s have the rest of the conference! Local game companies made contributions, maybe $500 or $1000. Between that and the registration fees, the conference broke even. I admit that I threw in $2000 myself to make it balance, but that was because we splurged out and rented a bar on Sunday night. I said, okay, I’ll cover that, so that everybody can go out and have pizza and beer. A dream achieved: Andrew closes the 2019 NarraScope conference in Boston. Time for pizza and beer! It was a huge success. We said we would do it again next year. But of course next year was 2020. You know how that story goes. But it was exciting enough that we wanted to keep going anyway, so we had an online event in 2020. We skipped 2021, then came back in 2022 with an online conference. Then we had a hybrid model for 2023 in Pittsburgh and 2024 in Rochester. And that’s the history of the thing in a nutshell. By now I’ve become just an advisor, which is a great relief. How many people have attended the later conferences? It’s very easy to attend an online conference, so about 500 or 600 people signed up for those. But in person in Pittsburgh, there were about 100, either because people didn’t want to travel in the pandemic era or because we were offering an online option, so a lot of people who could have showed up decided to stay home and watch the stream instead. This year was a little higher, like 120. You were at the Strong Museum of Play in Rochester this year? Yeah. The space was spread out, which turned out to be a win, because we had to walk through the museum and walk past all the cool exhibits. People were jumping out between talks to explore the museum. It was a really neat space — but unfortunately more expensive than a university. And there will be another conference in 2025? There absolutely will. It’s going to be in Philadelphia at Drexel University. NarraScope has not yet become big enough to replace GDC, but we’re optimistic. [smile] I don’t think you want that. It becomes very bureaucratic and soulless. Yeah, obviously. But Justin Bortnick, who is the current IFTF president, has been talking to GDC about booth space to present IFTF on the show floor. The Video Game History Foundation had a booth there this year. We thought, we’re educational too! We could do that! It may actually happen. Maybe we can wind up this conversation by talking about the current status of the IF community itself. For many years, it seemed to be quite stagnant in terms of numbers. We already talked about the outreach efforts that took place around 2005 and largely did not succeed. But about five years later, the hypertext systems started to come online. There was a big jump at that point. If you look at the number of games entered in the Comp, they actually trend down through the 2000s, then suddenly there’s a big spike around 2010 to 2012. They’ve stayed at quite a high level since then. Do you have a sense of whether these new, presumably younger people are jumping over to the parser-based stuff as well? There are new faces on both sides. There is now an active group of retro-fans interested in parser games. That is, people who are excited about making new games and running them on Commodore 64s and the like. We had to update Inform to fix the support for the version 3 Z-Machine, which had been broken over time as everybody was writing bigger and bigger games. Now people want to write small games again. And there is more interest in hybrid systems, intermediate models which are neither pure hypertext nor pure parser. For years and years, there were no new parser tools. I thought the last great parser development systems had already been implemented; people would stick with TADS 3 and Inform 7 forever. Then a parser system called Dialog appeared, which is a little bit different from them. But there is certainly more energy on the hypertext side, especially because a lot of us old farts have drifted away. I’m not writing games anymore, Emily Short isn’t writing text games anymore, Jon Ingold and Aaron Reed went off and did their things, Adam Cadre went off to work on film scripts. There are new people writing new games, but I think the pool is going to shrink over time. But that’s okay. Everything that Jon Ingold has done at Inkle Studios is informed by the early text games he worked on and how he wanted to expand that to reach a bigger audience. Everything Sam Barlow has done — Her Story, Telling L!es, Immortality — is informed by his experience writing text games. The same goes for Emily Short. It’s still part of the conversation. It’s just not the center of it anymore. Yeah. This is a discussion I’ve had from time to time since I started this site. My opinion is that when our generation dies that will probably mark the end of parser-based text adventures. You can say that’s tragic if you want to. At the same time, though, nobody’s writing plays like Shakespeare anymore, but Shakespeare’s plays are still out there. And there’s still theater. Yeah. Trends in interactive media, just the same as others forms of entertainment and art, come and go. They have their time, and then their time is over. I’m quite at peace with that. I’m sort of handicapped by the fact that I haven’t played IF Comp games in quite a while. I haven’t either. To be honest, I’ve played almost nothing made in the last ten years, just because I have so many old games on the syllabus for this site. Having too many games to play is not the worst problem to have, but it’s made me kind of a time traveler. I live in the past in that sense. I do know that this year’s IF Comp winner was by Chandler Groover. I don’t think he’s our age. Ryan Veeder is younger than us. I do look at the Comp website sometimes to see what’s going on. I’ve noticed that it still seems to be a parser-based game that actually wins the thing most of the time. That’s a sign of something, I guess. Yeah. Maybe it’s a sign of old farts hanging on too long? But seriously, I think there is a new generation of parser-game authors. Whether it’s big enough to sustain itself after you and I are doddering in a nursing home, I don’t know. There’s been so much progress with computer understanding of natural language. A lot of it is associated with large language models, of course, which is a fraught subject in itself. But I could imagine a system — a front-end — that could take natural language and translate that into something a traditional parser could more readily understand, then funnel it through even an old text adventure. I’m kind of surprised I haven’t heard of anything like that. Someone did do that as an experiment and posted about it on the forum. Experimenting both with using LLMs on the input side to translate natural language into parserese, and also on the output side to translate generic room descriptions into more flowery, expanded text. I’m more interested in the input side because I like hand-crafted output, but that’s getting into the whole question of AI. Yes, I have no interest whatsoever in reading AI-generated text in any context. I think there wasn’t a lot of uptake on that idea just because the kind of people who are excited about AI aren’t excited about parser games in the first place. There have been several attempts to make an AI-generated text adventure, but they’ve all been by people who were not good at text adventures and didn’t know what they wanted out of it. There’s AI Dungeon, which uses an LLM to pretend to be a parser game. But because it’s all AI generated, it doesn’t really produce anything interesting. The people who are interested in making parser games are mostly old-fashioned artisans who want to hand-craft everything and are not motivated to dive into AI as a shiny new pool. It might be different if someone who was an established parser-game author jumped in and wholeheartedly tried to make it happen. Revolutions are the result of one person getting involved and building something that takes off. Someone has to actually do the work. And to this point, nobody has done that. It’s very possible the whole AI thing will collapse in six months anyway. I think that’s a very good possibility, but I think that if it does, it will leave behind some pieces in the rubble that are actually useful. Maybe a solution to our parsing problems can be one of them. But I’ve kept you long enough. Thanks so much for the talk! Thank you! Did you enjoy this article? If so, please think about pitching in to help me make many more like it. You can pledge any amount you like.

I should say, the cake was the work of my mother, Diane. Full credit there. It was tasty. :) Disco Godfather December 7, 2024 at 5:42 pm Just wanted to comment that cake looked awesome. Moms making birthday cakes is something I miss from that era! Matt Campbell December 6, 2024 at 5:39 pm As soon as I read that Andrew worked for a startup that got acquired by Red Hat, I thought of “Being Andrew Plotkin”, which I played, many years after its release. For some reason, when I played the game, I assumed that it was set at Red Hat simply because that was a company with some nerdy “cool factor” in 2000. Of course, I should have figured that the author would know where Andrew worked and write the game accordingly. It sucks that Red Hat fired Andrew’s team. Andrew Plotkin December 6, 2024 at 5:52 pm Oh, I couldn’t move back to Pittsburgh fast enough. The Raleigh/Durham area was _not_ my home base. (Although, as it happened, Stephen Granade was living in Durham. So we got to hang out for that year.) Anyhow, the pile of Red Hat stock was excellent compensation for my trouble. Jason Dyer December 6, 2024 at 5:44 pm >Yeah. This is a discussion I’ve had from time to time since I started this site. My opinion is that when our generation dies that will probably mark the end of parser-based text adventures. You can say that’s tragic if you want to. At the same time, though, nobody’s writing plays like Shakespeare anymore, but Shakespeare’s plays are still out there. Oof. But I don’t disagree, necessarily. We did have radio plays finally come back to life with podcasts, but I still don’t know what will do it with parser fiction. Maybe if a super-famous streamer gets into text adventures. The most prominent streamer I know who is a regular parser player is BillBull (did Gnome Ranger recently) but he’s at the level of 100-150 viewers, not the thousands. I do have two current projects which are text-game adjacent but in the non-disclosure phase, unfortunately. However, they’re along the lines of Ingold etc. where they’re in a slightly more popular slot. I can’t even imagine trying to sell a parser game now, except for maybe getting the Infocom collection from Microsoft and giving it the same treatment Atari and Llamasoft got from Digital Eclipse. The only thing I still find is present in “the youth conversation” is Zork. They know about it. Zork: Grand Inquisitor is one of the official games on the Archipelago randomizer. I sometimes feel like with some of the really obscure games I write about I’m going to be the last one in history who ever plays it, so I try my best to give them all a good showing even if they’re a 30 minute game off a weird tapemag. Matt Campbell December 6, 2024 at 6:05 pm > However, they’re along the lines of Ingold etc. where they’re in a slightly more popular slot. Unfortunately, when I read that, I mentally translate it as “likely not accessible to blind people.” That’s what tends to happen when you take a game that’s text and choice based at its core and wrap it in something like Unity to give it mainstream appeal, as Inkle did. Text-based parser games tend to be accessible by default (in this sense, if not in the wider sense of being approachable to the mainstream), simply because of the constraints of the original medium and the variety of available interpreters (though some interpreters, like Gargoyle, weren’t screen-reader-accessible last time I checked). Yes, yes, I should revive my long-dormant screen reader accessibility plugin for Unity. I presented a proof-of-concept demo at NarraScope 2022 (Andrew happened to be the one who introduced that talk). At this point I’d be happy to hand off the project to someone else who has more familiarity with (and patience for) Unity than I have. Jason Dyer December 6, 2024 at 6:09 pm Nah, we’ve got voice acting. Daniel Maxson December 11, 2024 at 9:45 pm > Text-based parser games tend to be accessible by default FWIW, Ink’s default web export output is also screen reader accessible. But yeah, you’re probably not going to be making a living from that (although Choice of Games seems to do it with a similarly bare bones presentation somehow…) Chandler Groover December 6, 2024 at 10:23 pm >I do know that this year’s IF Comp winner was by Chandler Groover. I don’t think he’s our age. I discovered IF in 2014. It’s not retro to me. It’s contemporary! Eriorg December 7, 2024 at 8:19 pm Of course, in 2007 Inform 7 came out. Actually, it was in 2006 (on April 30). Jerzy December 8, 2024 at 3:48 am Jimmy, thank you for making and posting this interview. Fascinating stuff. Andrew, thanks for all your incredible work over the years! Do you still have a copy of the filesystem-based version of Praser 5? I love your description of it here, and I can imagine mocking up a (much simpler!) version to assign to my undergrad students. Many of them seem genuinely perplexed when I ask where they saved their files for an assignment — “it’s, like, in the cloud?!” — and maybe a praser-5-lite game could help motivate them to learn this stuff. Andrew Plotkin December 8, 2024 at 7:34 pm > Do you still have a copy of the filesystem-based version of Praser 5? I do, but wow, it’s really ancient. I mean it’s written in C, and not even ANSI C — it’s K&R style. I’m not sure it would be a great introduction to the filesystem. I was trying to *subvert* the idea of the filesystem by making it look more like a text adventure. Jerzy December 10, 2024 at 1:54 am That’s too bad but makes sense! I have a friend who likes to say “It subverts the genre to transcend the genre,” which is also a good description of many of your games, but perhaps not the best pedagogical approach for the filesystem newbies I have in mind :-) fform December 8, 2024 at 4:13 am Great interview. Regarding the discussion about AI at the end, while I can’t imagine “AI” (LLMs in this case) producing anything of interest, since it’s all just statistical prediction with no concept of what is actually being said, has anyone actually had an LLM AI play through a game? I’m curious now to know whether an LLM could statistically guess its’ way through a parser-based puzzle. stepped pyramids December 8, 2024 at 4:54 pm I’ve experimented both with using an LLM to solve a parser-based game and using it as a kind of “superparser” to translate natural language human input into commands. Both worked, but I don’t know how useful it is in practice (it’s kind of fun to translate “kiss my butt!” to “say insult to guard”, but I don’t know that it’s worth the latency).

Job growth bounced back after the hurricanes and strike impacted October data, but not enough to ... [+] relieve all worry about a softening labor market. The November jobs report on Friday was solid but had enough question marks to keep the door wide open to a Federal Reserve rate cut on December 18. Job growth bounced back after the hurricanes and strike impacted October data, but not enough to relieve all worry about a softening labor market. Any concerns about the short-term fate of the economy remain misplaced, as the Atlanta Fed currently estimates 3.3% GDP growth for the fourth quarter. Employment grew by 227,000 nonfarm jobs, which was above expectations. The October data was revised upward by 36,000. The household survey data was soft, with a loss of 355,000 jobs, but the research series, which mirrors the payroll report criteria, rose by 117,000. Monthly Job Growth Wages held steady at 4.0% year-over-year, above the expectations of 3.9%. The average workweek hours rose to 34.3, above the four-year low of 34.2 in January, July, and October. Hours Worked & Wages The high-frequency initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits confirm the reversal of the impact of the hurricanes and strike. However, both series are above early-year levels, indicating some softening in the employment outlook. Initial Jobless Claims The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%. Before the decline from the August unemployment rate highs, the rate had risen enough off the lows to signal an impending recession by the Sahm Rule. The Sahm Rule has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession, but there are several reasons to believe that it might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Notably, another slight move upward in the unemployment rate will push the Sahm Rule back onto forecasting an economic downturn. Sahm Rule: U.S. Recession Indicator Monitoring the prime-age, 25- to 54-year-old employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The two-month decline in the prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence of some labor market softening. It should be monitored closely, but it does not yet pose an imminent threat to the health of the economy. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio Stocks had another positive week, with the S&P 500 hitting all-time highs by Friday’s market close. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), moved sharply higher. Economically and regulatorily sensitive bank stocks have been robust since the U.S. Presidential election. Market Returns Stocks and other risk assets have been on the rise since election day. In addition to the resilient economy, the bullish story is bolstered by the fact that December is seasonally one of the top-returning months of the year. 3 Top Months For The S&P 500 Since 1950 Less helpful for the intermediate-term outlook for stocks is the more bullish than average investor sentiment. While not at extreme levels yet, it is at a place where we have seen pullbacks in the past. Investor Sentiment Looking below the surface, the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed defensive stocks, which are less impacted by the economy. This ratio remains elevated despite some of the cracks in the jobs report, which indicates that investors continue to price a low probability of recession risk in stocks. Cyclicals Versus Defensives A crucial economic report before the next Federal Reserve meeting on December 18 includes Wednesday’s consumer inflation (CPI) report. Consensus estimates expect November CPI to rise to 2.7% year-over-year from 2.6%. The Cleveland Fed’s CPI supports this view and should leave the door open to a 25 basis point cut at the December meeting. U.S. CPI Inflation Estimate Futures pricing reacted to the strong jobs report by raising the odds of 25 (0.25%) basis points at the December Fed meeting. Barring a surprise in economic data, investors should anticipate another rate cut at the meeting. Number Of Expected Rate Cuts While solid, the Friday job report had enough question marks to cause the Federal Reserve to want some insurance against the downside in the labor market and economy by cutting short-term rates at the upcoming December meeting. Wednesday’s consumer inflation (CPI) reading will be crucial in leaving the door open to the rate cut. Meanwhile, stocks and other risk assets continue to paint a rosy picture of the outlook for economic growth and corporate profits. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: Trump’s favourite index is tipped to rally further in 2025. But will he get in the way?

Donald Trump’s vetting of cabinet picks second time round may have thrown up some blunders, with his nominee to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) this week following the fate of Matt Gaetz’s short-lived candidacy for attorney general. Chad Chronister, currently a Florida sheriff, withdrew his name to run the DEA from consideration – though Trump says he pulled the plug – on Wednesday as a result of uproar among Republicans over his arrest of a pastor in 2020 for holding large services during a Covid lockdown. It follows Gaetz withdrawing his name for lawyer-in-chief last month amid allegations of sexual misconduct. However, the band Trump is putting together elsewhere – including hedge fund billionaire Scott Bessent being picked as treasury secretary, oil industry veteran Chris Wright as energy secretary, stockbroking firm Cantor Fitzgerald chief executive Howard Lutnick as commerce secretary, and Paul Atkins, a free marketeer and crypto-friendly lawyer, as head of the Securities and Exchange Commission – has been warmly received at a constituency close to his heart: Wall Street. The stock market, as we learned during Trump’s first term in office, is Trump’s favoured barometer of success – having regularly peppered speeches back then with the question, “How’s your 401(K) doing?” That referred to the stock-laden retirement savings vehicles used by more than 100 million Americans. New York’s S&P 500 index of blue-chip US companies, the world’s most widely followed equities index, has advanced almost 5.5 per cent since Trump outflanked Kamala Harris just over a month ago – bringing its advance so far this year to 28 per cent, and to an all-time high. Investors have committed almost $140 billion (€132.3 billion) of fresh money to US equity funds since the election, with November being the busiest month for inflows on records stretching back to 2000, on hopes the incoming administration will unleash sweeping tax cuts and reforms to help corporate America, the Financial Times reported on Friday, citing figures from market data provider EPFR. The S&P 500, which has a major influence on stock markets globally, is on track to reach 6,500 points by the end of next year, according to median forecast of 48 equity strategists recently polled by Reuters. That points to about a 7 per cent advance from current levels. Former Iseq heavyweights CRH and Flutter Entertainment have quit the Irish market in the past 15 months and moved their main listings to the US with an aim of ultimately joining the S&P 500. Smurfit Kappa secured direct entry to the index in July when it merged with a US cardboard box-making rival to form Smurfit Westrock. But never has the US market been dominated by so few. The so-called magnificent seven group of high-performing stocks – including Nvidia, the maker of powerful artificial intelligence (AI) computer chips, Microsoft, Tesla, Meta, Alphabet, Apple and Amazon – have driven the broader market higher in 2024. Nvidia’s 200 per cent surge alone has fuelled a fifth of the S&P 500’s gain this year. And the seven are seen leading the way again in 2025, according to strategists. There’s a lot of hope priced into equities right now. But investors don’t have to look too far to see red flags. Following this year’s rally, companies on the S&P 500 are trading at an average of 23 times expected earnings, according to stock market research firm Birinyi Associates. That’s well over the 10-year average of about 18. Tech valuations are even more stretched. Joe Davis, chief economist of Vanguard, the world’s second-largest manager, warned this week that the market had overestimated the short-term potential of AI technology, increasing the risk of a price “correction”. He said some tech valuations were approaching those of 1997 – referring to the tech bubble era. While JP Morgan strategists were upbeat on equities in their 2025 market outlook, published this week, as central banks continue to ease interest rates and the new US administration embarks on a programme of deregulation, they warned of a risk of “disruptive Trump policies triggering a crash landing”. Historically high prices for US housing, crypto currencies (Bitcoin breached $100,000 for the first time on Thursday) and gold, as well as low corporate bond market interest rates, relative to risk, broaden the potential fallout. The Central Bank of Ireland highlighted in a report this week that there is a “widening disconnect” between economic uncertainty – also stemming from the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East, and fears about a possible US-China clash over Taiwan – and current low volatility in global equity and debt markets. This increases the chances of a “sharp repricing of assets”, it warned. Trump 2.0, with a return of “America first”, has already seen the president-elect suggest universal tariffs on all goods imported to the US and sharply higher levies on Chinese goods. He has also threatened neighbouring Mexico and Canada with 25 per cent taxes on goods from both unless they stem immigration to the US and flows of drugs. Economists have said tariffs will be inflationary and force the US Federal Reserve to reverse course on its current cycle of easing interest rates. “The effects would be inflationary in the short term – with companies facing higher input costs and consumers paying more for finished goods; [and be] a drag on US GDP in the medium term, while underpinning still-high benchmark interest rates,” said S&P Global Ratings. GDP stands for gross domestic product. Inflation could also be stoked if mass deportations of illegal immigrants kick in – or people start self-deporting in droves – under Trump. Fewer workers in some industries could put upward pressure on wages. Stock market bulls argue Trump will be quick to change course on any economically disruptive policies if they lead to a stock market sell-off. But that won’t prevent volatility in the meantime. And incoming cabinet members should know from the experience of the walking wounded from Trump’s first administration, he’ll always find someone else to blame.
