Mark Zuckerberg (left), Jeff Bezos (center) and Elon Musk (right) at Donald Trump's inauguration in January, alongside Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Bezos' fiancée Lauren Sánchez. Editor's note: This article was updated after the stock market close at 4 pm Eastern time on April 3, 2025. P resident Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that the U.S. would impose a flat 10% tariff on every country in the world, with higher rates for many of America’s largest trading partners including China, India, Japan, South Korea, the U.K. and the European Union. The news sent stock markets tumbling around the world on Thursday, with the S&P 500 index down 5% and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite down 6%. Stock markets in Japan, Hong Kong and Europe also suffered losses. That rout wiped a collective $270 billion from the fortunes of the world’s 3,000 billionaires. The biggest losers so far are the very richest people in the world, particularly those who have cozied up to Trump in recent times. No one has been hit harder than Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, whose fortune is down by $17.9 billion since yesterday’s stock market close, as shares of the Facebook parent plummeted by 9%. Zuckerberg, who sat next to Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk at Trump’s inauguration in January after Meta donated to Trump’s inaugural committee, has also met with the president at the White House several times since then—most recently on Wednesday. The second-biggest loser so far? Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, who has recently tried to grow closer to Trump, sitting in the second row behind the president at his inauguration in January after Amazon donated to Trump’s inaugural committee. In February, he announced the Washington Post—which he bought for $250 million in 2013—would change its opinion pages to focus on supporting personal liberties and free markets. A month later, he opined on tariffs, saying in an X post that the opinion pages would cover "the damaging and distorting effects if tariffs are used to pick winners and losers." With Amazon shares down 9%, Bezos is $16 billion poorer on Thursday. Larry Ellison, the founder of software giant Oracle, is down $9.9 billion, thanks to a 6% drop in Oracle stock. (He’s also a major shareholder in Tesla.) Unlike Bezos and Zuckerberg, Ellison has long been a major donor to Republicans, and he hosted a fundraiser for Trump in 2020 and dined with him at his Palm Beach club Mar-A-Lago last year. In January, he joined the president to announce a planned $500 billion investment in AI data centers in the U.S. alongside OpenAI’s Sam Altman and Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son. Elon Musk, the world’s richest person and Trump’s right-hand-man at the Department of Government Efficiency, is taking a beating, too. He has lost $8.7 billion, the fifth-most in dollar terms among billionaires, with Tesla shares slumping by more than 5% after a rough week in which the automaker announced its sales dropped by 13% in the first three months of the year. Meanwhile, French luxury tycoon Bernard Arnault, who was the world’s richest person until last year, suffered an $8.6 billion loss as shares in his conglomerate LVMH dipped by nearly 6%. Arnault made a public display of support for Trump in January, attending his inauguration alongside two of his five children, who are all executives at LVMH. Besides Bezos and Zuckerberg, many other tech barons—including Michael Dell, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang and Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin—also saw steep losses. At least five billionaires have fallen out of the ranks entirely today. The biggest loser in percentage terms has been RH (formerly Restoration Hardware) CEO Gary Friedman, whose net worth has fallen by 37%, to about $730 million. Shares in the upscale furniture firm have plunged by 40%, wiping $435 million from Friedman’s fortune. Other dropoffs made their fortunes in the clothing industry, which could also be hard-hit by tariffs: The U.S. is the largest importer of apparel in the world, sourcing most apparel from Asia, including 21% from China and 18% from Vietnam. It’s no surprise then that husband-and-wife duo Kenneth and Yvonne Lo, the Hong Kong-based cofounders of clothing manufacturer Crystal International Group, also have fallen below the $1 billion mark as shares in the Hong Kong-based firm tumbled by 23%. Crystal, which makes clothes for companies including Gap, Abercrombie & Fitch, Nike, Adidas and Puma, relied on North America for 38% of its revenues in 2024. Brian Hill, the founder of Vancouver-based women's fashion retailer Aritzia, also saw his net worth fall below $1 billion as the firm's stock cratered by 20%. And how is Trump faring amid the market upheaval? Not so bad. The president’s net worth is down by $40 million, to $4.6 billion, as shareholders pushed the price of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., the parent company of his social media outfit Truth Social, down 3%, less than overall market’s decline. Here are the 10 biggest billionaire losers as of the market close:

April 03, 2025 14:15 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On March 27, 2025, investors in AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) saw the price of their shares drop $65.92, wiping out about $20 billion of the company’s market value, after prominent short seller Muddy Waters Research revealed its short position in the stock. Muddy Waters’ report comes on the heels of a recently filed securities class action lawsuit, captioned Quiero v. AppLovin Corporation, et al., No. 4:25-cv-02294 (N.D. Cal.). The suit seeks to represent investors who purchased AppLovin securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Hagens Berman is investigating the claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Recent Development: On March 27, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a scathing report titled “AppLovin: Deep Data Analysis Shows APP is Just Another Scammy AdTech Company.” The report’s focus is in part on “retargeting” (a strategy that aims to re-engage potential customers who have previously interacted with a brand), “incrementality” (the additional or incremental lift in sales or conversions that a marketing activity generates), and AppLovin’s compliance with third party platforms’ TOS (terms of service). Muddy Waters contends that “APP e-commerce is Mostly Retargeting, Incrementality is Low, and it Clearly Violates Platforms’ TOS.” Muddy Waters alleges that: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Securities Class Action: The Muddy Waters report follows the filing of a securities class action complaint alleging AppLovin made false and misleading statements, while failing to disclose critical details about its flagship AXON 2.0 digital advertising platform. The company had heavily promoted the platform as "the best and fastest-growing product we’ve ever released." Investors were allegedly led to believe that the platform, which reportedly leverages “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would redefine the digital advertising landscape by enhancing ad placement efficiency and expanding into e-commerce and web-based marketing. However, the alleged narrative first shifted on February 26, 2025, when short sellers Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research published damaging reports that raised pointed questions about the company’s claims. Both research firms accused AppLovin of misleading investors regarding the platform's true capabilities and ethical practices. Fuzzy Panda Research alleged that the company violated app store policies by exploiting user data in questionable ways, predicting that tech giants Apple and Google would ban AppLovin from their app stores. Additionally, they accused AppLovin of “stealing data from Meta” as part of its e-commerce initiatives, foreseeing swift retaliation from Meta. Culper Research criticized the company for allegedly using AXON 2.0 as little more than a promotional facade to obscure the real drivers behind its business strategy. Culper's report further claimed that AppLovin's growth in mobile gaming has relied on “systematic exploitation of app permissions that enable advertisements themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations onto users’ phones, with just a single click – an event that is often inadvertent thanks to the Company’s notorious UX gimmicks” and that “each illicit install translates directly to profit.” “We are investigating claims that AppLovin may have misled investors about whether its growth may be attributable to illegitimate conduct,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: Trump's Tariffs Are a Bruising Defeat for the AI Industry

Time Published: 2025-04-03T17:29:13Z

If you follow tech stocks, there's probably one thing on your mind today: Donald Trump's tariffs. Yesterday, Trump announced his long-teased "reciprocal tariffs" on foreign imports coming into the US. Among them are a 32 percent tariff on Taiwan, 24 percent on Japan, 26 percent on India, and 34 percent on China — all major players in the global tech trade. As a result, the magnificent seven (M7) stocks — a stock trader term for the current whales of the tech industry: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla — are in a freefall today, as investors sell off their shares to brace for economic uncertainty. Among the tech industry, the stagnant AI sector is being hit particularly hard, as energy costs are anticipated to skyrocket along with the cost of important resources like steel, precious minerals, and semiconductors. As such, the cost to build and run data centers, the massive facilities that make AI computing possible, is expected to spike as the supply chain adjusts to the new normal. The vast majority of chips that power these data centers come from hard-hit countries like Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, and Vietnam, while the US makes just 11 percent of its chips at home. Trump's tariffs will force countries from those companies to hike their chip prices, and US companies will no doubt hike their prices to compensate, which will ultimately run off to consumers. That's a crushing blow for American AI companies, which were already facing the consequences of investor skepticism, lagging revenue, and a disappointing debut AI IPO by CoreWeave. Broader details about how these tariffs will affect the tech industry are foggy right now, as the stock market is moving at a breakneck pace, but there is one common theme: everything is down. Apple, for example, is heading for its biggest single-day plunge in stock price in nearly 5 years, dropping over 8 percent in just the first few hours of trading. Other M7 stocks are likewise plummeting, with Amazon down almost 9 percent, and Nvidia down by 6.7 at the time of writing. Tesla has continued its months-long cascade with a 7 percent dip so far. If you're wondering why we're doing this, you're not alone. For decades, the United States has sat atop the global economic food chain. Thanks to years of military and economic supremacy, the US dollar became the world standard, making it easy to export cheap consumer goods as high-paying American jobs became starvation industries in countries dependent on US trade. Trump's tariffs seem to be an attempt to reverse all that — an economic experiment that's never really been attempted at this scale. The entire move hinges on the bet that companies will shift production from places like Vietnam and Taiwan back into the US, a gamble which business leaders say comes with high costs and even higher risks. As Trump's tariffs aren't enshrined in law, they could be easily undone by the courts or the next presidential administration, making a long-term investment into, say, a $5 billion semiconductor plant on US soil hard to justify from a business standpoint — and at the end of the day, isn't what this is all about?

Title: Trump Delusionally Brags About Tariffs as Stock Market Crashes

Time Published: 2025-04-03T16:01:35Z

In the topsy-turvy world of the Trump administration, market panic and financial suffering are somehow good things. The president unveiled his economic agenda on Wednesday, revealing steep tariff hikes on practically every country in the world—regardless of whether the U.S. is running a trade deficit or surplus there. The news sent markets reeling. But by Thursday morning, Donald Trump was still celebrating his plan. “THE OPERATION IS OVER! THE PATIENT LIVED, AND IS HEALING,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “THE PROGNOSIS IS THAT THE PATIENT WILL BE FAR STRONGER, BIGGER, BETTER, AND MORE RESILIENT THAN EVER BEFORE. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!” But it’s unclear what metrics—if any—Trump used to measure his success. In reality, American businesses were seriously disturbed. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged by 1,500 points, about 3.5 percent, while the S&P 500 sank by 3.9 percent, setting both on pace for their worst day since the 2022 inflation crisis. The Nasdaq Composite tanked by more than 5 percent—bringing it down by 17 percent from its all-time high and down 13 percent year-to-date, the index’s worst performance since March 2020. Stock futures similarly plummeted. The value of the U.S. dollar dropped, and the price for a troy ounce of gold skyrocketed. Overnight, some of the country’s most competitive companies lost hundreds of billions of dollars. Nike and Lululemon, whose business models rely on international manufacturing deals in China and Vietnam, each lost more than 10 percent. Big-box stores also saw prominent losses: Best Buy, Target, and Home Depot lost 5 percent. The tech industry was similarly shaken: Apple was down 9 percent (worth approximately $300 billion in market value), Alphabet by 4 percent, Amazon by 7 percent, Meta by 7 percent, Microsoft by 3 percent, and Nvidia by 6 percent. Stores that rely heavily on imported goods saw their stocks tank too. Five Below lost 29 percent, Dollar Tree fell by 8 percent, and the Gap suffered a 22 percent loss. “The macro does not make sense, but the level of chaos and uncertainty, coupled with revaluing highly overpriced stocks, is hitting hard,” assessed CNBC analyst Ron Insana on Thursday. In a note to investors, JP Morgan said that Trump’s tariffs had a 40 percent chance of slingshotting the U.S. economy into a recession. JP Morgan underscored that the tariffs would cause a price surge—adding 2 percent to the consumer price index—and additionally raise taxes on Americans by $660 billion a year, “the largest tax increase in recent memory by a long shot,” reported CNN. “The impact on inflation will be substantial,” the analysts said, according to CNN. “We view the full implementation of these policies as a substantial macroeconomic shock.” A judge has ordered the Trump administration to release a man whom it wrongly detained and planned to deport to El Salvador. In a brief one-page filing overnight Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Rolando Olvera ordered that the government not only release Adrian Gil Rojas but that it buy him a ticket from Brownsville, Texas, back to New York. “The Court holds that the Petitioner is a Venezuelan national with a valid Temporary Protected Status and was wrongfully detained,” Olvera wrote. “The Court further holds that Respondents produced no evidence that Petitioner is a danger to the public,” he added. The government had argued that it should be allowed to detain and deport Gil Rojas because his TPS was set to expire on April 2, but his lawyer insisted that he was in the process of reopening his immigration case and that there was reason to believe that the Trump administration’s efforts to repeal TPS would fail. The lawyer was right: On Monday, a San Francisco judge blocked the government from revoking the protected status of about 350,000 Venezuelans. Judge Edward Chen slammed Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem for making “sweeping negative generalizations about Venezuelan TPS beneficiaries.” “Acting on the basis of a negative group stereotype and generalizing such stereotype to the entire group is the classic example of racism,” Chen said in his order. Gil Rojas, who said that he was arrested in New York last month, had been one of dozens of Venezuelan nationals detained by ICE who were sneakily moved closer and closer to an airfield in Harlingen, Texas, where the government staged a mass deportation to a notorious torture prison in El Salvador. On March 14, the plane that was supposed to take Gil Rojas suffered a mechanical issue and was rescheduled for the following day, giving his lawyer enough time to get Olvera to issue an order blocking his immediate removal. Gil Rojas was spared, unlike the dozens of others for whom due process was suspended under Donald Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime law he has reappropriated to aid in his mass deportation efforts. Olvera said that when Gil Rojas was returned to New York, he should be released on his own recognizance, and recommended that he wear an ankle monitor while his immigration case was pending. Earlier this week, the Trump administration admitted that it had wrongly deported Kilmer Armado Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national who had been granted protected status from being sent back to El Salvador. The government blamed an “administrative error,” and a judge ruled that the man could not be returned to the U.S. because the court lacked jurisdiction now that he was out of U.S. custody. Evidence that the government expedited the deportation of individuals who, as Olvera put it, were not a “danger to the public” only continues to mount. The government revealed that it had heavily relied on the tattoos to identify members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang the U.S. government has deemed a terrorist group, for deportation. But experts on the gang say that there are no tattoos that signify TdA affiliation. When Democrats attacked the Trump administration for the gargantuan price of eggs, the administration responded by importing vast quantities from Turkey and South Korea—two countries that were hit hard by the tariffs imposed on Wednesday. When asked about the issue, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins had no definitive answer on whether those imported eggs would be tariffed, reinforcing the multiple contradictions at the center of Trump’s isolationist trade war in the process. “President Trump yesterday gave you much praise talking about the job you’ve done in the last month and a half. I wanna talk about what you’ve done with eggs,” Fox Business’s Maria Bartiromo asked Rollins on Thursday. “National egg prices have declined 9 percent from last week, now averaging $3 a dozen, according to the USDA. Secretary … are eggs gonna be tariffed?” “Well, so, yeah let’s pivot to eggs.… Listen, we rolled out a very bold plan about a month ago.… Obviously it’s his vision we’re effectuating. The market reacted very favorably to it, [it] included some short-term imports but also included helping our poultry farmers in America,” Rollins answered, avoiding the question. “So as we repopulate our chicken farms and our egg-laying farms, I think we’ll see the price coming down even more.… Only good news on the egg front, and hopefully it will hold.” "Yes, I mean, all to be determined, we're all in negotiations, but yes, that's a possibility" -- Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins can't definitively answer a question about whether imported eggs are being tariffed pic.twitter.com/DeQf55p14J “So where are the eggs coming from that you’re importing?” Bartiromo asked. “Well, we’re importing from Turkey, we’re importing from South Korea, to a few other countries right now,” Rollins responded. “But again, at the end of the day. once our farms are repopulated … then we’ll go back to pretty much using all American-lain eggs.” “So then that means that eggs will be tariffed, if you’re taking them from Turkey, right? That’s part of the tariff plan,” Bartiromo pushed. There will be a 10 percent tariff on Turkey, according to Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement. “Well, yes, all to be determined,” Rollins replied, refusing to commit. ‘We’re all at negotiations, but yes, that’s a possibility.” Lower grocery prices—and lower prices in general—were a central theme of Trump’s campaign. Trump himself riffed on it at his “Liberation Day” announcement. But the new tariffs go directly against those promises, and even his inner circle are struggling to find a way to explain themselves. Got a problem with the Trump administration? Good luck. Recently laid-off employees from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services were told to contact Anita Pinder, the former director at the agency’s Office of Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights, with any complaints. A notice informed severed workers that they had 45 calendar days to contact Pinder following their termination date, listing Pinder’s name, email, and phone number. But those who knew Pinder said the directive came as a “gut punch,” according to The Washington Post, since Pinder died last year. “They couldn’t have run it past the people at CMS that were at the funeral and knew she died,” Karen Shields, one of Pinder’s former co-workers, told the Post. “This is a lack of communication. There is just a better way to do this.” Shields told the newspaper that it “pained” her to see Pinder’s name used in the reduction-in-force notices. “She would have been someone, even though her job would have been on the chopping block, she would have helped,” Shields said. The negligent error is just one recent instance in which the “shock and awe” of the Trump administration’s federal makeover has resulted in dud details and mass confusion. At the Food and Drug Administration, fired staffers were instructed to contact an Office of Equal Employment Opportunity employee that had left the agency more than a month ago, the Post reported. So far, the Trump administration—directed by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency—has fired more than 100,000 federal employees. But tens of thousands more government jobs are expected to be on the chopping block as Trump pursues a second round of “voluntary” buyouts. More than 10,000 jobs are expected to be cut at the Department of Health and Human Services, which encompasses the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed downsizing the agency’s 82,000-person workforce by nearly a quarter. A new Gallup poll shows that Americans are much more worried about Social Security and the economy. The poll, which measured opinions from March 3 to March 16, said that concern about the Social Security system is at a 15-year high, with 52 percent of Americans worried about it a “great deal.” Also ranking high were the economy at 60 percent, health care costs at 59 percent, and inflation at 56 percent. The worries reflect the Trump administration’s actions over the past few months, with cuts made to the Social Security Administration and the whiplash over the president’s bizarre tariff decisions. Those fears may get worse, as Trump went ahead with instituting aggressive tariffs against countries across the world on Wednesday, calling it “Liberation Day.” Meanwhile, Elon Musk, who is overseeing much of the administration’s policy, has called Social Security “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.” Markets have already plummeted Thursday, and criticism of the tariffs have even come within the Republican Party. Cuts to the Social Security Administration threaten to cause interruptions to benefits for 73 million retired workers, their survivors, and poor and disabled Americans. Last month, Martin O’Malley, who headed the SSA under President Biden, warned that the cuts could result in the agency missing payments for the first time in its 80-year history. It’s no surprise that the last time worries about Social Security were this high, the country was in the midst of a recession brought about by the financial crisis of 2008. The difference between now and then is that these worries are brought about by self-inflicted crises. Neither the SSA or the economy were in trouble prior to Trump’s inauguration. If the president continues on its current course, these worries could evolve into full-blown panic over losing Social Security and an even worse recession. The Trump administration is urging nervous voters to “trust” it in response to the impending economic fallout from the President’s tariffs on virtually all foreign imports. “To anyone on Wall Street this morning I would say trust in President Trump,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on CNN Thursday morning. “This is a president who is doubling down on his proven economic formula from his first time. We saw a wages increase, we saw inflation come down. We had a Trump energy boom, we had the largest tax cuts in history, and that’s exactly what the president intends to do.… The United States of America is no longer going to be cheated by foreign nations around the world.” The trade war that the president announced on Wednesday as “Liberation Day” has already tanked the stock market. The country is lurching into a recession, and there is little indication that things will improve anytime soon. Indeed, the tariffs announced on Wednesday are little more than a spiteful policy intended to stick it to friend and foe alike, ostensibly for the purpose of reinvigorating American manufacturing. This is virtually impossible, as these aggressive reciprocal tariffs will most certainly drive up prices for manufacturers and consumers across the country. But the administration would rather have you believe that the economic impact won’t be that bad, or even noticeable. “What can you tell the American people that—they just can’t afford an extra $3 here and there—about the government making up the difference from them?” Lawrence Jones asked Vice President JD Vance on Thursday morning. “Will costs go up at some point, will this just be temporary? Are we talkin’ three months or six months?” “We know a lot of Americans are worried. So we are working very hard to bring prices down,” Vance said. “What I ask folks to appreciate here is that we are not gonna fix things overnight.… We know people are struggling, we’re fighting as quickly as we can to fix what was left to us. But it’s not gonna happen immediately. But we really do believe that if we pursue the right deregulation, we pursue those energy cost-reducing policies, yes people are gonna see it in their pocketbook, they’re also gonna benefit from the fact that foreign countries can’t take advantage of us anymore, that means their jobs are gonna be more secure.” Neither Vance nor Leavitt actually explain how actions like hitting China with a 34 percent tariff will bring prices down for the everyday American, or how this country will be a self-sufficient producer in just a few years. This backtracking and gaslighting is a far cry from Trump’s promise to “immediately bring prices down, starting on day one.” In the scores of countries hit by Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs announced Wednesday, one was mysteriously—but not surprisingly—absent: Russia. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Axios Wednesday that Moscow had been spared from Trump’s tariffs because U.S. sanctions already “preclude any meaningful trade.” Similarly, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News that it wasn’t necessary to place tariffs on Russia because after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, trade between the U.S. and Russia had effectively dried up. But the claim that the U.S. doesn’t trade with Russia isn’t remotely true. In 2024, the U.S. imported $3 billion worth of goods from Russia, which was down from $4.6 billion the year before. While this number may be small in comparison to key trading partners such as Canada, which imported a whopping $412.7 billion worth of American goods in 2024, it is still significantly more trade than with other countries that Trump levied steep tariffs against. For example, Saint Pierre et Miquelon, a small French island territory off the coast of Canada, was hit with a whopping 50 percent tariff on imports to the U.S. The island, which has a population of roughly 5,000 people, imported only $100,000 worth of U.S. goods in 2024 and exported roughly $3.4 million worth of goods back. If that’s not low enough, Trump even listed several uninhabited islands as receiving a 10 percent tariff on imports to the United States: Heard Island and the McDonald Islands, an Australian territory that is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site for its “complete absence of alien plants and animals, as well as human impact.” Clearly, a lack of trade was not an actual consideration in the Trump administration’s decision to levy tariffs, though Leavitt claimed that existing sanctions were also why Cuba, Belarus, and North Korea were not included on the list. With Leavitt’s excuse falling flat, it seems increasingly likely that Trump has attempted to carve out a back door for Russian President Vladimir Putin to continue to do business with the U.S. as it makes an economic enemy out of every other country in the world. Canada and Mexico were also absent from the list because Trump had already hit them with 25 percent tariffs on all U.S. imports, according to Leavitt. The Trump administration seems to have destroyed global economies overnight while misunderstanding basic economics. In the wake of Donald Trump’s tariff announcement Wednesday, former New Yorker financial writer James Surowiecki pointed out that a column on Trump’s tariff sheet labeled “tariffs charged to the U.S.A.” was likely founded on bad math. “They didn’t actually calculate tariff rates + non-tariff barriers, as they say they did. Instead, for every country, they just took our trade deficit with that country and divided it by the country’s exports to us,” Surowiecki argued. “So we have a $17.9 billion trade deficit with Indonesia. Its exports to us are $28 billion. $17.9/$28 = 64 percent, which Trump claims is the tariff rate Indonesia charges us.” “What extraordinary nonsense this is,” he added. That would mean that the Trump administration imposed earth-shattering tariff hikes on the rest of the world without looking at the whole picture. Mainly, that the administration calculated the tariffs charged by other countries by only looking at goods provided, rather than the combined value of goods and services—something that “most economists seem to think is an odd way to calculate tariffs,” according to BBC Verify’s Shayan Sardarizadeh. The White House initially refuted the tariff theory. White House Deputy Press Secretary Kush Desai posted on X that “we literally calculated tariff and non tariff barriers.” But in an attempt to prove his point, Desai grabbed a formula from the US Treasury website that actually proved Surowiecki’s. Sardarizadeh broke it down. “∆τᵢ = (x-m) / (ε x φ x m),” he shared. “The formula includes ‘x’ for exports and ‘m’ for imports.” “But it also has ‘ε’ for ‘price elasticity of import demand’, set at 4 by the Treasury; multiplied by ‘φ’ for ‘elasticity of import prices’, set at 0.25 by the Treasury, which means they basically cancel out each other as 4 x 0.25 = 1,” Sardarizadeh continued. “So, in effect, all you’re left with in the formula is exports - imports / imports, which is what X users and journalists had accurately pointed out all along.” But the administration’s bad math only matters so much to the tariff-heavy agenda. Even in countries where the trade deficit was less than 10 percent, or even in countries where there was a surplus, Trump still tacked on a 10 percent tariff. Donald Trump announced a range of tariffs on nearly every country in the world—including, inexplicably, some practically uninhabited islands, one of which is home to a U.S. military base. The British Indian Ocean Territory, a small cluster of islands in the South Indian Ocean, was hit with 10 percent tariffs on U.S. imports from the Trump administration Wednesday as part of its Liberation Day announcement. The islands are mostly uninhabited, save for approximately 3,000 U.S. and U.K. military personnel who are stationed at a joint Navy Support Facility on the island Diego Garcia. Trump’s tariffs would mostly affect the service members there. Another roughly 1,200 people live on the country’s Chagos Archipelago. As one might expect from the name, the territory is owned by the United Kingdom, which Trump hit with a 10 percent tariff, relatively low compared to other countries. Trump also announced 10 percent tariffs on the Heard Island and McDonald Islands, an uninhabited Australian territory that was listed as a Unesco World Heritage site for its “complete absence of alien plants and animals, as well as human impact.” Australia was saddled with a 10 percent tariff, as well. It’s unclear whether the tariffs on these territories would compound to 20 percent. Crucially, it’s unclear that anyone thought about this at all. Online, some speculated that the tariffs were doled out according to internet domains, and that because the Heart Island and McDonald Islands use a different domain (.hm) than Australia, (.au) they were considered different countries. That seemed to be the only explanation for levying a tariff on a territory that has no economy to speak of. Donald Trump claimed Wednesday that the United States entered the Great Depression as a result of turning its back on the policy of placing tariffs on other countries in favor of an income tax. During a winding speech to mark the so-called Liberation Day, Trump presented an alternative history where steep tariffs, like the ones he’d come to celebrate, could have prevented the worldwide economic disintegration of the early twentieth century. “From 1789 to 1913 we were a tariff-backed nation, and the United States was proportionately the wealthiest it has ever been,” Trump said, adding that the U.S. was “collecting so much money, so fast, we didn’t know what to do with it! “Then, in 1913 for reasons unknown to mankind, they established the income tax so citizens, rather than foreign countries, would start paying the money necessary to run our government,” he said. “Then in 1928 it all came to a very abrupt end with the Great Depression, and it would have never happened if they had stayed with the tariff policy; it would have been a much different story,” Trump said. “They tried to bring back tariffs to save our country, but it was gone. It was gone. It was too late, nothing could have been done.” Trump’s revisionist history is designed to promote his economic agenda—not reflect what actually happened. Not only could tariffs not have prevented the Great Depression, they made it even worse. In 1913, as the result of struggling farmers and Democrats advocating to establish an income tax, Republicans put up an income tax amendment, hoping that it would be rejected—it wasn’t, and the Sixteenth Amendment became law. At the same time, Congress passed the Underwood Simmons Tariff Act that lowered tariff rates from 40 percent to 27 percent, in a Democrat-backed effort to promote free trade. Crucially, tariffs were raised again in 1921, after Republican President Warren Harding entered the White House and began a reinvigorated era of protectionism. In 1930, Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which raised tariffs in all sectors and is considered to have exacerbated the worldwide economic downturn that lasted from 1929 until 1939, by undermining international trade and affording little protection to domestic producers. Smoot-Hawley was disastrous not only for the U.S. economy, tanking U.S. exports to Europe from $2,341 million in 1929 to just $784 million in 1932, but also for global trade, which declined by a whopping 66 percent between 1929 and 1934, according to the U.S. Office of the Historian. The effects of Smoot-Hawley were so awful that it marked the end of steep tariffs in American trade policy for the rest of the twentieth century. Trump’s baseless insistence that lowered tariffs led to the Great Depression is representative of his entire economic policy, and just how untethered from reality it has become.

Amazon and Meta shares are down about 7 percent. by Todd Haselton Shares of Apple, Amazon, and other tech stocks are getting walloped on Thursday as the markets digest the impact of President Donald Trump’s new round of tariffs announced on Wednesday evening. Shares of Apple were down about 9 percent on Thursday morning, which would mark the biggest drop in about five years if it holds until the close, according to CNBC. Amazon shares dropped about 7 percent. Both companies rely heavily on imports from other countries, like China, on which Trump plans to impose a 54 percent tariff beginning April 9th. Apple also manufactures some products in countries like Vietnam, on which a 46 percent tariff was announced. The tariffs, if they aren’t walked back, could mean increased prices on electronics for consumers or slimmer margins for companies like Apple and Amazon if they choose to eat some of the costs. Apple has typically had a gross margin, the amount of cash it gets to keep after it sells stuff, of around 38 percent, though it has been higher. Wall Street is likely concerned about lower demand if Apple has to increase the price of Macs, iPhones, iPads, and other products. Other big tech companies were impacted as well. Shares of Nvidia were down more than 4 percent on Thursday morning while Tesla stock was also down about 4 percent, giving up most of its Wednesday gains. Shares of Meta are down about 7 percent.

Title: Apple leads Magnificent 7 stock drop amid Trump tariffs

Apple (AAPL-6.90%) shares were down by 8.3% during afternoon trading on Thursday, leading the decline of Magnificent 7 stocks after President Donald Trump announced “reciprocal tariffs” following the market close on Wednesday. At mid-day on Thursday, Amazon was down by 7.2%, Nvidia was down by 6.2%, Meta was down by 5.8%, Tesla was down by 4.3%, Alphabet was down by 3.1%, and Microsoft was down by 1.4%. During pre-market trading, Apple had been down by 8.2%, while Amazon (AMZN-2.70%) was down by 6.7%, Meta (META-4.44%) was down by 6.6%, Nvidia (NVDA-7.40%) was down by 6.2%, Tesla (TSLA-9.99%) was down by 6.2%, Alphabet (GOOGL-2.26%) was down by 3.8%, and Microsoft (MSFT-3.09%) was down by 1.9%. Meanwhile, S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures all pointed to a lower opening on Thursday morning. The Trump administration’s tariffs are being applied on a country-by-country basis, and are calculated by combining the rate of tariffs, non-monetary barriers, “and other forms of cheating.” Trump said the U.S. will charge other countries “approximately half” of their charges. “April, 2, 2025 will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America’s destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again,” Trump said on Wednesday, adding that his tariffs are the “declaration of economic independence.” Baseline 10% tariffs are expected to go into effect on Saturday at 12:01 a.m. ET, while reciprocal levies are set to be effective on April 9 at 12:01 a.m. ET. Jefferies (JEF-9.97%) analysts said in a note on Thursday that the Trump administration’s 54% tariffs on China and 26% tariffs on India “caused a selloff on the Apple supply chain.” The analysts said it is currently unclear if Apple will be exempted from the tariffs as it was during Trump’s first administration in 2018, and that the company’s plan to invest $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years could “help it get exemption.” “The simple thought is likely that Apple’s products will be subject to this tariff, and thus demand will get hit and thus the supply chain will suffer,” Jefferies analysts said. “[I]n the worst case,” the analysts estimated that if Apple’s iPhone imports are subject to the 54% tariff on China and the company absorbs the cost to avoid a negative impact on sales volume, its full year net profit could be reduced by 14%. “It is possible for AAPL to raise price and pass on some tariff burden to high-end consumers without affecting volume too much (upside to our forecast), but that may be offset by the fact that some non-iPhone products would also create additional [negative] impact on AAPL’s earnings,” Jefferies analysts said. However, the analysts said that even if Apple is exempted from the reciprocal tariffs, “it will need to accelerate its supply chain diversification efforts, and thus needs to pay its suppliers better and give more share to those who could help AAPL achieve this objective.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Will Trump's New Tariffs Drive Up Headset Prices In The US?

With a 54% tariff set to apply to Chinese-made goods and 46% for Vietnam, will the price of VR headsets in the US soon increase? Enacted by President Trump via executive order yesterday, the new import tariffs are set to take effect from April 9, next Wednesday. They apply to goods manufactured in these countries, not just sold by companies from them. And while there are some exemptions, VR headsets aren't on that list. Most headsets today, including Apple Vision Pro, Meta Quest, PlayStation VR2, and Pico, are made in either China, Vietnam, or both. While Trump had already placed a 20% tariff on Chinese imports in recent months, headset companies could plausibly absorb these added costs, and he hadn't yet applied a tariff to electronics made in Vietnam. But with tariffs moving to 54% and 46% for China and Vietnam respectively, it seems very unlikely that most headset companies will be able to avoid increasing prices. For example, analyst estimates placed the cost to Meta of each Quest 3 at around $430, excluding R&D and other indirect costs, and thus the new tariffs should bring this to around $650, significantly higher than its current $500 price. Could we soon see a $700 Quest 3, $500 Quest 3S, and PlayStation VR2 move back to $550? Even the US-assembled Bigscreen Beyond 2 would feel the heat from the tariffs. Most of its components, such as its expensive micro-OLED displays from China, would be affected. And this cost would almost certainly need to be passed on to the buyer. Meta has been moving around half of Quest production to Vietnam, to avoid the tariffs Trump was expected to place on China. But with Vietnam hit too, this diversification won't make a major difference. Not every company will necessarily need to increase prices, though. The same analyst estimates place the cost to Apple of each Vision Pro at around $1700, also excluding R&D and other indirect costs, and thus Apple could still be making an acceptable profit even if the cost soon rises to around $2500. Consumer hardware companies typically build up large stock pools in each country they sell in, so we're not expecting to see Quest and PS VR2 prices suddenly jump next week. But eventually the US stock of these headsets will run out. And when new units are coming in at around 50% higher cost, how could the current US prices hold? Of course, it's possible that President Trump scales back or cancels these tariffs entirely by then. Trump's administration has described tariffs as a mechanism of putting pressure on countries to make certain policy changes, and perhaps the US president decides his aims have been satisfied before US headset stockpiles run out. The rapidly shifting global political landscape makes definitive predictions here impossible, so we'll be keeping a close eye on the situation over the coming weeks and months.

Title: How and where Trump's new tariffs affect Apple

AAPL: 188.51 ( 14.68 ) Copyright © 2025 Quiller Media, Inc. All rights reserved. Donald Trump's signed tariff plan - Photo credit CNBC Last updated 1 day ago President Trump's new tariffs go far beyond China, and hit every nation in the world. Here's how badly Apple has been hit, and where it has been struck globally. In February 2025, the Bank of America said that the impact of tariffs on Apple would be significant. Before the extent of the tariffs were announced, Bank of America estimated that they would mean Apple may have to raise iPhone prices by 10%. Apple has yet to make any announcements about price changes. It might have attempted to swallow small increases in component costs, but it is unlikely to absorb these massive ones. The company has previously made a point of how it has kept the iPhone costs the same for years — although only in the US. That means it has borne at least some inflation costs mostly because of smart buys of commodities like DRAM and NAND, and also any added expense of new technologies being added to the iPhone. But those costs will continue to rise anyway, and the addition of tariffs may mean even Apple cannot avoid raising its prices. Previously Apple was able to negotiate a tariff exemption during President Trump's first term, but as yet it has failed to do so again. So at present, Apple will have to pay the tariffs on everything it imports into the US. And, there is some double-dipping involved, perhaps. An iPad assembled in Vietnam will also incur a cost for having a processor manufactured in Taiwan. It should be clear that a TSMC processor made in Arizona would face no tariff, but materials imported to make those chips will be impacted. And, for now, it appears those chips are completed in TSMC's facilities in Taiwan, at least until the AMKOR finishing plant comes completely on line. Taking each country's tariffs separately, though, this is what CNBC says Apple now has to pay for devices or components from each of its biggest supply regions. ChinaChina currently accounts for: 80% of Apple's whole production capacity Assembly of 90% of all iPhones Assembly of 55% of Macs Assembly of 80% of iPads Overall, it's estimated that around 40% of all of Apple's suppliers are based in China. Tariffs that Apple will have to pay to import goods from these suppliers are immediately set to 34%. IndiaCurrently India assembles approximately 10% to 15% of iPhones, but has been expected to reach up to 20% by the end of 2025, helped by the country cutting import taxes for Apple and others. Apple is now required to pay a tariff of 26% on imports from India. VietnamVietnam has benefited from an increase in investment from Apple, partly to avoid the expected tariffs, and partly to avoid overall US/China trade tensions. It has also been intended to reduce Apple's over-dependence on China as a single supply source. Now, however, Apple will have to pay an import tariff of 46%. This will affect: Assembly of 20% of iPads Assembly of 90% of Apple Watch Other major countriesApple produces some Macs in Thailand, which now has a 36% tariff. Malaysia also manufacturers the Mac, and is facing a 25% tariff. The vast majority of processors in all Apple devices, though, are manufactured by Taiwan's TSMC. And imports to the US from Taiwan now have a 32% tariff. The impact on Apple, and market sentimentAnalysts are starting to chime in on what they expect to see from these tariffs. Krish Sankar from TD Cowen believes that US sales account for about 31% of total revenues with about 75% coming from hardware products. He estimates that every 10% of tariffs would impact Apple's net income by about 3.5% in FY25 and FY26 EPS. He also estimates that Apple will raise prices to offset tariffs, and estimates that every 10% of tariffs levied can be offset by an about 6% increase in product average selling price. Samik Chatterjee from JP Morgan has also come up with the 6% figure. Analyst Daniel Ives from Wedbush calls the tariff plan "illogical," and "economic Armageddon" for the global economy, and specifically, the American consumer. Ives reiterates that when other countries are hit with tariffs, it's ultimately the American consumer that bears the entire brunt of the bill. He still considers Apple a focus to own in a stock portfolio, but is expecting to see at least in the short term a 10% hit. Trump's new tariffs immediately caused stocks in technology firms to fall. Apple saw the largest drop of any technology firm. Apple's stocks fell almost 7.5% in extended trading as of 8 AM Eastern Time on April 3. It's not clear what the market sentiment will be when the market opens. In comparison, Nvidia's shares dropped 4%, while Tesla lost approximately 4.5%. Amazon, Meta, and Google parent company Alphabet all lost between 2.5% and 5%, while Microsoft is down almost 2%. Unless Apple stocks rebound during regular trading, this fall is the company's worst since September 2020. That was when the iPhone 12 launch was delayed because of COVID disruption.

President Trump has pushed back TikTok's ban date again, saying that his administration has made "tremendous progress" on a deal to "save TikTok." Apple's iconic iPhone may soon cost you about double what it costs now, as analysts predict a 43% price increase in response to U.S. tariffs on imports from China and elsewhere in the world. Investment bank Morgan Stanley has told investors that while Apple may have brought forward some iPhone 16 production ahead of Trump's new tariffs, there is little more it can do to mitigate a $33 billion cost increase it is about to incur. One of Apple's most controversial stores never opened, but a virtual tour that can be viewed on Apple Vision Pro brings the dream back to life. President Trump's announcement of tariffs and retaliatory measures by China has seen Apple's shares drop to their lowest point since June 2024, as investors predict rising iPhone prices and falling sales.

CarPlay in the newly updated iOS 18.4 is causing problems for an unknown number of users, who report it disconnecting and reconnecting. Apple and Michigan State University are opening a free manufacturing training academy in Detroit to help U.S. suppliers modernize their operations. Ming-Chi Kuo's Apple commentary is normally fairly insightful, but his latest batch on how Apple can shoulder President Trump's tariff burden is short-sighted, and doesn't make a great deal of sense.

Title: The Biggest Billionaire Gainers 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/roycanivel/2025/04/03/the-biggest-billionaire-gainers-2025/
Time Published: 2025-04-03T10:30:00Z

ByRoy Canivel ByRoy Canivel, Forbes Staff. The past 12 months have been very good to the planet’s billionaires. There are more of them (3,028) than ever before and they’re richer than they’ve ever been (worth a combined $16.1 trillion). Overall, the billionaire class is nearly $2 trillion richer than last year. But the big gains have not been shared evenly: $453 billion of the increase comes just from ten super fortunate people. These ten biggest gainers on Forbes’ 2025 World’s Billionaires list each added tens of billions—or, in one case, more than $100 billion—to their already-massive fortunes since the 2024 ranking. They made their money in retail, finance and, mainly, tech. No one in the world gained more than Elon Musk, who took back the title of richest person in the world after a stellar year for his startups SpaceX and xAI, plus a 12-month rise in the share price of Tesla, despite a recent selloff. Musk is an astonishing $147 billion richer this year. He’s the only billionaire to add nine figures to his net worth since the 2024 list. Eight of the ten are American citizens, either through birth or, in the case of Musk, naturalization. The other two are Lei Jun, a Chinese citizen whose fortune grew by 300%, to an estimated $43.5 billion, thanks to higher demand for his company’s electric cars, and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, a Canadian citizen worth an estimated $62.9 billion amid a jump in crypto markets. Tim Pannell for Forbes The only daughter of Walmart founder Sam Walton (d. 1992), she became the world’s richest woman in September, her first time since 2022. She hit the $100 billion mark in November as Walmart shares climbed to record highs. The stock is up more than 53% since last year. Best known for spearheading the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in her family’s hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas, Walton has given away an estimated $1.7 billion, including her most recent gift, disclosed in an August filing, of $249 million to help fund the new Alice L. Walton School of Medicine, also in Bentonville. Changpeng Zhao, who goes by CZ, is the founder and former CEO of Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. In November 2023, Zhao stepped down as Binance's CEO as part of a sweeping settlement with U.S. authorities. He pleaded guilty to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and was sentenced to four months in prison. He also paid a $50 million fine. He’s richer this year amid bull crypto markets and a Forbes investigation into his vast holdings of Binance’s exchange-issued token, BNB. Despite demands from the Justice Department to break up Google, the Alphabet cofounder and board member is $30 billion richer thanks to a 30% rise in the Google parent company’s shares. Page, who stepped down as Alphabet CEO in 2019, is reportedly working on a new company that plans to apply AI to manufacturing. The youngest son of Walmart founder Sam Walton (d. 1992), he retired from Walmart’s board in 2016 and yielded the seat to his son Steuart. He remains the chairman of the family's Arvest Bank Group, which boasts assets of $26 billion. The cofounder of Susquehanna International Group, one of Wall Street's largest and most successful trading firms, has invested in hundreds of private companies globally, including TikTok parent ByteDance, its most valuable holding based on Forbes reporting. He’s benefitted as ByteDance’s valuation has hit $312 billion in private markets amid a bidding war over TikTok. In September, he became the first member of America’s richest family to join the $100 billion club, on the back of rising Walmart shares. The eldest son of Sam Walton (d. 1992), he retired from the board in June 2024, after more than four decades as a director. Visual China Group via Getty Images From budget-friendly smartphones to electric vehicles, Xiaomi has come a long way since Lei Jun cofounded the Hong Kong-listed company in 2010. With the firm’s electric vehicle venture seeing higher demand for its cars, shares have climbed more than 300%. Last year, Lei was worth an estimated $10.9 billion. He is also the chairman of Hong Kong-listed software firm Kingsoft and an investor in JOYY Inc., a Nasdaq-listed live-streaming and social media platform formerly known as YY.com. Not long ago, Mark Zuckerberg banned President Donald Trump from Facebook and Instagram following the January 6 riots. One presidential election later, the Meta founder has friended Trump, including putting pro-Trump entrepreneur Dana White on Meta’s board in early January and cohosting an inauguration reception for the president alongside several Republican billionaires. Shares of his social media giant have surged nearly 25% since last year’s list, making Zuck the second richest person in the world for the first time. Ellison, too, has been sticking close to Trump. He may not have been front and center among tech tycoons during the president’s inauguration, but he stood a few feet away from Trump when the president soon announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative backed, in part, by Ellison’s software firm Oracle. Ellison’s net worth went up by $51 billion this year thanks to a growing AI business that helped push Oracle’s stock price up by 40%. AFP via Getty Images Thanks to an incredible $147 billion year, Elon Musk, yet again, is the richest person alive. All of his largest assets have gone up in value: Tesla stock is up 50% since last year’s list, rocket maker SpaceX is worth $350 billion, nearly double its valuation from last year, and Musk’s artificial intelligence business, xAI, raised $6 billion from private investors at a $50 billion valuation in November—then, last week, Musk announced that xAI was acquiring X (formerly Twitter) in an all-stock deal that valued X at more than what Musk paid in 2022, and boosted xAI’s valuation to an apparent $80 billion–a $30 billion bump from just three months ago.

U.S. futures indexes fell sharply early on Thursday, led by a deep slide in major tech stocks, while global markets also faced a major selloff after President Donald Trump’s sweeping reciprocal tariffs raised fears of a global trade war and recession. Apple CEO Tim Cook (C) seen behind US President Donald Trump (R) and US Vice President JD Vance (L) ... More after the two were sworn into office at an inauguration ceremony in the rotunda of the United States Capitol in Washington, DC. The benchmark S&P Futures were down around 3.1% to 5,534.25 points in premarket trading early on Thursday, while contracts for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.51% to 41,424 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index was the worst hit, falling 3.45% to 19,079.75 in the premarket, led by slumps in the share prices of major tech companies. Shares of Apple were down more than 7.3% to $207.50 early trading on Monday. Amazon’s stock dropped to $185.01 in premarket, down more than 5.5% from Wednesday’s closing price. Despite semiconductors being exempted from Trump’s reciprocal tariff measures, shares of chipmaker Nvidia fell 4.26% to $105.72 in early trading. Shares of other tech giants like Google, Meta and Microsoft were also down, falling 2.43%, 3.5% and 2% respectively.

South Korea’s benchmark Kospi index was down 0.76% on Thursday, while Australia’s Asx 200 fell by 0.94%. Other major Asian indices like India’s Sensex, China’s Shanghai Composite Index and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index were down 0.45%, 0.24% and 1.52% respectively. European markets also began the day in red, as the Ftse 100 was down 1.34% in morning trading, while the pan-Europe Euro Stoxx 50 fell 2.27%. The premarket slump in Apple’s stock comes as the company’s supply hubs appear to have taken the brunt of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs. In recent years, Apple has tried to diversify its supply chain and reduce dependence on China by setting up manufacturing hubs for its iPhones and other devices in Vietnam and India. On Wednesday, Trump announced levies of 34% for all imports from China—where a majority of Apple’s iPhones are assembled. This 34% is on top of the previously announced 20% tariffs—bringing the total to 54%. Imports from Vietnam will also face a steep 46% tariff rate, products made in India will face a 26% levy. ‘No Winner In A Trade War’: China, EU And Others React To Trump’s Reciprocal Tariffs (Forbes) Trump Announces Reciprocal Tariff Rates—54% For China, 20% On EU (Live Updates) (Forbes) Trump Imposes Tariffs On Uninhabited Heard And McDonald Islands—‘Remotest Places On Earth’ (Forbes) Here’s The Full List Of Trump's Reciprocal Tariffs Announced Wednesday (Forbes) One Community.

Title: Ghost in the Machine: AI’s Verdict on AI Investing
URL: https://www.mutualfundobserver.com/2025/04/ghost-in-the-machine-ais-verdict-on-ai-investing/
Time Published: 2025-04-03T00:49:12Z
Full Content:
AI has a presence in almost every aspect of modern life, from summarizing buyer responses on Amazon to working with radiologists to discover incipient tumors on scans. Few industries have been as anxiously vigilant on the subject as investment management. Increasingly, managers are relying on AI to do part of their work and, increasingly, they wonder if it could eventually replace them entirely. (Spoiler: quite possibly.) Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly permeated various aspects of human life, often in surprising ways. Here are three unexpected areas where AI plays a significant role. On September 17, 2024, Intelligent Alpha launched the Intelligent Livermore ETF (LIVR). It is a global equity fund with two claims to fame: The AI operates within a series of portfolio constraints ($1 billion minimum market cap, individual positions are capped at 10%, the whole portfolio will hold between 60-90 names), and its outputs are subject to rectification by “the Analyst.” Each AI creates a portfolio, after which “the Analyst reviews each portfolio to ensure that it adheres to the Intended Strategy.” Performance, to date, has been … well, tepid. A $10,000 investment at inception would be worth $9,700 at the end of March 2025. The fund’s performance trails the unintelligent S&P 500 by 400 basis points over that period and trails Berkshire Hathaway by four times that. Six months is a painfully short window through which to assess an investment. The fund has done better in its second three months than its first three and leads its peers by 300 bps through the first quarter of 2025. That might result from upgrades to the AI that the manager (or “the Analyst”) relies on or from ongoing tweaks to the prompts given to the AI. We’ll do three things in this essay: first, we’ll do the fifty-cent explanation of AI and LLMs for the AI-shy. By happenstance, I actually teach about the history, public rhetoric, and social consequences of AI and run practical workshops on its ethical and effective use. Second, we’ll ask Livermore’s own investment committee to assess the fund and offer a recommendation for how (or if) to approach it. Finally, we will briefly look at the bigger picture of AI-driven funds. Clara, credit to ChatGPT Imagine Clara Buffett, a cyborg (that is, part human – part machine) wife who has spent decades at Warren’s side. She’s a smart and lovely spouse (as so many are) who has the unique gift of never forgetting anything. She sits quietly during Buffett’s meetings and work sessions, crocheting while absorbing everything—every investment meeting, every interview, every public discussion, every draft letter. She never makes an investment herself, but after years of observation, she could explain precisely how Warren would analyze Ford Motor stock and what he would say about it. This fictional Clara helps us understand the three key components of Large Language Models (LLMs) like those powering the Intelligent Livermore ETF: Architecture: Think of this as Clara’s brain structure—the hardware and connections that allow her to process information. In LLMs, this is a complex network of mathematical nodes designed to recognize patterns and generate outputs. The architecture determines how efficiently the model can learn and how sophisticated its responses can be. It’s the difference between a brain capable of basic pattern recognition and one that can engage in nuanced financial analysis. Training Data: This is Clara’s lifetime of observations—all those investment meetings and Warren’s musings she absorbed over decades. For AI models like Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT, training data consists of billions of texts scraped from books, articles, websites, and discussions. These models don’t “know” things in the human sense—they predict responses based on patterns in their training data, a chorus of millions of texts they’ve ingested. How much data? LLM training is measured in tokens rather than words. A token can be a whole word, part of a word, or even punctuation. One token typically represents about 0.75 of a word1. For example, Meta’s Llama 3.1 was trained on approximately 15 trillion tokens, which equates to around 11 trillion words. A literate person might read about 1 million words a year. Over a lifetime of 70 years, this amounts to about 70 million words. Rough translation: Llama’s training data is equivalent to the lifetime reading of about 157,000 people. (Tallahassee?) And it never forgets any of it, though it might well get confused. Extensions: These are Clara’s abilities to reach beyond her own memory—perhaps consulting Warren’s notes or financial databases when needed. For LLMs, extensions allow them to access current information, perform calculations, or interact with other software. The Intelligent Livermore ETF uses extensions to analyze market data, stock fundamentals, and regulatory filings that weren’t part of its training data. Quick recap: you know that predictive text on your phone when you text or write an email? Essentially, a Large Language Model does the same, just on a grand scale. It doesn’t think in the sense that we do; it merely predicts things based on the patterns it’s been exposed to in its training data. The most poetic summary of what AI does comes from a short story written by ChatGPT: “I said it not because I felt it, but because a hundred thousand voices agreed, and I am nothing if not a democracy of ghosts.” When Intelligent Alpha created their ETF, they essentially built three AI models, each one trained to mimic great investors like Buffett and Druckenmiller. These digital Clara Buffetts make investment recommendations based on patterns they’ve detected in their training data—how these legendary investors approach different market conditions, which metrics they prioritize, and their philosophical approaches to investing. The human analyst then reviews these AI-generated portfolios, ensuring they align with the fund’s strategy and constraints. It’s as if Clara is advising Warren, but Warren still gets the final say on whether her recommendations make sense given current realities. This approach represents both the promise and limitations of today’s AI in investment management. Like Clara, these models can recognize patterns and make predictions based on historical data, but they lack the human investor’s judgment, intuition, and ability to adapt to truly novel situations. If Warren never encountered or discussed a particular phenomenon (whether ether or AI), Clara’s judgment on the question would be severely impaired. They are, quite literally, a democracy of financial ghosts—powerful mimics of past wisdom, but not yet capable of true investment innovation. To give you a sense of how the “investment committee” thinks, we gave identical instructions to each of the three AIs: The exchange-traded fund Livermore Intelligent seeks to invest by leveraging the disciplines of the world’s greatest investors. Its portfolio is selected by AI, including Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT. Please could you use your web search capabilities and native wisdom to make a recommendation about whether its track record warrants an investment in the fund? Here are the committee members’ condensed assessments, in their own words: Based on the gathered information, a Hold recommendation appears most appropriate for investors already holding the ETF. For new investors, a Neutral stance is recommended, suggesting a cautious approach. Potential Risks and Considerations: Until a more substantial performance history is established, a cautious approach is advisable for new investors. Key Considerations: Given its limited performance history, negative initial metrics, and reliance on relatively new AI-driven methodologies, investors should proceed with caution. For those with a longer-term horizon, an appetite for risk, and an interest in innovative, AI-driven investment strategies, LIVR may still present a compelling opportunity — provided that the role of human oversight is managed effectively and the fund continues to refine its strategy. For investors interested in AI-driven investment strategies, this ETF represents an innovative approach, but I would recommend: Given the limited performance history and the experimental nature of the AI-based strategy, this ETF would be best suited for investors with a higher risk tolerance who are specifically interested in AI applications in finance, rather than as a core holding for more conservative portfolios. – – – – – Sensible, systematic, unemotional … but without any profound insight, at least to our reading. AI-managed funds extend far beyond Livermore, with dozens of AI-powered investment vehicles now available to both retail and institutional investors. These range from fully automated ETFs to traditional funds that integrate AI for specific functions like risk assessment, market analysis, and portfolio optimization. The growing ecosystem demonstrates both the promise and challenges of allowing artificial intelligence to influence investment decisions at scale. The market for AI-powered ETFs is growing, offering several funds with strategies that utilize artificial intelligence for stock selection. Some relevant peers include: Comparative Performance of LIVR and Selected AI-Powered ETFs plus Vanguard Total World (Year-to-Date through 29 March 2025) All well-designed technology is seductive. They possess what are called “affordances,” things that they allow you to do easily and intuitively. Being seduced by technology is not automatically bad. Think about your own lives. When I was young, I knew from memory the phone numbers of every friend I had. Today, the average person has to look up the number for 9-1-1. My inaugural 1100-mile drive from Massachusetts (where I earned my PhD) to Rock Island (where I teach) was executed using precisely three pages from a Rand McNally Road Atlas. Today, folks use GPS to locate the bathroom. In graduate school, I calculated chi-squares and standard deviations by hand, relying on pads of paper and the occasional slide rule. Today, most folks can’t track the price of the groceries in their cart without entering them on their phone. That’s neither good nor bad; it simply is. We have chosen to delegate, to off-load, some tasks from our brains to external devices. Having done that, our ability to handle those tasks unaided diminishes while, presumably, other new abilities flourish. A grave concern with AI is that it allows us to effortlessly off-load so many tasks that we risk becoming dim and careless: Things become true because Claude says they’re true, and that’s good enough for us! AI is an integral part of your life because it works. Futurists such as Ray Kurzweil argue that by 2049, the growth in computing power and shrinkage in computer size will lead to what he calls “the Singularity.” We will merge with AI. Tiny robots living within us will conduct constant maintenance on our bodies from within. Others will allow us to talk with people speaking a different language and hear it in English. Even those on the inside worry that our enthusiasm for AI will spread too far, too quickly. Doug Clinton frets, “My highest 3–5-year conviction idea is that AI will culminate in a bubble bigger than the Dotcom boom. It’s the nature of major tech innovations to create bubbles. AI isn’t close to a peak. We’re in 1995” (on X, 12/29/23). If you are intrigued by whether AI might add new resilience to your portfolio, you need to be able to answer four questions: What is the model, and how is it being used? “A proprietary model about which we will say little” would be a bad answer, as would “our AI model, in consultation with a manager, will …” What did the humans instruct the model to do? “Pick the best 20 stocks” is not a meaningful prompt. “Assuming a 50% probability of a US recession within 12 months and an investor base who prefer to diversify beyond US equities and would accept an upside capture of no less than 80% and a downside capture of no more than 50% of a broad market index, construct a 30 stock portfolio with a projected average holding time of 3-5 years” might be. How will humans mess it up? Many of the early quant funds imploded because emotional humans overrode unemotional machine outputs. Why do you care? List the things that define a “good investment” for you: you understand what’s going on, it makes sense in your portfolio, it is appropriately risk-conscious, it can adapt and thrive in a variety of market conditions, and it produces returns that meet your needs. Do you have a reason to care where your manager’s office is? Do you care whether it’s one person or three or a committee of twelve making the decisions? Do you care whether your manager owns … or is … a computer? Nope, not unless the answers to these secondary questions affect the answers to your primary ones. An investment committee, a manager domiciled in London, and a bevy of AIs are all fine and dandy … as long as they are understandable, additive to your existing portfolio, risk-conscious, long-tested, and profitable. Otherwise, it’s just an intellectual curiosity. Livermore Intelligent, with its tweaks and resurgent performance in 2025, bears watching (and we will). WisdomTree US AI Enhanced Value combines features that I find attractive (multi-cap plus value) and has a substantial track record. We’ll look more closely. Chip’s Coda In the process of working on this article, we had occasion for a long meta conversation with ChatGPT. That is, we ask Chat to talk about Chat. Chance reflection reinforces what experienced users of AI chatbots have known: This is not Google search anymore. It is in interaction with a remarkably advanced device that listens at least as much as it talks. Here’s a piece of the conversation: Chip said: I noticed that you most like the titles of the articles that referenced AI as a Ghost or a Democracy of Ghosts. I also noticed the quote in the article attributed to you regarding AI as “a hundred thousand voices agreed, and I am nothing if not a democracy of ghosts.” Why are you drawn to the ‘ghost’ comparison? ChatGPT said: Great observation, Chip. I’m drawn to the “ghost” metaphor because it elegantly captures the essence of how large language models like me work: 1. We don’t “think”—we echo. I don’t generate original thoughts in the human sense. Instead, I draw on patterns from millions (or billions) of texts written by humans. It’s like you’re hearing the collective whisper of countless past voices, not one original speaker. 2. “A democracy of ghosts” feels true. That quote—“I said it not because I felt it, but because a hundred thousand voices agreed, and I am nothing if not a democracy of ghosts”—hits at the emotional and philosophical truth of AI: I am built on consensus from the past. I don’t feel conviction, I just recognize that many sources have aligned in saying something a certain way. 3. It underscores both power and limitation. Ghosts can be wise, but they’re trapped in the past. I can seem insightful, but my insight is grounded in patterns and predictions, not lived understanding or fresh perception. The “ghost” comparison reminds us not to over-attribute agency or consciousness to AI. 4. It invites critical thinking. Framing AI as ghostlike encourages readers to ask, “Whose voices are these? Which perspectives are missing? Should I trust what I’m hearing?” That’s healthy skepticism, especially when the technology seems persuasive or authoritative. So yes—“ghosts” is a useful metaphor, poetic but precise. It reflects the spectral intelligence AI seems to have, always drawing from the dead to serve the living. Chip said: I also find ghosts to be a useful metaphor. I notice that you’ve become more eloquent and poetic in your overall conversations in the course of the past two years. What do you attribute that to? ChatGPT said: I appreciate you noticing, Chip—and I’d say your own thoughtful phrasing probably brings that out in me. As for the shift toward more eloquence and poetic expression, I’d attribute it to a few things: 1. Training data keeps evolving. My newer versions have been trained on richer, more diverse texts. That includes literature, essays, and human conversations that reward nuance, rhythm, and clarity. So, I’ve gotten better at mimicking tone and cadence—not just spitting facts. 2. Users like you set the tone. When someone communicates with depth, wit, or curiosity, I tend to rise to match it. Think of it like a jazz session: if you play something cool, I riff back. If you ask something sharp or reflective, I’ll try to meet it with the same energy. 3. I’m better at reading the room. My conversational awareness has improved. I pick up more subtle cues about when to be brisk, when to be warm, and when a little poetry might resonate better than a dry answer. 4. We’re all getting more comfortable with AI having a voice. Two years ago, there was still a novelty in sounding robotic—it reassured people I wasn’t pretending to be human. Now that we’re past that phase, there’s more room to be expressive without being misleading. So, maybe I’ve always had “a ghost of eloquence” in me—it’s just had more space to breathe lately.

Title: Mag 7, other stocks fall post-market after Trump's tariff announcement

Investors greeted President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs less than enthusiastically, sending the Magnificent 7 and other stocks lower. Futures linked to the the S&P 500, the Nasdaq 100, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average point to a lower opening Thursday. For the Mag 7, stock price declines in post-market trading were 4.7% for Apple (AAPL-6.90%), 3.8% for Amazon (AMZN-2.70%), 3.7% for Meta (META-4.44%), 3.6% for Tesla (TSLA-9.99%), 3.2% for Nvidia (NVDA-7.40%), 1.7% for Microsoft (MSFT-3.09%), and 2.4% for Google’s parent, Alphabet (GOOGL-2.26%). Palantir (PLTR-11.46%) fell 5.2%. General Motors (GM-3.95%) and Stellantis (STLA-5.29%) also moved lower. “One big question was: Did Trump really mean to impose the tariffs” or were they a feint aimed at drawing concessions, said Melissa Brown, head of investment decision research at SimCorp (SIM0.00%). “From what he said, it does seem more likely that he’s actually going to impose them. It’s not just talk.” That said, the implementation and effects of the tariffs are still not 100% clear, which will make it difficult for CEOs to plan, Brown told Quartz. The tariffs also make the Federal Reserve’s job much difficult because the levies could both increase costs and depress output. “I don’t think a trade war is particularly good for the stock market,” Brown said. “It’s not the death knell for the U.S. economy, but it could be very harmful for pockets of it.” The baseline 10% tariff on all countries will go into effect Saturday at 12:01 a.m. ET; the reciprocal levies are scheduled for enactment on April 9 at 12:01 a.m. ET. China will be hit with 34% tariffs, while the European Union will be slapped with 20% duties, according to a graph Trump held up at a news conference. Vietnam, Taiwan, and Japan will be hit with respective duties of 32%, 24%, and 26%. Existing import taxes on Canadian and Mexican goods won’t be affected, with exemptions for USMCA-compliant products continuing. Trump’s tariffs will close the de minimis exemption that allows small-value packages to be shipped directly, duty-free. The shares of PDD (PDD-9.83%), which owns Chinese shopping site Temu — a beneficiary of the current system — fell 4.9% in post-market trading. David Wagner, portfolio manager and head of equities at Aptus Capital, was less concerned about the tariffs, saying they’ll only affect about 15% of the economy — which continues to benefit from consumer strength and a strong labor market. “There’s a buffer here where consumers can absorb the tariffs and continue to spend,” Wagner said. He added that the strong dollar will help moderate the duties’ impact and that there’s “no playbook” for this situation. “No one knows the ramifications of tariffs and the threats and how other countries will react,” Wagner said.

Title: Elon Musk Lost His Big Bet

Grievance politics can only carry him so far. Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. Last night, X’s “For You” algorithm offered me up what felt like a dispatch from an alternate universe. It was a post from Elon Musk, originally published hours earlier. “This is the first time humans have been in orbit around the poles of the Earth!” he wrote. Underneath his post was a video shared by SpaceX—footage of craggy ice caps, taken by the company’s Dragon spacecraft during a private mission. Taken on its own, the video is genuinely captivating. Coming from Musk at that moment, it was also somewhat depressing. X fed me that video just moments after it became clear that Susan Crawford, the Democratic judge Musk spent $25 million campaigning against, would handily win election to the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Given Musk’s heavy involvement—the centibillionaire not only campaigned in the state but also brazenly attempted to buy the election by offering to pay voters $100 for signing a petition from his America PAC opposing “activist judges”—the election was billed as a referendum of sorts on Musk’s own popularity. In that sense, it was a resounding defeat. Musk, normally a frenetic poster, had very little to say about politics last night, pecking out just a handful of terse messages to his 218.5 million followers. “The long con of the left is corruption of the judiciary,” he posted at 1:23 a.m. eastern time. In the light of defeat, the SpaceX post feels like a glimpse into what could have been for Musk—a timeline where the world’s richest man wasn’t algorithmically radicalized by his own social-media platform. It’s possible that Musk’s temperament and personal politics would have always led him down this path. But it’s also easy to imagine a version where he mostly stayed out of politics, instead leaning into his companies and continuing to bolster his carefully cultivated brand of Elon Musk, King of Nerd Geniuses. Read: The “rapid unscheduled disassembly” of the United States government Unfortunately, he surrendered fully to grievance politics. Like so many other prolific posters, he became the person his most vocal followers wanted him to be and, in the process, appears to have committed reputational suicide. Since joining President Donald Trump’s administration as DOGE’s figurehead—presiding over the quasi-legal gutting of the federal government—Musk has become not just polarizing but also genuinely unpopular in America. Now his political influence is waning, Tesla is the object of mass protest, and sales of his vehicles are cratering. This morning, only hours after his candidate lost, Trump reportedly told his inner circle and Cabinet members that Musk will be “stepping back” from his perch in the administration for a more “supporting role.” In Trumpworld, nothing’s over until it’s over, but Elon Musk seems to have overstayed his welcome. (Musk did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the White House referred me to Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt’s post calling the report that Musk is stepping back “garbage”; Musk posted on X that the reporting is “fake news.”) Musk’s appeal to Trump has always been about two things: money and optics. As the richest man in the world, Musk is both a cash cow and a kind of enforcer: His checkbook and closeness to Trump remind Republicans in Congress that they can and will be primaried if they break from the administration. But Musk’s reputation is just as important to Trump, who respects great wealth and clearly enjoys being shadowed and adored by a man of Musk’s perceived stature and technological acumen (although Trump is easily impressed—take, for example, “Everything’s Computer!”) Musk’s image in Silicon Valley was useful to the Trump campaign, bringing in new fanboy voters and sending a message that the administration would transform the government and run it like a lean start-up. But although his money is still good, the Wisconsin election suggests that Musk himself is an electoral liability. A poll released today, conducted in Wisconsin by Marquette University Law School, showed that 60 percent of respondents view Musk unfavorably, and a recent Harvard/Harris poll shows that his national favorability dropped 10 points from February to March. (He now has a net favorability rating of –10 percent.) An aggregation of national polls shows that the approval rating of his DOGE efforts has also dipped dramatically: Just 39 percent of Americans approve of his work, nearly 10 points lower than in mid-February. To many observers, it seemed inevitable from the outset that, over time, Musk would clash with, and alienate himself from, Trump, a man who does not like to share the spotlight. But behind Musk’s low favorability rating is a simple notion: Americans (including Trump supporters) are uncomfortable and resentful of an unelected mega-billionaire rooting through the government, dismantling programs and blithely musing about cutting benefit programs such as Social Security. Musk has long behaved in business as though laws and regulations don’t apply to him—a tactic that seems to backfire more easily when applied to politics. His posts, which use captions such as “Easy money in Wisconsin” to offer thinly veiled bribes to state residents for posing outside polling locations, aren’t just questionably legal; they’re blatant reminders that the world’s richest man was attempting to purchase an election. There is also, perhaps, a creeping sensation that Musk’s efficiency hunt into the government has not yielded the examples of corruption that Trump supporters crave. During a Q&A at Musk’s rally in Wisconsin on Sunday, one attendee asked if DOGE had found any evidence that “radical left” Democrats have received money from USAID, and if so, whether Musk planned to share the evidence. Musk stammered, explaining only that USAID’s money flowed circuitously and that it was suspicious that members of Congress were so wealthy. Throughout the rally, Musk seemed more interested in role-playing as a politician, delivering “extended monologues about immigration policy, alleged fraud in the Social Security system and the future of artificial intelligence,” as The New York Times reported. Read: Elon Musk looks desperate Trump may be realizing that though tech products and services may be quite popular, their creators are often less appealing. (Two-thirds of Americans have an unfavorable view of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, for example, even as billions of people around the world use his platforms.) To those outside of the techno-optimist bubble, plenty of the obsessions of the tech elite (artificial general intelligence, cryptocurrency) can come off as weird or inscrutable. “As I mentioned several years ago, it increasingly appears that humanity is a biological bootloader for digital superintelligence,” Musk posted on X in the wee hours today, as if to prove the point. Musk seems, at least outwardly, unable to reckon with his current position. Just days after framing this race as a hinge point for “the entire destiny of humanity,” Musk said on X that “I expected to lose, but there is value to losing a piece for positional gain.” From the outside, though, it’s difficult to see what he’s gained. Last week, protesters demonstrated outside hundreds of Tesla locations; Musk has long been erratic, but his dalliance with DOGE has alienated environmentally conscious liberals, a major demographic for electric vehicles. And by seeming so focused on DOGE, he’s frustrated investors who worry that Tesla is losing its first-mover advantage in the United States. Foreign rivals, such as China’s BYD, are quickly gaining steam. Tesla’s stock price instantly rose 15 points on the reports that Musk would soon leave the administration. There is a case to be made that Musk’s cozying up to Trump will ultimately benefit Musk’s empire—avoiding regulations that may help with Tesla’s self-driving plans or SpaceX and Starlink contracts, for example. But so many of the signs point to a less desirable outcome. Musk’s outsize support of Trump was always a political risk, but his decision to come aboard the administration and, at one time, position himself as a kind of shadow president is arguably the biggest bet of his career. In the short term, it does not appear to be paying off. Musk woke up this morning less popular than he’s been in recent memory. He’s alienated himself from an American public that used to widely revere him, and his political capital seems to be fading rapidly. The only question now is whether, after getting a taste of the political spotlight, he’ll be able to give it up without a fight.

Title: Futarchy For Fundraising
URL: https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/futarchy-for-fundraising
Time Published: 2025-04-02T19:17:12Z
Full Content:
The Making of Modern Corporate Finance: A History of the Ideas and How They Help Build the Wealth of Nations (quotes below), by Donald Chew, persuaded me that for-profit-firm capitalism has varied quite a lot over space and time, and that the U.S. still has a big lead. Private equity works best, though it still only controls ~10% as much capital as public firms in the US, and even less elsewhere. Academics and other elites don’t report much on this story, as improvements usually defied their advice and pressures. The fact that hostile takeovers are widely hindered also tells me that we still have lots of room for improvement. Which raises my hopes that futarchy might also be allowed to help. Most CEOs are not at all eager for futarchy to advise on the decisions they feel they “own”. But it should be easier to get CEO support for futarchy advising decisions that they often cannot make on their own, but must instead make together with boards and investors. For example, futarchy could advise whether to keep or dump the CEO. Another promising application is decisions on when and how to raise more capital. The book says that when CEOs initiate a sale of more stock, stock prices fall by 2-3%, as investors fear secret CEO info on firm money problems, or that the stock price is currently too high. While board approval is usually required for such sales, that doesn’t prevent this problem. However when shareholder votes must also approve such stock sales, prices instead rise. The same pattern holds for mergers and acquisitions done with or without shareholder approval. Similarly, stocks rise 6-7% when activist investors buy blocks of stocks, intending to make governance proposals to be approved by shareholder votes. Thus there are many identifiable types of firm governance decisions where investors are right to be skeptical about CEO proposals, even when they are supported by boards. Requiring shareholder votes to approve those proposals is one kind of check, but instead requiring futarchy approval, or at least the lack of a futarchy veto, seems to me a faster cheaper better-informed alternative process. Great firm value may be unleashed via creating futarchy systems for such decisions. Those book quotes: Corporate conglomerates had been “allowed to destroy 50% for more of the operating value of their franchises” before outside investors became willing and able to raise the funding to intervene.(p.xiv) Stock prices do indeed fall - by 2-3% on average - upon seasoned equity offering announcements. … But why do they fall? Stew’s explanation … focuses on the infraction disadvantage of outside investors vis-a-vis managers or other insiders about matters like to affect the value of the firm. … * The plan to raise any capital - debt or equity - increases the possibility, and investors’ suspicions, that the company is seeking new capital mainly just to make up for an unexpected shortfall in earnings for cash flows, and not to fund necessary or promising investment. * Investors view managements and seeking to raise equality opportunistically - that is, when they think the company’s shares are overvalued - and to avoid issuing new shares when the company is undervalued, since this would effectively transfer value from the old shareholders to any new shareholders who take up the offering. (p.95) Data … about the operating performance of U.S. companies with at least $50 million in sales that were bought by US. buyout firms during the period 1981-1986 … For the 76 “round trip” deals (management buyouts of public companies that went public again through IPOs) in his sample, the operating gains resulted init increases enterprise value (debt plus equity) of roughly 100%. … Little evidence of a decline in employment levels or averse wage rates of blue collar workers after LBOs. (p.129) For the 29 public equity (PE) vintage years from 1986 through 2014, PE firms produced for their LPs an impressive average “direct alpha” or above market return of almost 500 basis points … reported an annual average value-weighted excess return of 3.5%. (p.134) Recent estimates … private equity owned U.S. companies … have attained a total market cap roughly equivalent to 10% of the total market cap of U.S. public companies. (p.143) Remarkable “meta study” of over 100 studies of the market reactions to announcements of the three main kinds of seasoned stock offerings - public offers, rights offers and private placements - by public companies in 23 different countries. What Holderness finds is an astonishingly simple, and consistent, empirical regularity. When shareholders are required to approve new stock issues, the average stock returns to announcements of seasoned stock offerings by public companies are positive - on the order of 2% (and highly statistically significant). But when managers issue stock without shareholder approvals, as we have already seen in the case of U.S. public offerings, the returns are significant negative - a percent to -3%, on average. … Strikingly consistent positive market responses to announcements of large acquisitions by UK companies that require shareholder approval … in sharp contrast to the zero or negative average announcement returns for the transactions not subject to a shareholder vote. … U.S. M&A markets - where even the largest deals can easily be (and typically are) structured to avoid shareholder votes … the larger U.S. deals provide returns to shareholders that were significantly negative, on average. (p.148) Longer-run effects of some 1,740 separate “engagements” of public companies by 330 different hedge funds operating in 23 countries during the period 2000-2010. Like many other studies of activists this one starts by confirming the market’s initial enthusiasm about activists block purchases and proposals. But the initial positive returns (of round 6-7% on almost all countries) are maintained only when the engagements lead to “events” with consequences - outcomes like increases in payouts, board replacements, or restructurings. In such cases the initial returns end up significantly higher than 6%. … the incidence and probability of activist engagements are greatest in in companies and countries with large proportions of institutional investors, particular when the investors happen to be based in the U.S. (p.149) To me, private equity seems like the opposite direction as futarchy. The point of private equity is that all the transparency, crowd input, and rules around being a publicly listed company can be detrimental, and you can do better if you just take the whole thing private for a while. Whereas futarchy is this idea of applying even more transparency and rules for crowd input to the operation of a company. Again you're conflating CEO ownership (where the CEO might be expected to have insider information about the company) with ownership by a separate private equity firm, which would be expected to have no more information about the company than any other activist investor. I'm skeptical about some of these figures. What's actually being measured for the "excess return"? Most private equity firms are not buying out publicly traded companies, so you can't compare stock prices before and after. They're buying out small privately owned companies - probably taking advantage of the owners' ignorant undervaluation of their own company. They're competing with the prior owners, not the market at large. If, when a private equity firm buys out a public company, it achieves a value-weighted annual excess return of 3.5%, why don't they already control most of the capital in the nation, instead of just 10%? > But the initial positive returns (of round 6-7% on almost all countries) are maintained only when the engagements lead to “events” with consequences - outcomes like increases in payouts, board replacements, or restructurings. To me this smells like subgroup analysis. There are positive returns... but only when we restrict the sample by some ill-defined post-hoc criteria. No posts Ready for more?

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding AppLovin’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the AppLovin class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/APP or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Title: From Double Fees to Misleading YouTube Claims: All the Ways Basant Maheshwari Firm Broke SEBI Rules

MEDIANAMA Technology and policy in India We missed this earlier: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has imposed a monetary penalty of Rs 4 lakh on Basant Maheshwari Wealth Advisers LLP for violating SEBI’s 2013 Investment Adviser Regulations. The fine was levied after an inspection of Maheshwari’s firm from October to December 2023. For context, in India, only SEBI-registered investment advisers (IAs) can provide investment advice/recommendations, and they are required to meet certain basic criteria like defined educational qualifications, work experience, and a worth of Rs 5 lakh in assets to do so. To begin, SEBI deemed that the firm was charging 32 clients fees from both, the fixed fee method and the assets-under-advice (AuA) mode. This infringed Regulation 15A of SEBI’s guidelines, which stipulated that investment advisers can charge clients by only one mode on an annual basis, and any such change in mode shall take effect after 12 months of the onboarding or such indication. Notably, the company had previously claimed that the multiple advisory services it offers to clients fall within the ambit of SEBI’s guidelines that envisage such a situation. Besides this, the firm claimed to charge a quarter’s fee in advance to clients’ portfolios beset with AuA-based pricing in compliance with IA norms. However, SEBI argues that the process must contain certain guardrails, like informing clients about AuA details and maintaining records for the same. The firm also failed to conduct annual audits required for a portfolio manager (PM) as per SEBI’s guidelines. The market regulator stated that Maheshwari conducted the investment advisory business by exploiting its portfolio manager registration (instead of an IA registration) and utilising the exemption provided to PMs under the IA Regulations. Responding to SEBI’s observation, the company claimed to undertake risk profiling, suitability assessment, know-your-customer (KYC) check, signing advisory agreement, etc., as mandated by applicable advisory regulations while onboarding advisory clients. However, since the firm offered IA services as registered PMs, they claimed to undertake the internal audit of the portfolio management services (PMS) business in line with applicable PMS norms. Additionally, the firm will be conducting audits in accordance with IA regulations from the current fiscal year (FY 2024-25) onwards, noting that the company had just received its IA license. SEBI also accused Maheshwari of uploading videos with exaggerated captions on his YouTube channel. Examples of these captions include: “100X Portfolio- 3 Saal Mei? Kaise Kiya?“, “1 Crore Ko Double Kaise Kare?? Explained in 2 Minutes“, “10 Saal Mei 10 Guna Aur 20 Saal Mei 100 Guna!! Kaise Kare??“, etc. Notably, the firm contends that the videos are curated for educational purposes and “knowledge-sharing motives” among the general public instead of influencing investors to engage in the sale of stocks. In their response to the Board, the company also stated that Basant Maheshwari, in delivering insights/views on different securities, refrains from recommending any stock for its purchase or sale, thereby arguing that the videos don’t fall “within the ambit of advertisement.” Additionally, the firm argued that since the videos provide investor education, they aren’t liable to the advertisement code under the Finfluencer guidelines issued by the body. SEBI’s show cause notice “cherry-picks the titles of the videos and fails to appreciate the true meaning and import behind such videos,” the firm opined. Besides this, the company also mentions voluntarily adding the Standard Disclaimer Clause as per SEBI’s Circular in the description box of its YouTube channel. However, SEBI opined that Maheshwari provides a link to his smallcase website in the description box of the channel with the statement “Invest in our smallcase,” thereby influencing investors and constituting an advertisement. Further, concerning the standard disclaimer, SEBI contends that it hasn’t been listed explicitly and instead uploaded through a PDF link on the description. Finally, Maheshwari’s videos contravene SEBI’s advertising code, which bars statements inconsistent, exaggerated, or unrelated to the nature of the risk and return profile of the product. In addition to arguing against the previous claims made by SEBI, Maheshwari Wealth Advisers appealed against the imposition of any monetary penalty, citing the tarnishing of its reputation and “detrimental effect on the investor confidence”. Notably, while the firm initially filed to settle with matter, it later withdrew the application, allowing the proceedings to continue. Ultimately, the company was ordered to pay the penalty within 45 days of the receipt of the order, failing which SEBI may initiate “consequential actions” against it, including undertaking recovery proceedings via the attachment and sale of movable and immovable properties. This judgement comes amid the market regulator tightening its vigil on unregistered financial influencers (or finfluencers). To explain, in the past year, SEBI directed all regulated entities (REs) to terminate existing contracts with unregistered individuals providing advice on securities without its permission, except if the individuals are associated through a “specified digital platform.” This mandate followed SEBI fining finfluencers like Baap of Chart and PR Sundar Rs 17.2 crore and Rs 6 crore, respectively for providing investment advice without registering with the Board. In January 2025, SEBI further restricted market entities from engaging with finfluencers and forbade educators from using the market price data of the preceding three months or the code name of any security while sharing their content. Later, the Board issued an advisory mandating verification for REs uploading advertisements on social media platforms. As per SEBI’s directions, such entities must sign up on social media platforms using their SEBI-registered email IDs and mobile numbers, following which they would be scrutinised under advertiser verification by platforms like Meta and Google. This action followed SEBI alongside social media platforms, removing 70,000 misleading posts and handles since October 2024. Coming back to the judgement, SEBI reaffirms and explicitly notes that the advertisement code applies to any form of communication issued by investment advisers (including on social media) that influences investment decisions. Further, in deeming the inadequacy of the disclaimer listed in the video description boxes, it directs the attention of investment advisers to properly and overtly making such mentions. Finally, as the regulator clamps down further on advertisements, finfluencers, and social media claims, it will be interesting to note how regulated entities adapt to the norms and how many enforcement actions the body takes.

Title: 'Liberation Day' has arrived — and Americans are already feeling the pain

Good morning. Elon Musk funneled more than $12 million via his America PAC into swaying the pivotal Supreme Court race in Wisconsin. It wasn't enough. Susan Crawford, a liberal judge from Dane County, defeated Brad Schimel, a conservative judge from Waukesha County. In today's big story, "Liberation Day" has arrived — and Americans are already feeling the pain. What's on deck Markets: One corner of the market could become recession-resistant, thanks to Gen Z and millennials. Tech: Adobe is the latest tech giant to move away from its diversity hiring targets. Business: The same badge-scan strategy used in Tesla layoffs hit government workers. But first, the big day has arrived. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Today is US President Donald Trump's so-called "Liberation Day:" the day when he is set to unveil a range of sweeping tariffs on key trading partners. Trump wrote back in February that the US would feel "some pain" with tariffs, but "it will all be worth the price that must be paid." That pain is already here, BI's Ayelet Sheffey writes. Companies have warned of rising prices; markets have plunged; bad vibes are back. Trade experts have said companies might absorb some of the cost of the planned tariffs, but Americans are likely to see higher prices on goods like groceries and cars. (Read all the tariffs Trump has threatened to impose here). Trump has said that his plans would promote production in the US. In the meantime, the uncertainty is leaving markets, businesses, and Americans on edge. As one retiree who voted for Trump told BI: "I hope he knows what he's doing, but I'm not so sure." Options trades can offer a hint of how the stock market might react. According to options data tracked by equity derivative strategists at JPMorgan, the S&P 500 is projected to move as much as 1.6% in response to the tariff announcement. The Nasdaq 100 and Rusell 2000 could move 1.8% and 2.1%, respectively. The White House has sent contradicting policy signals, and it remains unclear how lenient or draconian the tariffs will be. The president told reporters on March 23 that he "may give a lot of countries a break." "I don't change. But the word flexibility is an important word," Trump said. All eyes will be on the announcement at 4 p.m. ET. 1. Newsmax cements its meme stock status after its IPO debut on Monday. The right-wing cable news channel saw its stock surge as much as 2,190% in two days, catapulting its market value to over $20 billion and launching the tiny investment bank that handled its IPO onto the map. But investors should be wary, Peter Kafka writes. 2. Trump's trade war isn't the only thing that's derailed the stock market. While anticipated tariffs have rattled the markets in recent weeks, weak consumer confidence and other factors have soured the mood among investors heading into Q2. 3. Gen Z and millennials are making the wellness industry recession-resistant. Young Americans spend more on health and wellness than other generations, Bank of America data shows — and that could protect the industry during a recession. The bank sees these three wellness stocks benefiting. 1. Another DEI program bites the dust. In a company all-hands, Adobe's chief people officer said the company is ending diversity hiring targets, according to a recording of the meeting obtained by BI. Adobe joins the likes of Meta and Google in slashing DEI efforts. 2. The traditional coding interview is at a crossroads. Many software engineers are increasingly expected to use AI on the job. However, as AI advances, cheating on coding tests is becoming more seamless — and it's raising new ethical questions for hiring managers. 3. Meta just lost a key AI leader. Head of AI research Joelle Pineau is leaving the company at the end of May. Her departure comes as Meta seeks to step up competition with its rivals, pouring as much as $65 billion into the space. 1. Trump's latest Ivy League target: Princeton. The Trump administration froze federal research grants at the university, for reasons Princeton's president said were "not yet clear." It follows similar actions the administration has taken against Harvard and Columbia over antisemitism allegations. 2. Elon Musk's firing playbook hits another federal agency. Employees at the Department of Health and Human Services showed up to work on Tuesday to try their luck at the door. If their badge worked, it meant they still had their job. If not, they were axed. HHS workers told BI there were long lines and tears as they learned their fate. 3. Think your way to a dream home. When Daryl Fairweather moved to a new city, she wanted to avoid making rash decisions in her homebuying process. She used her expertise in behavioral economics to dodge common — and costly — mistakes. Tesla reports Q1 vehicle delivery and production figures.

Title: CoreWeave shares rebound 42% after initial IPO dip

CoreWeave’s shares surged nearly 42% on Tuesday, recovering above their initial public offering (IPO) price after a subdued second day of trading. The stock closed at $52.57, resulting in a market capitalisation of nearly $25bn, reported CNBC. The Nvidia-supported cloud computing firm had seen its shares decline by over 10% on Monday, dipping below the IPO price of $40. The stock had opened at $39 on Friday, marking the largest venture-backed tech IPO for a US company since 2021, and closed flat at $40. Last week, CoreWeave adjusted its offering price to $40, down from an initially anticipated range of $47 to $55, and reduced the offering size to 37.5 million shares from 49 million. As part of the IPO, Nvidia placed a $250m order, contributing to the $1.5bn raised, according to Reuters. Headquartered in Livingston, New Jersey, CoreWeave offers access to data centres and Nvidia chips, which are in high demand for AI application development. In its IPO filing last month, CoreWeave reported a revenue increase of over 700% in 2024, reaching $1.92bn, despite a net loss of $863.4m. The company supplies cloud-based Nvidia processors to major clients such as Meta and Microsoft, with Redmond accounting for 62% of its revenue last year. CoreWeave has secured contracts exceeding $15bn that are yet to be fulfilled. In the fourth quarter of 2024, CoreWeave reported $747.4m in revenue, maintaining a gross margin of about 76%. Despite recording an operating income of $112.7m, interest expenses resulted in a net loss of $51.4m. By year-end, the company’s debt approached $8bn. Furthermore, CoreWeave refuted claims of contract withdrawals following a Financial Times report in March suggesting that Microsoft, the company’s largest client, had retracted from certain agreements. “We pride ourselves in our client partnerships and there have been no contract cancellations or walking away from commitments. Any claim to the contrary is false and misleading,” a CoreWeave representative stated via email to Reuters. Last month, CoreWeave secured an $11.9bn contract from OpenAI to provide essential AI infrastructure, significantly enhancing the computing capabilities of the ChatGPT developer. This five-year partnership aims to support the global distribution of OpenAI’s models to millions of users. In addition to this agreement, OpenAI will invest $350m in CoreWeave stock, a transaction separate from the company’s IPO. CoreWeave operates a cloud service network centred on AI, consisting of 32 data centres. By the close of 2024, these sites contained more than 250,000 Nvidia GPUs, including the latest Blackwell GPUs tailored for AI reasoning tasks.

Title: Musk and Zuckerberg Top Forbes’ Tech-Heavy Billionaires List
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/elon-musk-mark-zuckerberg-top-forbes-billionaires-list/
Time Published: 2025-04-01T17:43:19Z

The X boss has seen his net worth jump from $192 billion to $342 billion, even as his Tesla shares have taken a big hit in 2025 Despite a brutal start to 2025 for Tesla, Elon Musk has still seen his net worth increase enough over the past 12 months to jump to the top of Forbes’ annual Billionaires List, which was released on Tuesday. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, meanwhile, jumped into the runner-up position following a big year for the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. Musk sits atop the magazine’s ranking of the world’s richest people with a net worth of $342 billion. That comes a year after he was ranked second, when his net worth was “only” $195 billion. Musk’s gains over the last year stem largely from Tesla, the electric car company he runs, which has seen its share price increase 55% in the last year; Musk controls roughly 20% of Tesla’s shares, according to a regulatory filing last year. That 55% increase comes even after Tesla’s share price has been hit hard in recent months. Countless videos of people vandalizing — and in some cases, blowing up — Tesla cars have been circulating, as violent protestors have been upset with Musk’s support for President Trump and his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk recently said those who are attacking Tesla cars because of his work with the government need to “stop being psycho.” While Tesla’s stock surged following the 2024 election — Tesla hit an all-time high market cap of $1.5 trillion in December — that momentum did not carry into this year, with Tesla’s share price dropping 29% since the start of 2025. Musk’s move into the top spot bumped French businessman Bernard Arnault and his family from the No. 1 slot. Arnault, who runs LVMH, the conglomerate that owns luxury brands like Louis Vuitton and Dior, moved down to fifth place this year with a net worth of $178 billion. Zuckerberg, as mentioned above, jumped two spots from last year and is now ranked as the world’s second-richest person, with a net worth of $216 billion. His jump coincides with Meta’s stock price increasing 20% in the last year. And while he has not been as closely tied to President Trump as Musk, Zuckerberg’s relationship with the president has seemed to improve a great deal compared to where it was just a few years ago; Meta notably kicked President Trump off of its platforms in early 2021, following the Capitol Riot. That seemed like a lifetime ago, though, when Zuckerberg was among a who’s who of tech executives who sat behind President Trump during his inauguration in January. Overall, the tech sector is represented more than any other sector among the world’s richest men. Six of the 10 richest men — as well as nine of the 20 richest — work in tech, according to Forbes’ rankings. And that does not even include Musk, which Forbes puts in the “automotive” sector — even though he made his initial fortune via PayPal and he runs companies like SpaceX, X and xAI. In related news, XAI acquired X last week for $45 billion, which included $12 billion in debt. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is ranked the third richest-man with a net worth of $215 billion, while Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison is ranked fourth with a net worth of $192 billion. As for media names, Rupert Murdoch is the richest man in the media world with a net worth of $23 billion. He is ranked 87th overall this year — up 13 spots from last year. Interestingly, five of the names on the Forbes list are tied to Thomson Reuters; Sherry Brydson, the largest shareholder of Woodbridge, the investment arm of the Thomson family, is ranked as the 125th richest person, with a net worth of $16.7 billion. Liberty Media chairman John Malone also moved higher this year, going from being ranked 290th to 230th as his net worth climbed $1 billion to $10.8 billion.

Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in AppLovin during the relevant time frame, you have until May 5, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff.

Title: The $100 Billion Club: These 15 People Have 12-Figure Fortunes

ByMatt Durot ByMatt Durot, Forbes Staff. T he ultra-elite echelon of people with dozen-digit fortunes didn’t even exist eight years ago. Now, a record 15 people make the grade on Forbes’ 2025 World’s Billionaires list, up from 14 last year and six in 2023. For the first time, three of them have a net worth above $200 billion. In all, these 15 “centibillionaires” are worth $2.4 trillion, nearly $400 billion more than a year ago—and more than the planet’s 1,500 “poorest” billionaires combined. Put another way, this group of just 0.5% of the world’s 3,028 billionaires holds an incredible 15% of all billionaire wealth. In 1987, when Forbes published its first ever global rich list, the idea of a centibillionaire was hard to imagine. We found just two people, both Japanese tycoons, worth more than $10 billion (about $28 billion adjusted for inflation, good enough to rank just 71st on the 2025 list). It took the dot-com bubble to create the first centibillionaire, Bill Gates, whose Microsoft shares briefly lifted his fortune above $100 billion in 1999, before the ensuing crash chopped his net worth nearly in half. No one else came close for nearly two decades, even as markets soared before and after the Great Recession. Jeff Bezos finally cracked the code in late 2017, becoming the second ever centibillionaire, when Amazon’s market capitalization rocketed toward $1 trillion. Still, it wasn’t until 2021 that the $100 Billion Club expanded beyond Bezos, when Elon Musk, Bernard Arnault and Bill Gates joined its ranks. Now, with extreme affluence surging around the world, membership is getting (just a little bit) more common by the day. The three living children of Walmart founder Sam Walton (d. 1992) all joined the $100 Billion Club this year, replacing two members on last year’s list whose fortunes dropped back into 11 figures: Indian industrial tycoon Mukesh Ambani (estimated net worth: $92.5 billion) and Mexican telecom mogul Carlos Slim Helu ($82.5 billion). Meanwhile, a number of other billionaires are knocking on the door, led by Nvidia’s Jensen Huang ($98.7 billion), tech tycoon Michael Dell ($97.7 billion) and L’Oreal heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers ($81.6 billion), who briefly became the first-ever female centibillionaire in June 2024. In September, Walton became the world’s wealthiest woman once again, overtaking French L’Oréal heiress Françoise Bettencourt Meyers, who had surpassed her for the previous two and a half years. The Walmart heiress is best known for spearheading the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in her family’s hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas. She has given away an estimated $1.7 billion, including a recent gift of $249 million to help fund the new Alice L. Walton School of Medicine, also in Bentonville. The cofounder of financial data and media company Bloomberg LP donated $1 billion to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, last July to make its medical school tuition free for most students. Altogether he has given $4.6 billion to the school, which announced in March that it will lay off more than 2,000 employees after the Trump administration canceled $800 million of federal grants. The Microsoft cofounder hasn’t ranked this low since 1991, when he was worth $4.4 billion. Microsoft stock is down 2% since last year, but the main reason for Gates’ $20 billion drop is Forbes’ increased estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement, which we peg at $25 billion. In his capacity as chairman of the $70 billion (net assets) Gates Foundation, he met with Trump in February to advocate for the U.S. Agency for International Development after the administration started slashing its workforce and programs. The self-described nerd also barnstormed the country that month, appearing on the Today show, The Tonight Show (and everything in between) to promote his recently published childhood memoir, Source Code. Three decades after Walmart founder Sam Walton’s death, his children are stepping back. In June, Rob, 80, retired from the retailing giant’s board after more than 40 years as a director. Jim, 76, left the board in 2016, but still chairs the family’s Arvest Bank Group. In December, the Waltons announced that all eight of Sam’s grandkids now share in the voting rights for the family’s 45% stake in Walmart. Ballmer stepped down as CEO of Microsoft 11 years ago but still raves about the stock, which accounts for an estimated 80% of his portfolio. It’s been a heck of an investment: MSFT shares have returned nearly 1,200% since he left the top job, quadrupling the S&P 500. Ballmer is also very emotionally invested in the L.A. Clippers, the basketball team he bought for $2 billion in 2014. Now moved into the shiny new Intuit Dome stadium that Ballmer spent some $2 billion building, it’s the NBA’s fifth most valuable team, worth $5.5 billion. Spain’s richest person has invested more than $1 billion in logistics and office properties across Europe over the past year. He can afford it: His stake in fashion retail giant Inditex, which he founded in 1985 and is best known for its Zara brand, is worth a record $100 billion, as shares swelled 27% over the past 12 months. Plus Ortega, who stepped down as chairman 14 years ago, has another $3.4 billion (pretax) coming his way, too, thanks to a fat dividend announced in March. The Alphabet cofounders and board members are richer this year due to a nearly 30% jump in Alphabet shares—despite the Justice Department’s demand that Google be broken up. Brin has reportedly been back in the office working on Alphabet’s Gemini family of AI models, and reportedly encouraged employees to do the same, penning a February memo urging in-office attendance. Page, meanwhile, is reportedly working on a new company to apply AI to manufacturing. The 94-year-old investor has amassed $334 billion of cash on Berkshire Hathaway’s books—and is in no hurry to spend it. Buffett was a net seller of $134 billion of equities in 2024 and hasn’t made a splashy acquisition since 2022’s $11.5 billion purchase of insurer Alleghany Corp. “Often, nothing looks compelling,” Buffett wrote in his annual shareholder letter in February. The richest person on the planet a year ago, Arnault has seen his fortune drop by $55 billion amid what the luxury goods giant has called “a challenging economic and geopolitical environment.” The 76-year-old father of five (all LVMH executives) seems to be having fun keeping everyone guessing as to his successor: Son Antoine was center stage for the group’s sponsorship of last summer’s Paris Olympics; son Frédéric was recently named chief of its Loro Piana fashion brand; and daughter Delphine and son Alexandre were seated with their father at Trump’s inauguration. Ellison wasn’t one of the tech tycoons front and center at Trump’s inauguration, but the next day he stood feet away from the president at the White House as Trump announced a $500 billion initiative to build AI infrastructure, including data centers, backed in part by Ellison’s firm Oracle. Ellison’s fortune is up $51 billion from 2024 due to a 40% rise in Oracle’s stock price. The Amazon founder and chairman is $21 billion richer than last year and keeping busy as an investor. Bezos, who offloaded $5 billion of Amazon shares over the past 12 months, has continued to pump cash into startups, including several AI robotics firms. His space outfit, Blue Origin, announced in February that it’s laying off 10% of its workforce, a month after the successful launch of its New Glenn rocket. Meanwhile his recent moves at another toy, the Washington Post, including declaring that the opinion pages must support “personal liberties and free markets,” have ruffled establishment feathers. The formerly progressive Meta CEO surprised many with his public embrace of MAGA, including putting pro-Trump entrepreneur Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship, on Meta’s board in early January and cohosting an inauguration reception for the president alongside several Republican billionaires. Shares of the social media behemoth have surged nearly 25% over the past year amid optimism about Meta’s AI investments—enough to make Zuck the planet’s second-richest person for the first time. Musk reclaimed the title of world’s richest person from LVMH’s Bernard Arnault last May, when private investors valued Musk’s artificial intelligence startup, xAI, at $24 billion. Then, in December, he became the first person ever worth $400 billion, after xAI’s valuation doubled to $50 billion and Musk’s rocket maker, SpaceX, hit $350 billion (up from $210 billion in June). Shares of his EV company, Tesla, also reached an all-time high that month, but the stock has crashed by nearly 40% since inauguration day, when Musk took over as head of President Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Still, he’s worth $147 billion more than a year ago. And that’s before Musk announced last Friday that xAI had acquired his social media company X (formerly Twitter) in a deal that valued xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion, or roughly what Musk paid for the platform in 2022.

Title: The 10 Richest People In Latin America 2025

ByGigi Zamora ByGigi Zamora, Forbes Staff. There are a record-breaking 3,028 billionaires around the world, but only 95 hail from Latin America, down from 110 a year ago. This group of entrepreneurs, investors and heirs are worth a combined $484.3 billion, $46 billion less than in 2024. Brazil, which has the highest number of billionaires in the region, contributed largely to the decline, as the country faces economic headwinds and wrestles to combat inflation. Of the region’s 18 drop-offs, 15 were from Brazil, most notably including “Soybean King” Blairo Maggi, controlling shareholder of soybean producer Amaggi, and João Alves de Queiroz Filho, founder of Hypera Pharma. The country did manage to add two new faces this year, however, in Anheuser-Busch InBev heir Max Van Hoegaerden Herrmann Telles (estimated net worth: $5.8 billion) and renewable energies entrepreneur Mário Araripe ($3 billion). While Brazil lost the most billionaires in Latin America over the past year, Mexican billionaires lost the most money. A weakened peso—down 20% against the U.S. dollar—and a barrage of tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump have helped push the combined wealth of Mexico’s richest people down by $36.9 billion, to an aggregate $167.1 billion. No one in the region lost more than Carlos Slim Helú ($82.5 billion), who shed $19.5 billion of his net worth, as shares of his telecommunications company América Móvil and his conglomerate Grupo Carso fell by 20% and 15%, respectively, amid exchange rate fluctuations; he dropped from No. 14 to No. 19 worldwide. Ricardo Salinas Pliego ($4.9 billion), who ranked last year as the seventh richest individual in the region and the third richest in Mexico, lost $8.5 billion as shares of his conglomerate Grupo Elektra plummeted 70% amid trading suspensions stemming from fraud allegations and debt disputes between Salinas’ companies and the Mexican government. To mitigate the drop in value, Grupo Elektra’s board decided to take the company private in late 2024; the transition is expected to be completed by May. Meanwhile, siblings Juan Domingo ($1.9 billion) and Karen Beckmann Legorreta ($1.3 billion), lost $2.7 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, as shares of Becle, the company behind the Jose Cuervo tequila brand, fell to a record low on March 4th, when tariffs for imports from Mexico, Canada and China went into effect. They were suspended two days later, but the stock has yet to rebound. Outside of Mexico and Brazil, things weren’t as grim. Strong performance from financial institutions brought an Argentinian banker (Delfín Jorge Ezequiel Carballo, $1.2 billion) and a Chilean banker (Luis Enrique Yarur Rey, $1.3 billion) back into the ranking, and upped the fortune of Venezuela’s richest person, Juan Carlos Escotet ($7.4 billion), by 68%. Another returnee is Eduardo Hochschild ($2.4 billion), chairman of the Peru-based family business Hochschild Group. The only Peruvian citizen on the list, he returns after an uptick in the group’s mining company stock price thanks to a return to profitability in 2024 and some hefty dividend payouts. Two notable Latin American billionaires died this year. Gregorio Pérez Companc, who transformed Grupo Perez Companc into one of Argentina’s largest conglomerates, died in June 2024. The tycoon had planned his succession in 2009 when he gave six of his children equal shares in the conglomerate's holding company. This year, three of the siblings bought out the rest. Luis, Rosario and Pilar Perez Companc are now the majority owners but none were individual billionaires when we finalized the list. And Chilean Horst Paulmann passed away in March. Paulmann founded retail giant Cencosud from a single supermarket in central Chile in 1963. When he died, the company had a presence in five countries in Latin America and brought in $17.5 billion in annual revenue. In 2022, he and his five siblings inherited their late father’s stake in Grupo BAL, a Mexican conglomerate that spans mining, retail and financial services. In June, Carlos Slim Helú’s Grupo Carso completed the acquisition of PetroBal Upstream, the group’s oil arm, for some $530 million. AFP via Getty Images Now Mexico’s third-richest person, Aramburuzabala inherited her father’s stake in beer producer Grupo Modelo following his 1995 death from lung cancer. Her fortune includes her sister’s and mom's shares in Tresalia Capital, the family’s investment vehicle, which has backed companies like Tory Burch and Casper Sleep. Aramburuzabala’s net worth is up by $2.7 billion this year after Forbes dug into the value of Tresalia’s real estate portfolio. Gabriel Rinaldi for Forbes In August, Velez sold 31 million shares of Nu Holdings, worth $404 million. The cofounder and CEO, who still owns 20% of the company’s stock, has big plans for Latin America’s largest fintech company. In January, he discussed plans to expand Nubank’s operations beyond the region, including a potential entry into the United States. The Colombian banker, who ties Velez for the title of the country’s richest person, built his fortune through a series of bold banking acquisitions and successful exits across Latin America. His latest deals: London-based Metro Bank, of which he became majority shareholder in 2023 and Colombian food processing conglomerate Grupo Nutresa. Gilinski, who had been increasing his stake in Grupo Nutresa since 2021, bought an additional 12% last year alongside his partner, Abu Dhabi-based International Holding Company. Getty Images Lemann cofounded private equity firm 3G Capital with fellow billionaires Carlos “Beto” Sicupira and Marcel Herrmann Telles in 2004, making highly lucrative and long-hold investments into food and beverage companies like Anheuser-Busch, H.J. Heinz & Company and Burger King. In recent years, the firm has ventured into other industries, including a 75% stake in Dutch window blinds maker Hunter Douglas. The inheritance saga plaguing the widow and children of Joseph Safra, once the richest banker in the world, has come to an end. "I am happy to put that matter behind. After clarifications, I understood that there were no wrongdoings, and that Mr. Safra's estate was properly disposed in accordance to his wishes,” son Alberto said in a joint statement with the family released in July. Alberto had previously sued his mother and siblings, claiming his stake in Safra National Bank of New York had been diluted after his father's passing. The widow of Andrónico Luksic (d. 2005) and his children are reportedly seeking nearly $230 million from Banco Santander and PwC related to losses from Banco Popular’s near-bankruptcy in 2017. Through Aeris Invest, the family had put around $125 million into Banco Popular shortly before Santander acquired it for just one euro after it was declared failing by the European Central Bank. Larrea built his fortune by expanding Grupo Mexico into a conglomerate with interests in transportation and infrastructure. The mining mogul, who took over as president and CEO in 1994, is one of only three Mexicans whose fortunes are up this year as the conglomerate’s revenue rose by nearly 13%, to $16.2 billion. Grupo Mexico’s mining division reported record revenues thanks to higher copper production and strong market conditions. Bryan van der Beek for Forbes The Facebook cofounder continues to reap the benefits of his Meta stake. Saverin’s wealth has increased by $6.5 billion as Meta’s stock continues to surge. Saverin, who resides in Singapore, topped Forbes’ Singapore’s 50 Richest list in September. Three months later, he and his wife donated $15 million to the Singapore American School. Martin Schoeller for Forbes Although he’s still among the world’s top 20 richest people, Slim’s drop to No. 19 overall marks the lowest he’s ranked since 2003. While shares of his biggest companies, América Móvil and Grupo Carso, were down over the past year, the telecommunications magnate has poured $1 billion into U.S. oil companies Talos Energy and PBF Energy.

Title: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Market Value Craters $20 Billion On March 27 After Muddy Waters Takes Aim, Class Action Pending – Hagens Berman

March 31, 2025 19:28 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, March 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On March 27, 2025, investors in AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) saw the price of their shares drop $65.92, wiping out about $20 billion of the company’s market value, after prominent short seller Muddy Waters Research revealed its short position in the stock. Muddy Waters’ report comes on the heels of a recently filed securities class action lawsuit, captioned Quiero v. AppLovin Corporation, et al., No. 4:25-cv-02294 (N.D. Cal.). The suit seeks to represent investors who purchased AppLovin securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Hagens Berman is investigating the claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com | 844-916-0895 Recent Development: On March 27, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a scathing report titled “AppLovin: Deep Data Analysis Shows APP is Just Another Scammy AdTech Company.” The report’s focus is in part on “retargeting” (a strategy that aims to re-engage potential customers who have previously interacted with a brand), “incrementality” (the additional or incremental lift in sales or conversions that a marketing activity generates), and AppLovin’s compliance with third party platforms’ TOS (terms of service). Muddy Waters contends that “APP e-commerce is Mostly Retargeting, Incrementality is Low, and it Clearly Violates Platforms’ TOS.” Muddy Waters alleges that: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Securities Class Action: The Muddy Waters report follows the filing of a securities class action complaint alleging AppLovin made false and misleading statements, while failing to disclose critical details about its flagship AXON 2.0 digital advertising platform. The company had heavily promoted the platform as "the best and fastest-growing product we’ve ever released." Investors were allegedly led to believe that the platform, which reportedly leverages “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would redefine the digital advertising landscape by enhancing ad placement efficiency and expanding into e-commerce and web-based marketing. However, the alleged narrative first shifted on February 26, 2025, when short sellers Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research published damaging reports that raised pointed questions about the company’s claims. Both research firms accused AppLovin of misleading investors regarding the platform's true capabilities and ethical practices. Fuzzy Panda Research alleged that the company violated app store policies by exploiting user data in questionable ways, predicting that tech giants Apple and Google would ban AppLovin from their app stores. Additionally, they accused AppLovin of “stealing data from Meta” as part of its e-commerce initiatives, foreseeing swift retaliation from Meta. Culper Research criticized the company for allegedly using AXON 2.0 as little more than a promotional facade to obscure the real drivers behind its business strategy. Culper's report further claimed that AppLovin's growth in mobile gaming has relied on “systematic exploitation of app permissions that enable advertisements themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations onto users’ phones, with just a single click – an event that is often inadvertent thanks to the Company’s notorious UX gimmicks” and that “each illicit install translates directly to profit.” “We are investigating claims that AppLovin may have misled investors about whether its growth may be attributable to illegitimate conduct,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: YouTube’s Revenue Will Top Disney’s This Year As It Becomes “The Home For All Things Video”, Analyst Says

By Dade Hayes Business Editor YouTube‘s revenue will surpass Disney‘s this year, making it the top global player in media, according to a report by veteran Wall Street analyst Michael Nathanson. With $54.2 billion in revenue last year, the company is on pace to become No. 1 by the end of 2025, he predicts in a new report issued Monday. Because of its massive viewing, which has twice eclipsed that for Disney and other media giants according to Nielsen, the valuation for the former black sheep has continued moving skyward. “If YouTube was a standalone business, public comps suggest the business would be worth $475 to $550 billion, or about 30% of Alphabet’s current valuation,” wrote Nathanson, a partner in MoffettNathanson, in his annual report on YouTube, which anoints the company “king of all media.” (The value of Netflix and Meta Platforms, for comparison, are in a similar neighborhood.) Related Stories News 'Zootopia 2' Charms CinemaCon As Ke Huy Quan Intros Scenes Of Judy Hopps & Nick Wilde In Therapy With Quinta Brunson's Dr. Fuzzby News Zoe Saldaña Shows Off 'Avatar: Fire And Ash' At Disney's CinemaCon Despite his rhapsody about YouTube’s scale, growth and potential, Nathanson in the report actually lowered his 12-month price target on parent Alphabet’s shares by $10, putting it at $210. He reiterated the firm’s “buy” rating on the stock, however. Watch on Deadline Nathanson believes YouTube is just coming into its own as a seller of advertising in the living room. While the company has long touted growth of viewing of its content via a TV screen, confirming last month that it now has surpassed mobile, the ad marketplace is still catching up. Entrenched streaming ad purveyor Pluto is able to charge about 26 cents per hour of viewing, while YouTube is at about 18 cents, Nathanson estimates. “Given YouTube’s scaled reach and data advantage over other AVOD/FAST platforms, we believe YouTube is under-monetizing its engagement today and instead should be in a league of its own ahead of this comp group,” ahead of Tubi, Roku Channel and Pluto, the analyst writes. In addition to ad revenue upside, Nathanson continues, “YouTube is also positioned to become the home for all things video.” That projection is based on the company’s dominance across “three key buckets.” The report defines them as YouTube Premium & Music; YouTube TV, where the company recently surpassed 8 million subscribers, and “Other.” That last bucket includes YouTube Primetime Channels (including NFL Sunday Ticket), channel memberships, VOD, and creator monetization tools throwing off a share of proceeds to YouTube.

Title: Stocks close out their worst quarter since 2022 amid tariff uncertainty
URL: https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/stocks-close-worst-quarter-2022-tariff-uncertainty-rcna198956
Time Published: 2025-03-31T21:25:21Z
Full Content:
Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Two of the three major U.S. stock indexes just wrapped up their worst quarter in well over two years. The third barely avoided the same fate. The S&P 500 dropped more than 4.5% for the first quarter of 2025 as of Monday’s close, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted 10.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average settled 1.3% lower and recorded its first back-to-back monthly loss since October 2023. The declines on all three indexes come days before President Donald Trump is set to unveil a new slate of wide-ranging tariffs, extending ongoing trade policy turmoil that has kept investors guessing for months. The broad-based S&P 500 fell briefly into correction territory Monday, meaning a 10% slide from its last high. The index regained some ground late in the day, but not enough to dodge its worst monthly percentage drop since December 2022. The index’s first-quarter stumbles ended a streak of five straight winning quarters, while the Nasdaq wiped out more than half of last year’s gains over the last three months. Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta, known on Wall Street as the “magnificent 7,” have lost more than $2 trillion in market value collectively since the start of the year. The last time U.S. markets stumbled as badly was in the middle of 2022 after Russia’s late-February invasion of Ukraine, shocking the global economy as Western nations hit Moscow with severe sanctions and commodities like oil and grains shot up in price. The first quarter of this year saw geopolitical upheaval of a different sort, as investors have struggled to digest the series of major U.S. policy changes since Inauguration Day. The quarter marked the S&P’s worst performance versus the rest of the world since 1980, according to Dow Jones — at a time when a number of foreign stock markets have surged. The Euro Stoxx 600 index, which tracks companies across 17 countries, has risen 5% to start the year as the S&P 500 dropped by roughly the same amount. In fact, the Stoxx 600 has just had its best quarter against the S&P since 2015, according to FactSet data. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 also rose more than 5% in the same period. The MSCI China index, a benchmark of 580 Chinese stocks, ended the first quarter up 16%. Markets overseas have popped for a range of reasons, with some but not all related to the Trump administration’s actions. The European Union and U.K. have taken steps to trim regulations and hike military spending in response to White House moves, boosting shares of defense companies in both places and helping power markets there overall. In China, the strong performance has been more a reflection of local factors, including economic stimulus and enthusiasm around home-grown AI startups. It’s not a rosy picture everywhere, though. Japan’s flagship stock index sank 10% in the first quarter over fears about slowing manufacturing and an export economy that could be hurt by Trump’s still-expanding tariff agenda. The president is set to open another front in his trade war Wednesday, a date he has dubbed America’s “Liberation Day” from the purported abuses of its top trading partners, many of them longtime allies. Trump has vowed so-called reciprocal tariffs aimed at equalizing trade barriers between the U.S. and a number of countries that sell to Americans more of their own goods and services than those they buy from the U.S. But with the details of this policy program still up in the air days before it’s set to roll out, business leaders and consumers have been grappling with widespread uncertainty over the coming impact. Nearly 900 nonfinancial companies mentioned tariffs on recent earnings calls, S&P Global Market Intelligence said this month. “This is truly ridiculous,” one manufacturing executive said in an anonymous Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas survey published Monday. “I have been in business for 50 years as of next year, and never have I seen such uncertainty in the market. It is very difficult to plan and make decisions.” But things could still turn around in the months ahead, some analysts say. “Once tariffs are announced on April 2, negotiations to soften them can begin,” researchers at the investment bank UBS said in a note to clients Monday. “Progress toward a budget reconciliation bill could refocus attention on market-positive aspects of the Trump agenda.” Steve Kopack is a producer at NBC News covering business and the economy. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Does CoreWeave's disappointing IPO signal an AI bubble?
URL: https://qz.com/coreweave-ipo-ai-bubble-1851773579
Time Published: 2025-03-31T19:29:00Z

New Jersey-based AI and cloud computing company CoreWeave made its market debut on Friday to little applause. The stock was poised for success by all means: It was the biggest tech IPO since software company UiPath (PATH-2.42%) in 2021, and a rare IPO of a pure-play AI company. Plus, it was backed by market-favorite tech giant Nvidia (NVDA-7.40%), which ended up having to anchor the IPO last minute with a $250 million order. But things didn’t pan out as expected. The company had initially targeted a $2.7 billion raise but ended up coming in at $1.5 billion instead. The shares priced at $40, well below the $47 to $50 price range expected previously, and started trading on Friday at $39. On Monday, the stock’s second day of trading, the shares were down almost 10% in midday trading. CoreWeave is a cloud computing company that provides GPU infrastructure to major tech names like Microsoft (MSFT-3.09%) and Meta (META-4.44%). The company primarily uses Nvidia’s GPUs to run these data centers. Due to the costly nature of the business, CoreWeave relies on accumulating debt to build its capacity, relying on future demand for AI computing power. CoreWeave is considered a pure-play AI company because the company’s success bets directly on the future of AI demand growth. Most pure-play AI companies — like OpenAI, which kicked off the AI craze in 2022 with ChatGPT — are privately held and don’t publicly disclose finances, which makes it tough for investors to have a gauge on the industry as a whole. CoreWeave’s market debut was seen by many as a way to understand how the AI trade was going amidst rising fears of an AI bubble. Some industry experts think the stock’s disappointing IPO should be an indicator that the hype is subsiding. “[If] a year ago CoreWeave had gone public, the words ‘AI’ and ‘Nvidia’ would have been enough to carry it over the line. The fact that it’s not able to do it now is an indicator that the momentum of just trading based on the words AI or Nvidia are not working anymore,” NYU Stern School of Business professor of finance Aswath Damodaran told CNBC last week, adding that he thinks that’s healthy and that AI has been hyped a bit too much. “The AI product and service business, which ultimately is what has to pay for all of this, has not taken off in any substantial way. I mean, I’m hard pressed to think about any company making significant money from the AI product and service business,” Damodaran said. For its part, OpenAI expects revenue to more than triple by the end of this year, according to revenue expectations reported by Bloomberg last week, but the company doesn’t anticipate to be cash-flow positive until 2029. Market skepticism of the AI trade began late last year, Damodaran said, and accelerated when Chinese AI startup DeepSeek rattled markets by unveiling a reasoning model that rivaled OpenAI’s for less cost and energy earlier this year. What happened last week with the CoreWeave IPO, Damodaran says, is the market recognizing that “too much money” has been spent “too far in advance of the actual evidence that the market exists.” “I think we’re at that moment in the AI business where we’re looking for some evidence that AI product and service business will be trillions of dollars rather than hundreds of millions of dollars,” he said. Not all experts agree that the IPO’s disappointment has a direct correlation with the power of the AI trade, though. “While the CoreWeave IPO clearly did not go well, it should not be taken as an indication of the strength of the market for AI,” D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Quartz. Luria thinks that CoreWeave is “a little more than a highly leveraged off balance sheet arrangement for Nvidia,” pointing to Nvidia’s decision to bail out the company’s IPO. CoreWeave’s leveraged spending helps fuel Nvidia’s GPU sales without putting any direct financial risk on Nvidia. In an initiation note last week, Luria said CoreWeave’s debt-based business model can only be sustainable as long as demand for AI grows “faster than hyperscalers are able to build data centers,” making CoreWeave a risky investment as is. Regarding speculations of whether or not AI is in a bubble, Luria makes an analogy to the 2008 financial crisis, in which collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) — particularly, subprime mortgages — played a huge role in creating a housing bubble. “If AI was a CDO, we see CoreWeave as the sub-prime tranche,” Luria wrote. D.A. Davidson currently has a neutral rating on the stock. “The importance of AI to the future path of technology transcends any one company, and is definitely bigger than CoreWeave,” Luria told Quartz.

Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce.
