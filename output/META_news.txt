It is all here: Financial, economic independence, liberation: MSTU—> 2x levered long MSTR, REX Shares, trustworthy as the CEO did a live interview with Saylor on BMAX, … which holds corporate Bitcoin backed bonds ,,, mostly Strategy. So,,, if bitcoin goes up 5% in a day, Strategy will go up 10%, then MSTU (2x MSTR) will go up 20%—> simple math! Buy bitcoin with Coinbase, mortgage as much of it as you can, use the cash, to buy MSTR and or MSTU (2x levered long MSTR, which is essentially 4x bitcoin). You can then: Once JPMORGAN Chase starts offering you the chance to buy bitcoin with them and or to custody it with them, then you know you’ve arrived! Introduction to Bitcoin Lecture Video Super pumped to share with you, my first full length lecture on an introduction to bitcoin, the bitcoin Revolution, and also this edited transcript that I provided for you! STOIC VLOG Something I have been meaning to write or create or do is like some sort of book, ebook, pamphlet, or introductory primer to stoicism. I really think that stoicism is probably one of the most useful and philosophical models to live normal every day real life. Yet, I haven’t really found a good instructional guide on it, especially when I was self teaching it to myself. Consider this a practical primer, cutting through the BS: Stoicism, stoic, the stoa in ancient Greece– essentially the stoa was like some sort of portico, patio, pillar, outside, essentially a spot where guys would just hang out, talk shop, talk philosophy, etc. ￼ ￼ I think about the show “Hey Arnold” in which I was raised with… the notion of “stoop kid“, the notion of a stoop is that in a lot of cities, especially the east coast in New York, you have this little stoop or porch, stairs that go outside your front door… and you could just hang out there, engage in social and neighborhood life etc. One of my happiest moments was when I was living in Providence Rhode Island, and then COVID-19 hit. Everything was closed, besides the park. I can still go to the park, hang out, workout, do chin ups– I learned how to do muscle ups, more bodyweight calisthenics stuff, and also… I had a lot of fun with this “rock toss“ challenge and workout… in the middle of the park was a huge ass rock and huge ass stone, and every single day I would go there pick it up, and then eventually work out with it; throwing it around for fun, doing overhead presses with it, clean and jerks, squats, and eventually I would just throw it around for fun. Funny enough it might have been the most fit I was in my life… this was the true “functional” fitness. The inspiration — Hector lifting an insanely massive stone (barely 2 strong men could lift it)… using it to break down the door of the ships of the other side. Anyways, the reason why that period of covid was so good is that it was in the middle of beautiful Providence Rhode Island summer, so nice and bright and warm and lovely… and one of the good things was going to the park was like an open forum, a new anatheum for a lot of really cool guys to come, hang out, talk shop, go topless and shirtless, workout and hang out. I met some really interesting people during that period of time. I met some guys who were really cool. For example, one guy I met was in the US military Navy, I think he was training to be a Navy seal or Delta force or something. Another guy in some sort of ROTC training, another cool guy from the hood, and also I would say I probably met half a dozen friendly drug dealers there. And of course a lot of people who believed in conspiracy theories; really friendly, a little weird, but overall good guys. Anyways, one of the biggest benefits of hanging out at that outdoor park, open air, nothing but green grass, the beautiful sun and the fitness equipment was that I think having this sort of open air environment is actually very conducive to socializing, thinking and thought, and pro social behavior. My theory about a lot of modern day antisocial behavior has to do with the structures which enclose us. For example, almost universally most guys at the gym are extremely antisocial. Why? My theory is that because most gyms have closed, cramped narrow ceilings, and do not have access to natural light, or outside space. Cramped indoor spaces promote antisocial behavior. The only good gym I went to which was interesting was the golds gym in Venice, which has this really big outdoor workout area. I think this is much more natural and more fun and better; to be able to work out directly outside outdoors, with your shirt off. Stoics, stoicism — it was originally I think codified by this guy named Zeno, and over time he picked up some followers. Essentially the whole thing happened organically; Zeno would first share his thinking on philosophy ethics and pragmatic ways to deal with other people and the downsides of life, he built a following, and then his followers would propagate the thoughts and start their own little schools of thoughts, their own little stoic clubs. Would I like about stoicism is how loosey goosey it is. It is kind of like zen, or taoism… it is not really quantified as a religion, or a strict moral order. In fact, a lot of the ancients stoics would meditate on random stuff like cosmology, natural sciences like Seneca, how volcanoes worked or whatever. I think nowadays in today’s world, we focus primarily on the pragmatic side; how to deal with fear, uncertainty, downsides etc. ￼I think I might’ve first learned about stoicism from Nassim Taleb and his ANTIFRAGILE book. I was curious, and my curiosity went to deep. To quote NASSIM TALEB and the Venetian saying “The ocean goes deeper, the deeper you wade into it.” I literally consumed every single book I could find on stoicism, even the obscure ones. Funny enough, a lot of the stoic thinkers tried to claim other philosophers as being stoic, like Seneca did with Diogenes the cynic. ￼ Cynic, cynicism, actually comes from the word canine, the dog. Diogenes was considered the “dog” philosopher, first used as a pejorative, but ultimately Diogenes reappropriated that title for fun! He saw dogs as tough, almost like wild wolves, rather than seeing them as a negative thing. Even Achilles when he was raging against king Agamemnon, he called him “dog faced“ as a heaping insult. First, Seneca. Seneca the younger, his dad was called Seneca the elder. In fact, this is such a big deal because Cindy and I named our first son, Seneca, directly after the stoic philosopher. This is true soul in the game; if you name your kid after your favorite philosopher, certainly it is a sign that you really liked that philosopher, or found them impactful. ￼￼￼The reason why I really like Seneca the stoic philosopher is because he had real connections to real reality. What that means is he wasn’t just on the sidelines; he actually existed in the real world, engaged in real politics, was even advisor to the emperor Nero, the bad one, who eventually low-key coerced Seneca to commit suicide, in a manly, dignified manner. I think this was because maybe… there was actually a plan to overthrow Nero, and essentially Nero found out. ￼ I really like Seneca because his writing is accessible, practical and pragmatic, and interesting. A lot of thinkers tend to lack connections to real reality, I have no tolerance for boring philosophers to talk about metaphysics, which is things which are not physical. Like thoughts ideas, the universe, electricity and energy, strange phenomenon and conspiracy theories on ghosts, “energy” whatever. ￼￼For a long time, I would hear the term “metaphysics” being thrown around, and I had zero idea what it actually meant. ￼ Meta– on top of. Or nestled within. Physics — the physical, physical phenomenon like gravity, first principles. The reason why metaphysics philosophers tend to be a bunch of losers is that they are all weak and anemic, nerds or geeks or weaklings who seem to have some sort of physiological degeneracy, which encourages them to opine or talk or think about impractical things, superficial things. Personally speaking, I think philosophy must be practical. ￼￼￼￼ Practical, praxis, ￼practice — to do! I have a very funny ideal; the general idea is that your body looks like a demigod, and your physiology is out of control. The general idea is one must be tall, strong, highly muscular, low body fat percentage, I’m not exactly sure what my body fat percentage is, but maybe it’s around 5%. ￼￼Also, physical fitness is critical to any stoic. My ideal is to walk 50 miles a day, eat 20 pounds of meat like Milo of Croton a day. And also, abstinence from silly things like media, alcohol, drugs, marijuana etc. Trust no thinker who does drugs! Even our best friend Nietzsche said that coffee was bad, because it would make people dark and gloomy. He encouraged 100% cocoa powder instead. ￼￼￼ Simple technique: First, look at a picture or a portrait or a full body shot, ideally topless of the artist, philosopher or thinker or individual… then judge their thoughts later. Why? My theory is this: the thoughts of an individual is hugely affected by their bodily physiology. For example, an extreme example: if somebody is locked inside a solitary confinement cell, and not permitted to go outside for years, but, he had a pen and pad and would jot down some thoughts… Would be the quality of these thoughts? Certainly dark and morose. In today’s world, why does it matter, what is the significance of stoicism, etc.? First and foremost, I think we are living in a troubling time, especially with the advent of modern day internet based media and advertising. I think 99% of what is propagated on the internet is fear mongering, and what is hate? Hate is just fear. The first thought on stoicism is that it is just fear conquering. What I discovered about street photography, is that 99% of it is conquering your fears. Conquering your fears of upsetting other people, getting in some sort of verbal or physical altercation etc. In fact my bread and butter workshop is my conquering your fears and street photography workshop, the workshop which is still interesting to me even after a decade. Why is this so important? I think it is rooted in almost everything; conquering your fears is rooted in entrepreneurship, innovation, risktaking and real life. Even my speculation in crypto. 99.9% of crypto speculation is just balls. Having the balls to make big bets, and when things go south, knowing how to master your emotions. A simple extra I have is this: just imagine it will all go down to zero. It was useful because when I was in college, my sophomore year I got really into trading stocks, and I eventually lost my whole life savings, maybe around $3500 USD, and some bad penny stock which I actually misread the financials… the whole time I thought the company was making a profit, but actually it was taking a loss. I actually didn’t know that if profits are written in parentheses, it means a loss. It was funny because my initial start as an investor was back in high school, I bought some Adobe stock when I was a high school junior, and also some mutual funds, which both went up after about 4-5 years. ￼Also I remember in elementary school computer class, when I was in the sixth grade in Bayside Queens, there was some sort of stock stimulation trading game, and actually it was funny… the kids who made the most money and were the most successful just put 100% of everything into Apple, note this is when we were only 12 years old, and I was born in 1988. ￼Funny enough, it seems that stoicism actually plays well with capitalism. Why? According to modern day capitalist thinking, the best way to approach life is to be objective, strong, stoic, unemotional, logical and rational. Also, ￼with modern day media there is so much fear mongering in the news, about some sort of global armageddon, global financial ruin, etc. I call it “fear porn”. Therefore stoicism as a mindset is useful to think and position your mind in such a way that you could consider that life is all upside, no downside. In fact, if I could summarize stoicism in one sentence, it is that life is all upside, no downside. Inspired by NASSIM TALEB. So, is stoicism useful to you if you’re a man or a woman? Does it matter? The good thing is I think it could apply to both sexes. Conquering sexism and social pressures is useful if you’re woman, and also if you’re a man. Also, gender is social. Lot of the expectations set on us by society is socialized and gamed to a certain degree. First, we got to unchain ourselves from modern day ethics and morality. I believe that all modern day philosophy and thinking and ethics and religion is bad. For example, the notion of turning the other cheek is a patently bad one. Why did Jesus turn his cheek? It is because he lacked on army. Also, philosophically I think we should put no trust in Socrates. ￼￼￼I thought which has puzzled me for a long time was this “Why was Socrates so ugly? Monster in face, monster in soul. I think Socrates was a degenerate, and he lacked any sort of real power. Therefore he turned logic and rationality into his terrorizing weapon (via Nietzsche). Back in the day, you didn’t need logic or rationality to have things your way, you simply was able to dictate that which you wanted to pause it, because you had a military force behind you. Just think about Machiavelli and IL PRINCIPE– the reality of being a mercurial prince, king, and military leader is hard, stoic, “immoral”. But ultimately it all comes down to war, conquest, the military. Trust nobody who uses rationality or logic as their tyrannizing weapon. ￼ In fact, I believe that all should have the body and strength of some sort of super soldier. Essentially look like all the guys from the movie 300, this is our ideal. Demigod physique. ￼ And this is the true courage of Kanye West; he literally put everything on the line, and even lost his spouse and I think maybe his kids? All for the sake of revealing inequities. ￼ “I throw these Maybach keys fucking c’est la ￼vie! I know that we the new slaves.”￼- Ye The fun thing about stoicism is that you could just make it up as you go, devise your own strategies and whatever. “Fucking c’est la vie!” My favorite Kanye West line. Essentially the general idea is that in life, one should not take things too seriously. Laughter is golden, I forget the philosopher who was called the laughing philosopher… Democritus?; better to laugh about the follies of human beings rather than to be dark and morose about it. Also, thoughts from the Odyssey; if you look far enough ￼ into the future, everything becomes comedic and hilarious. So when you’re in some sort of bad situation, just think to yourself “Perhaps one day, 20 or 30 years from now… I will look back at this and just laugh!” It will just be humorous. Honestly, laughter, and kind of being able to joke about things might be the best way to live life and deal with setbacks. ￼ Problems in modern day life: A funny thing I have learned is that when you call something something, it isn’t that. For example, if someone calls something a “luxury car”, it ain’t. For example, a true modern day luxury car is maybe a Tesla, but Tesla never calls itself a luxury car. Also the ultimate luxury technology company is probably Apple… but Apple is very intelligent and not calling themselves a luxury brand. A pro tip is when it comes to websites, read the alternative text, the header text, the stuff that shows up in the tab of your browser window. If the website, the automotive retailer tries to market themselves as a “luxury” brand, typically it is actually a sign that it isn’t a luxury brand it isn’t luxury brand. Thought: what are some good examples of true luxury brands which don’t overly calls itself luxury? ￼￼ In someways, we can think and consider stoicism as our new luxury. In fact, having luxury, luxury of mind and soul… and luxury of freedom of speech, isn’t this the ultimate luxury? When somebody asked Diogenes the cynic; “What is the best human good”? He said “Freedom of speech, speaking your mind, having the power to see whatever is on your mind.” In fact, my current joy is becoming more and more free talking, and free riding. What that means is this; I’m ain’t going to censor myself no more, even if I might be politically incorrect insensitive or whatever. ￼ Also, I would prefer to speak my mind and seriously hurt the feelings of others, rather than soften it for the sake of the other person. ￼￼￼Similarly speaking, when people call themselves “influencers”, they are not influencers. Ultimately I think we should think of stoicism just like having another tool inside our tool kit. For example, if you’re a chef, you’re going to have different knives for different purposes. If you’re going to cut a big piece of meat, you probably want a big ass meat cutting knife, not something you would use to slice an apple with. Similarly speaking, if you’re going to scoop out the insides of an avocado, better to use a spoon rather than using a fork, or a knife. ￼ I think the problem is when some people get too into stoicism (I prefer writing stoicism with a lowercase￼), they think that everything needs to be consistent, and must fit into this nice little neat box of what is considered “stoicism“. This is a bad line of thinking… let us consider that Marcus Aurelius never even mentioned stoicism in his writings, his collections of thoughts, which we moderns call THE MEDITATIONS… it was just essentially his personal diary, to help him conquer his own personal fears and thoughts, I don’t think he ever intended it to be published publicly. I think he just wrote it to himself as self therapy. And I think the only stoic philosopher he even mentions is maybe Epictetus. For myself, I just come out with certain to work out thoughts and techniques because it helps me, and when I find these tricks or techniques or secret hacks or cheat codes… My passion is to simply share it with others. ￼￼￼￼ And ultimately, things are ever in flux and evolving and changing and adapting. For example, I’ve discovered the quality of my thinking is different when I am in Culver City Los Angeles, compared to being in the boring suburbs of Orange County. Also depending on my social environments… my stoic thoughts are different when I am in a gym, vs just working out by myself in my parking spot in the back of my apartment. Also, the quality of my thoughts is different when living with family members or other people versus just living with myself Cindy and Seneca. Assuming you’re not growing your own vegetables and living in the middle of nowhere… you probably have some interaction with other human beings. As long as you have an iPhone, an Android phone, a smartphone, a 4G or 5G internet connection, wifi, a laptop, have to buy groceries somewhere… you’re still going to have to interact with other human beings. And this is good. There is no other greater joy than other human beings. In fact, modern-day society is strange because in someways, the ethos is to be antisocial and to be cowardly. But in fact, the best way to think about things is that real life is interaction with other human beings, and social conquest. One can imagine a lot of modern day entrepreneurship as simply a big dick swinging contest. He who is the most masculine confident tall and strong and stoic shall win. Assume that everyone is mentally insane: Have you ever been out in public, and you see some sort of crackhead or strange homeless person who acts radically, smells terrible, and is obviously mentally ill? Do you hate them for it? When they say something weird to you… do you take it personally? No. Why? They are crazy. Perhaps we should just adopt this stoic mindset towards other people; some people are actually physiologically ill, mentally unwell… don’t trust the opinion of nobody. A lot of people are trying to actually deal with their own inner demons: For example, becoming the successful photographer and street photographer I am today… I’ve dealt with some individuals who would say anonymous bad things about me, and later I found out that their mom just died or something. I cannot imagine what it feels like losing a mother… therefore if somebody spew some hate on me because something bad happened to them, I’m not gonna take it personally. ￼￼￼￼￼Self-flagellation: I think a lot of people who are sick, mentally or physiologically self flagellate themselves. Essentially the way that they deal with other people or themselves is some sort of metaphorical self-flagellation. For example… you know those strange individuals who have the whip and whip themselves, and inflict pain on themselves? I think some people do this metaphorically to themselves and others. You just want to stay away from them. My personal theory on fear is that a lot of it is tied to morality and ethics. I think the general idea is not necessarily that we are afraid of anything… I think the true fear is that we’re afraid that we are some sort of bad evil unethical immoral person. For example in street photography, the general ethical thought is that it is immoral to take a photo of somebody without their permission, because there is some sort of it inherent evil behind it. Is this true? No. Taking photos and not really a big deal. I think it is because some people are just overly sensitive, which once again comes from some sort of physiological weakness. For example, if you’re a weightlifter who could lift 1000 pounds, assuming you’re not taking any steroids or anything… are small things going to bother you? No. But let us assume that you are a skinny fat man, all you do is drink alcohol and smoke marijuana and watch Netflix, and you spent too much time on Reddit… you are 40% body fat, and have never lifted in your life. And also your testosterone is low and you never go outside. Certainly the quality of your thoughts is going to be different than if you’re a happy gay monster, lifting weights outside in the direct sun, laughing and having fun. ￼￼￼ In fact, I’ve actually personally discovered that the reason why a lot of people hate me is because I am so happy jovial and gay. They are secretly suspicious or envious of me? ￼ Probably one of my worst experiences was this jarring transition; I was super happy insanely happy being in Vietnam in 2017; with a beautiful weather, the beautiful light, the happy people the great amenities etc.… and then that winter Cindy and I went to Europe, in Marseille Berlin and Prague, and maybe London… seriously the worst winter of my life. Why? I wonder if so much miserable feelings and thoughts simply comes from the darkness and lack of light. a lot of Europe is actually quite miserable; dark, unhygienic, morose. Even Nietzsche had a thought about Schopenhauer; How much of these emo European philosophers came from the fact that it was just complaining about the cold weather in Germany etc.?￼￼For myself, my ideal weather is Southeast Asia; I love being in Phnom Penh Cambodia, Vietnam etc. In the states, am I the only one who loves living in Los Angeles? Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar said that LA was the best for women weed and weather… I would definitely say the biggest upside of living in Los Angeles is the light, the sunlight. It actually does get quite cold here, but usually most reliably even in December during the winter time, the sun will always come up. As long as there is bright sunny light, I will be happy. And I think maybe for myself, considering that I am a photographer, and photography means painting with light… light for me is critical. I also wonder how much of it is a physiological thing and a genetic trait; for example I could even recall being a young child, and my mom telling me that the most critical thing in finding a home or an apartment was light and natural light. Even now… 90% of my happiness comes from being able to ￼have access to natural light, ideally floor to ceiling windows facing directly the sun, having some sort of modern temperature regulated apartment and home. Even living in our tiny studio minimalistic luxury apartment in Providence Rhode Island, where it was always 75° warm and cozy, and not frigid and damp and cold and dark and humid… I was always good. But moving to an older house, where it always felt damp and cold… this literally lowered my happiness by 1000%. Therefore, if you’re feeling miserable sad or whatever… I say spend three months living in Hanoi or Saigon in Vietnam, or go to Phnom Penh Cambodia. I wonder if 90% of peoples misery is simply due to the weather. ￼￼”Better to be a gay monster than a sentimental bore!” – Fernandino Galliani, via Nietzsche My stoic ideal is somebody who is happy, gay, smiling, no headphones or AirPods on, no sunglasses on, no hat, no facial hair, no baggy oversized clothing, no tint in their car. Somebody who makes great eye contact, laughs, stands up upright, jokes, and fools around. Like an overgrown child. ￼Also, lift weights at least once every day, ideally in the direct sun. Just buy some weightlifting equipment on Titan.fitness, I like the farmers carry handles, the Olympic loadable dumbbell, and also the Texas power squat bar. Just buy some cheap weights, and or buy a heavy 400 pound sandbag, and just have fun throwing it around. A true stoic should look something like Hercules or Achilles. Or like ERIC KIM; I have the aesthetic and the physique of Brad Pitt in FIGHT CLUB except with a lot more muscle. Like my friend Soren says, the Adonis physique and proportions. I think a real stoic is sexy, happy and fun. Who doesn’t take life too seriously; and think of everything like a fun game. A real stoic would be joyful and cheery like three-year-old child without any adulteration from the outside world. I don’t like talking with or hanging out with adults, uninteresting. At what point or age do people become so emo? Typically, highschoolers are very optimistic. Even college students. But I think at least in maybe college in high school nowadays… the bad trend is towards “over concern”, about the world the planet ethics animals etc. I find a lot of this thinking superficial, performative, and uncritical. I think “animal rights“, “saving the planet” is this new pseudo world religion; which is just capitalism 3.0. I find the whole pet industry the whole dog industry to be insanely bizarre, and I trust nobody who talks about “saving the planet“ who owns an iPhone, owns any sort of car, or has an Amazon prime subscription. Certainly not any vegans. Animals are animals. They are lower on the hierarchy and totem pole on earth. Man is the apex predator, the apex bully and the apex tyrant. Should we care for animals or “animal rights”? No. Animals are our slaves. If you consider even dogs and pets… they are essentially our emotional slaves. People talk a lot about the virtuosity of dogs being loyal or whatever… and giving you unconditional love. This seems like some sort of emotional slavery. The only dogs I respect are some sort of canine dogs, some sort of attack or defense dogs, or hunting dogs. For example, John Wick 3; Halle Barry and her dogs. An animal should either be a weapon, or nothing. Essentially it looks like men no longer have a backbone. No more spine. I trust nobody who owns a dog. Let us not forget; they call it dog ownership, or “owning a pet”. There is no more concept of “human ownership, or “owning a human.”￼￼￼ What is the end goal of humanity? To me it is towards entrepreneurship, innovation, art and aesthetics, philosophy etc. Design. Stoicism should be considered a tool which could aid you in these things. For example, I think 99% of entrepreneurship is courage. Stoicism could help you with that. I also think with design, great design is also 99% courage, having the courage to attempt something that won’t sell or be received well… stoicism is all about practical courage. The only designers with courage include Steve Jobs, Jony Ive, Elon Musk, Kanye West. ￼ Also, weightlifting. To attempt to lift a certain weight you have never attempted before takes great courage. For example, me atlas lifting 1000 pounds; that is 10 plates and a 25 on each side, ￼￼￼this is true stoic training. Why? The fear of injury is what holds most people back; if you had successfully conquered this fear and not injured yourself, this is pure stoic bliss. I think the only and the only proper way to lift weights is one repetition maximum training. That is; what is the maximum amount of weight you’re able to successfully lift or move, even half an inch? To me, the courage is the success. Even if you had the courage to attempt it… that is what is considered success. ￼￼ Simple exercises to do include the atlas lift, innovated by ERIC KIM, or a one repetition max rack pull. Or, a high trap bar deadlift, heavy Farmer’s walks, or heavy sandbag carries. Or even a simple thing you could do is go to the park or to the local nature center, find the biggest rock there and just see if you could pick it up. If you’re interested in stoicism, and have had some interesting thoughts on stoicism, one of the most noble things you could do is start your own blog. I think blogs are 1000 times more effective than publishing some sort of static printed book; I think the problem in today’s world is that everyone is seeking some sort of legitimacy by being picked up by some sort of legitimate publisher and getting “published“, and seeing your printed book at Barnes & Noble whatever. I say it is better to be open source, free and permissionless, ￼￼￼decentralized. Just publish your thoughts and book as a free PDF, and just host it on dropbox, Google Drive, or your own web server. Share the link freely, and also just publish the raw text as a big blog post. ￼ Even Sam Bankman-Fried wisely thought; 99.9% of books could just be summarized as big blog posts. Don’t trust any modern day published book which isn’t free, because… there is some sort of hidden clout chasing somewhere. ￼ Even one of the worst compromises that led to the demise of Ray Dalio was the fact that he took his Principles book, which was essentially a free ebook PDF on his website, and then took it off, because I think he got a book deal with Simon and Schuster. After he did that, he lost my respect. If you’re already independently wealthy, and you don’t crowd source your self-esteem… why would you need to externally validate yourself by getting some sort of constipated publisher and annoying editor? Editors are bad. Start your own blog and start blogging your own thoughts on stoic philosophy, and even start a YouTube channel and start vlogging on it. ￼￼My generalized thought is simple: if your thought your idea your blog post your video or whatever could even impact the life of one other human being on planet earth… it is worth it. ERIC What is the secret to the maximum amount of happiness in life? The maximum amount of danger. (Nietzsche).

Tesla (TSLA-3.33%) might have been in the news recently for all the wrong reasons, but that’s not stopping Wedbush from issuing one of Wall Street’s most bullish calls on the company in months. In a note Friday morning, analyst Dan Ives raised Tesla’s price target from $350 to $500, saying “the golden age of autonomous is now on the doorstep for Tesla.” The price hike is part of Ives’ larger vision for the company: a possible $2 trillion market cap by the end of 2026 in a “bull case scenario.” The potential catalyst? The long-promised launch of Tesla’s robotaxi service, which CEO Elon Musk claims will debut in Austin by the end of June — a “key next chapter of growth,” according to Ives. Wedbush’s price hike reflects this “massive stage of valuation creation ahead.” But Wedbush’s vision of Tesla is less about cars and more about code. “We have never viewed Tesla simply as a car company,” Ives wrote. “Instead we have always viewed Musk and Tesla as a leading disruptive technology global player and the first part of this grand strategic vision has taken shape over the past 5 years.” Ives sees Tesla as a platform positioned to capitalize on the convergence of autonomous driving and AI — an “AI revolution” that could eventually put Tesla in the same league as Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%), Microsoft (MSFT-0.92%), Palantir (PLTR+1.01%), Amazon (AMZN-2.87%), Meta (META-2.36%), OpenAI, and Alphabet (GOOGL-1.57%). “We believe Tesla remains the most undervalued AI play in the market today,” Ives said. “The core focus for investors is the AI Revolution is now coming to Tesla...which will make Tesla one of the best pure plays on AI over the next decade.” Ives said AI and autonomous are worth at least $1 trillion for Tesla. And the “golden goose”? The EV-maker’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, which has recently been more broadly rolled out. Wedbush said the automaker could see FSD adoption rates rise past 50% “and change the financial model/margins for Tesla looking ahead.” Still, the road to autonomy is littered with setbacks. Tesla’s FSD system has faced regulatory scrutiny and safety concerns for years, although Ives speculated that the close ties between Musk and President Donald Trump could help pave the way for fewer regulatory hurdles. And Musk’s timelines for autonomous Teslas have come and gone without delivery; FSD remains driver-assist tech, requiring a human at the wheel. Tesla also isn’t alone in the robotaxi push — Alphabet’s Waymo and Uber (UBER+0.83%) are still major contenders in the U.S., and China’s Baidu (BIDU-2.13%) is pushing forward on robotaxis abroad. Still, Ives believes Tesla has a leg up on the competition. “Given its unmatched scale and scope globally,” he wrote, “we believe Tesla has the opportunity to own the autonomous market and down the road license its technology to other auto players both in the US and around the globe.” Wedbush maintains its “Outperform” rating on Tesla, even as Ives warned that the stock’s trajectory will be volatile. “Rome was not built in a day,” he wrote, “and neither will Tesla’s autonomous and robotics strategic vision.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: The best IEMs for gaming in 2025, tested and reviewed

By Chris Coke Published May 23, 2025 10:00 AM EDT We may earn revenue from the products available on this page and participate in affiliate programs. Learn more › I’ll tell you a secret: If you’re a gamer searching for the best sound quality for your games, you shouldn’t be looking at a gaming headset. Audio enthusiasts know that the best sound quality—for movies, games, and everything in between—comes from great headphones and in-ear monitors (IEMs). But when it comes to getting the the best isolation, audio, and comfort in a compact form factor, IEMs are the only way to go especially if you game on the go. If you’re on the hunt for an upgrade to your current headset and don’t mind using a separate microphone (at least, most of the time), there are lots of incredible options out there. I’ve been part of the IEM hobby for years and have done the hard work of testing dozens upon dozens of sets, on the hunt for the best of the best—like our top overall, the FiiO FA19. If you’re a gamer, this list is for you. I’ve been a gamer for as long as I can remember, cutting my teeth on the Atari 2600. In fact, I got my start in journalism writing about games for a number of small websites. In my adult life, I’ve fallen in love with the world of audio and IEMs in particular. I currently maintain an archive of over 100. Between my closet and storage spaces, I have around 30 pairs of headphones and have given away more gaming headsets than most people will in a lifetime. TL;DR: I love tech, I love gaming, and I love writing about the best picks for different types of people. This list represents my biggest hobbies, rolled into one. Chris Coke Why it made the cut: A customizable sound signature, great details, and a comfortable fit, the FA19 is tops for gaming. If you’re looking for the best of the best when it comes to gaming IEMs, the FiiO FA19 has you covered. This set doesn’t come cheap, but it’s an absolute banger for gaming and music alike. With its customizable sound signature, comfortable fit, and fantastic sound quality, it’s a stellar pick no matter what genre you’re gaming in. FiiO has been one of the biggest companies to watch for a number of years. Getting its start making portable digital audio players (DAPs) and amps, it has since expanded into IEMs, over-ear headphones, desktop amps and streaming media players, speakers, CD and cassette players, and that’s not even the full list. What’s even more impressive is that in most areas where it’s attempted to compete, it’s been able to offer high-quality options at prices that are comparatively quite reasonable. The FA19 is exactly such an option. It uses 10 balanced armatures per side and a shell 3D printed in medical-grade resin. It’s a comfortable fit, even as it offers 20 total speakers between its two earpieces, which usually necessitates a monster shell. The FA19 isn’t small, but it’s not uncomfortably large like many of its competitors are. That many drivers might seem excessive, but there’s a good reason for that excess. Each driver can concentrate on a particular frequency band, ensuring that none are pushed beyond their limits and that distortion is never a concern. Just as importantly, for gaming, all of those drivers make it easier to hear each distinct detail in the environment around you. You’ll never have to worry about footsteps or enemy vehicles sneaking up on you because they got lost in the mix. The FA19 provides exceptionally good layering, so you’ll always be able to make out every unique element that makes up your soundscape. It has also allowed the acoustic engineers at FiiO to fine-tune both of its distinct sound signatures. While the FA19 is hardly the only pair of in-ear monitors to offer a tuning switch, it is one of the few where its addition makes a meaningful difference to the sound. Here, you’re given the option between a reference tuning that’s perfect for discerning small details and a hi-fi tuning that provides a more exciting sound signature with added bass and treble. When I tested these, I found that I preferred the hi-fi tuning for its added energy and that it still performed well even in competitive shooters. For the utmost clarity, its reference option makes for a great alternative. And, surprise, surprise (not really), they are fantastic for music. It comes with a modular cable that supports a standard 3.5mm single-ended connection, as well as a 4.4mm Pentaconn connection for balanced sources, so you should be able to connect to everything from your motherboard to prestigious audiophile hardware (I recommend using a dedicated DAC for the best listening experience). When I’m not gaming with them, I’m using them to play guitar on stage with my church for a clean monitor mix. The only thing they lack is a microphone and a more accessible price point. But with the exception of only a few options in the IEM world, you’ll need to provide your own microphone anyway, so it’s hard to be too critical of this point. Overall, the FiiO FA19 is a pricey but outstanding pair of IEMs. They’re exceptional for gaming. And just about everything else, if you can afford them, they’re an easy recommendation. Tony Ware Why it made the cut: An expansive, holographic soundstage with impressively precise imaging offers strong spatial awareness in competitive gaming. The Kiwi Ears Aether carves a niche with a deft touch, walking the sonic tightrope between analytical precision and atmospheric immersion. These IEMs offer a soundstage that punches above their price point—an expansive, layered field that critics and users alike describe as impressively holographic. It’s not just wide; it’s well-structured, delivering the kind of positional accuracy that audiophiles crave and gamers covet. For music, the Aether’s oversized 15.3mm planar-magnetic diaphragms impress with articulate mids and a tight low end—clean enough for complex jazz arrangements, yet warm enough to give synth-heavy ambient tracks a sense of emotional heft. Highs shimmer without searing, providing detail without fatigue, a characteristic that makes long listening sessions a joy rather than a chore. The soundstage—wide, tall, and deep—creates breathing room for instruments, giving the illusion of space that’s more reminiscent of open-back headphones than a pair of IEMs. But where the Aether really surprises is in gaming mayhem. Footstep tracking in FPS titles is intuitive, thanks to that same dimensional clarity. Environmental cues and directional insights feel more vivid, not just heard but placed—a rare trait in IEMs under $500. Some might perceive a dip in sub-bass impact compared to bass-heavy sets (like the Kiwi Ears x HBB Punch), but it’s a tradeoff that benefits overall transitions and transparency. There’s a cohesion, a refinement to the sound throughout the frequency range, thanks to the single-driver, crossover-free setup (the same reason dynamic driver fans love the low-profile Sennheiser IE 600). The Kiwi Ears Aether isn’t trying to win you over with bombast. It’s a refined, thoughtful performer—an IEM that feels just as at home in a playlist deep-dive as it does in a multiplayer skirmish. Turtle Beach Why it made the cut: This affordable pair of IEMs adds a microphone to the mix and a surprisingly good tuning. Look no further than the Turtle Beach Battle Buds for gaming performance on a budget. At only $30 MSRP and frequently available for less, these earbuds represent one of the best values in IEMs dedicated to gaming. Between its price, performance, and versatility, they’re one of the only pairs of affordable “gaming earbuds” I recommend comfortably. They’re a great value for gamers on a budget. While there are plenty of IEMs that offer in-line microphones, there are very few that feature dedicated boom mics, but that’s exactly what this has. It’s clearer and louder than most in-line mics due to its proximity to your mouth, and that comes in clutch when you need to strategize with your team. When it’s not needed, it simply unplugs from the left earpiece, allowing you to have less weight and improved comfort as needed. Turtle Beach wisely outfitted each earpiece with a silicone retention wing, similar to exercise earbuds, so even with the mic installed, its weight doesn’t get in the way of comfort and stability. The quality of that mic is also surprisingly good. Its closest competitor is the SteelSeries Tusq, which is significantly more expensive at around $50. To my ear, the Battle Buds offer clearer pick-up, though neither offers software enhancements on their own. Since they connect with a standard 3.5mm jack, however, they’re compatible with third-party software. My ASUS ROG Maximus Hero gaming motherboard was able to apply its enhancements without difficulty. The earbuds themselves sound fine, but their quality won’t blow your socks off. I was able to pick out footsteps easily enough, but the Battle Buds lack the impressive layering and soundstage of other options on this list. As the saying goes, you get what you pay for. But for $30 or less, they’re not bad and will let you hear everything you need to without distorting or making you cringe from sibilance. The simplicity of their design, being traditional wired earbuds, also makes them versatile to use with different gaming platforms. Essentially, if your gaming system has a 3.5mm jack, they’re going to work, so PC, Switch, PS5, and Xbox are all perfectly compatible. At the same time, there’s no built-in DAC to add extra features like surround sound that would usually come with gaming headsets. This is something to keep in mind for most IEMs, however, and even those that do include DACs rarely offer surround sound or gaming features. As with most budget audio products, there are some concessions you’ll need to make with the Turtle Beach Battle Buds, but for their price, they are a fantastic value for anyone who wants the fit and function of in-ear monitors with a dedicated boom mic. There are plenty of other options that are worth considering, especially if you have a particular feature or purpose in mind. Even if you look for the “best earbuds for esports,” you’ll still find dozens of options to sift through, so I recommend a few other, more specialized sets to anyone scouring the market. For esports, look no further than the ZiiGaat x Fresh Reviews Arete. This set was tuned by Fresh Reviews, a popular YouTuber specializing in finding the best IEMs, headphones, and mice for competitive gaming. Though the brand is still relatively new, it has made a good name for itself with its handful of releases so far. This particular set features a single dynamic driver and four balanced armatures and can deliver a full and detailed sound signature that is also enjoyable for music. Still, it’s clear that competitive gaming was at the forefront of the YouTuber’s mind throughout the design process. It can pull important details like footsteps out of the mix in a way that enhances your situational awareness without sounding tinny like some full-sized gaming headsets. Like most picks, you will need a separate microphone with the ZiiGatt x Fresh Reviews Arete, which is something to keep in mind before pulling the trigger. Because they support a standard detachable cable, however, it’s easy to replace with a different option that includes one, like the Antlion Kimura. If you’re interested in cutting the cord, look no further than the Arc 3 Gaming Earbuds from Cleer Audio. While this is technically a cheat—as earbuds and in-ear monitors aren’t the same thing, and open-ear true wireless earbuds are even more removed—but it’s hard to deny the multiplatform, multipoint tech on display here. Featuring 16.2mm graphene drivers suspended at the ear canal opening to beam expansive, optimized spatial audio into your head while you maintain situational awareness. You don’t want someone sneaking up on you in real life anymore than you do in a game. Cleer Audio While there are plenty of true wireless earbuds to choose from, most pair over standard Bluetooth, which isn’t suited for gaming thanks to its higher latency. The Arc 3 buds sidestep that entirely with an included USB Type-C 2.4GHz dongle for a dedicated, ultra-low 30ms latency connection. You can plug it directly into your PlayStation 4 or 5, Nintendo Switch, Meta Quest, or your PC and enjoy wired-like gaming with the ease and freedom of true wireless. The Arc 3 simultaneously features Bluetooth 5.4 with Snapdragon Sound (supporting SBC and AAC but also aptX Lossless and LDAC) for hi-res music listening or conversations on the go. Plus there’s a dedicated app to fine-tune its performance and sound, which includes an adaptive mode that adjusts the volume to your surroundings. Their case is a little bulkier than the Galaxy Buds Pro 3 or Apple AirPods Pro, but along with the built-in batteries in each earbud, they offer an impressive 50 hours of battery life. Plus, they’re tuned for gaming audio and Dolby Atmos surround sound, so whether you’re playing a competitive shooter or getting lost in your favorite RPG, these earbuds have something for everyone. Finally, we have an additional suggestion for getting lost in your game with a deep, realistic soundstage and distinct details that enhance your immersion. For strong intelligibility and accurate placement of elements, the 7Hz Timeless 2 is another killer pick. The original Timeless has become legendary in the IEM world as one of the first sets to really kick off the affordable planar-magnetic revolution. This successor was a long time coming, but the Timeless 2 has been well worth the wait. It smooths out the frequency response of the original while still maintaining its excellent detail retrieval and crisp, wide sound signature, though its circular ear shells may appear uncomfortable at first, rest assured that the inner faces are shaped normally to fit comfortably in most ears. This is a set that you can listen to for hours and forget the world with. The stock sound signature is vocal forward with a cooler midrange, but it also comes with a set of interchangeable nozzles to customize the sound signature; however, I would recommend avoiding these as the stock nozzle provides the most balanced sound overall. Choosing a great pair of in-ear monitors is never as straightforward as you’d like it to be, and when you add gaming performance to the mix, it can be even more confusing. But, with the right pair of IEMs, you’ll find a new world of sound quality opens up for you, and you’ll hear your games in a new way—a way that gaming headsets usually struggle to come close to. So, grab an external mic and get to business. Great gaming audio is a quality pair of IEMs away.

Title: Why Buy Microsoft Stock?

Time Published: 2025-05-23T13:45:55Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Microsoft store in Manhattan, New York City, United States of America on July 16th, 2024. (Photo by ... More Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Why would you want to pay 50x cash flow for Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock, when you can buy Nvidia at about the same price? Nvidia’s revenues are growing close to 100%, Microsoft’s at 15%. Yes, not 50%, but 15%. What’s worse - Nvidia’s cash flow margins are about 47%, almost 1.7x Microsoft’s margins. In other words, more of that top line growth that Nvidia gets - makes its way to free cash flow! Cash that can be reinvested or distributed to investors as return. Good thing, who can argue? But Nvidia comes with large risk. Our High Quality (HQ) portfolio diversifies away stock-specific risks while giving exposure to upside, and has outperformed the S&P 500, the Nasdaq, and Russell 2000 - and has clocked > 91% returns since inception. Well, you could argue - Microsoft is a known, stable game. For more than 40 years, this thing has been running like a machine. Nvidia’s phenomenal growth is recent - it might fizzle. AI might fizzle. Large AI models might fizzle - or worse, deemed unnecessary. Deepseek showed small models work just as well, right? They didn’t even use Nvidia’s latest chips. However, what are the odds that Nvidia’s chips will cease to be the hottest date in town? There lies the guesswork. Nvidia revenues grew more than 80% annually, on average, in the last 3 years - and last year grew more than 100%. Could this drop to 60% or 40% growth? It has to - soon! See: Buy or Sell Nvidia? Nvidia’s biggest customers are the likes of Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon. These companies, each of them, spent more than tens of billions last year on Nvidia chips. Can Microsoft, Google, and others continue to spend 100% MORE on Nvidia chips next year? And the year after? Can they do it while their own revenue grows only 15% annually? The answer is absolutely not. The Nvidia 80-100% growth music has to stop at some point. When this high pitched growth music stops, Nvidia’s valuation will drop. A lot. But then, it might continue at a slower pace, at 20-30%, not bad, but not ridiculously high either. Point is, that’s why buying a little bit of Microsoft is OK. It’s also why you build a portfolio. A resilient one. To balance risk-reward. We did it in spades with the Trefis High Quality (HQ) portfolio. Balancing risk-reward is how HQ outperformed the S&P 500, the Nasdaq, and Russell 2000. HQ outperformed all of them, and has clocked >91% returns since inception. That’s why you buy a little bit of Microsoft, or Google, META, Amazon, and perhaps even Edwards Lifesciences. Comparison as a tool: The purpose of comparing Microsoft with Nvidia is all about understanding the risk-reward tradeoff of an investment of interest, in this case Microsoft. In practice, investment decisions are about understanding relative attractiveness. Buy Microsoft stock or keep your money as interest earning cash? Or buy an ETF on the S&P 500? Is expected return on Microsoft stock more than that on cash - by how much? What’s the downside risk you bear to earn that extra return on Microsoft? Drawing contrast with a specific “anchor” asset, in this case Nvidia and Microsoft, serves as a powerful tool to assess the risk-reward tradeoff. Note: Always use an appropriate comparison for a ticker. Microsoft example was about “growth” and reasonably high valuation. A comparison with Nvidia provides interesting perspective as the stock offers much more at a similar valuation (FCF based) - but also carries with it, a huge downside risk. It is exactly this downside risk, versus relative upside tradeoffs we made - at scale, in constructing the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio. With a selection of 30 stocks, it has demonstrated a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past 4-year span. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks achieved superior returns with reduced risk compared to the standard index, with a smoother performance evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Dave Vellante’s Breaking Analysis: The complete collection

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MAY 23 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

Title: 10 Ways to Enrich the Trumps and the MAGA Movement

Russ Choma, Dan Friedman, and Tim MurphyMay 22, 2025 Illustrations by James Clapham Illustrations by James Clapham Eight years ago, if you wanted to line the first family’s pockets, your choices—while ethically unprecedented—were limited. There was only so much you could spend on hotel rooms or Mar-a-Lago fundraisers. Fortunately for foreign governments, megacorporations, and anyone else with an agenda, the Trumps have diversified. “It’s a whole different scale than it was in 2017,” observes Noah Bookbinder, president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, who says President Donald Trump and his underlings “seem to believe that the American people don’t care. They’re not making much of an effort to hide any of this stuff.” A post shared by Mother Jones (@motherjonesmag) The options for paying tribute to the president, his kin, and the MAGA movement are now legion. There are even exciting new opportunities to protect your business by reaching a “settlement” with the leader of the free world. Or you can just hand over a 747 for him to use as Air Force One, as Qatar did. Best of all, these creative funding methods might not even be against the law—especially for Trump. (Thanks, SCOTUS!) So here’s your guide to participating in the brave new Trumpworld of executive enrichment. As the “Bitcoin orange” Trump-branded watches ($799) indicate, the 47th commander in chief is the “Crypto President.” Last year, Trump rolled out his own crypto firm, called World Liberty Financial. After Trump won, crypto investor Justin Sun bought $75 million worth of WLF tokens, with more than $50 million of that potentially going to the Trumps, according to Bloomberg. Shortly after Trump took office, the Securities and Exchange Commission—which had accused Sun of fraud in a federal complaint—agreed to pause its lawsuit while the parties pursued a “potential resolution.” That was one of more than a dozen lawsuits and investigations targeting crypto firms that the SEC reportedly backed off from after Trump took office. Foreign governments can get in on the action, too. A state-backed United Arab Emirates firm, for instance, recently agreed to use a Trump-affiliated digital coin in a multibillion-dollar deal—a move that, according to the New York Times, could hand the Trump family hundreds of millions of dollars. Savvy investors can also purchase $TRUMP, a meme coin the president launched just before his inauguration. A billion $TRUMP coins will ultimately be made available, though a company affiliated with the Trumps will own many of them—so if demand causes the price to rise, the Trumps theoretically get wealthier. The coin’s value rocketed past $70 before inauguration, then immediately crashed. But in April, it ticked up to more than $15—after the coin’s official website offered dinner with Trump at his DC-area golf club and a “VIP White House Tour” to the top $TRUMP holders. (The White House tour offer quickly disappeared following an uproar.) This week, Sun identified himself as the top $TRUMP investor. He declared his excitement to attend the president’s “Gala Dinner as his TOP fan” and “discuss the future of our industry.” Sun now holds $18.6 million worth of $TRUMP, according to CNBC. If you can’t match that, don’t worry: $MELANIA coins go for less than a buck. This is a simple one—you don’t even have to invest in $TRUMP coins. Business leaders can now simply pay $5 million for one-on-one meetings with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, Wired reported. If that’s too rich for your blood, there’s a cheaper option—donors can pony up $1 million each for a small-group “candlelight dinner” with the president. “This exorbitant level of payment for presidential access raises serious concerns about the possibility of corruption by candlelight,” Jon Golinger, a transparency advocate with Public Citizen, told USA Today. For those who recall the five-alarm scandal generated in the ’90s when the Clinton administration rewarded major campaign donors with overnight stays in the Lincoln Bedroom—well, clearly, that was a more innocent time. Trump’s ethical outrages are so numerous and brazen that these meals have barely registered a blip. The dinners are organized by MAGA Inc., a super-PAC that backed Trump’s 2024 campaign—and that also has spent tens of millions of dollars to cover Trump’s personal legal expenses. A “source with direct knowledge of the dinners,” however, told Wired that “it’s all going to” Trump’s future presidential library. Then again, the $400 million Qatari jet supposedly will, too. Trump has turned his vendettas against law firms that cross him into executive orders that threaten their ability to operate. When firms have fought back, judges have blocked Trump’s “unprecedented attack” on the rule of law. But some of the country’s wealthiest firms have made a different choice—accepting humiliating “settlements” with the president and promising tens of millions of dollars in free legal work for causes he supports. Paul Weiss was the first to capitulate, agreeing to provide $40 million in pro bono work in support of what Trump described as “the Administration’s initiatives.” From there, the price skyrocketed. Skadden inked a preemptive deal for at least $100 million in free legal work. Then five more firms cut deals for $100 million to $125 million apiece. Trump hopes to “use these very prestigious firms to help us out” on projects ranging from his trade war to protecting the coal industry. “Big Law continues to bend the knee to President Trump because they know they were wrong, and he looks forward to putting their pro bono legal concessions toward implementing his America First agenda,” Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, has said. For years, Trump has filed lawsuits over news coverage he dislikes. Many of these cases have been thrown out of court. But after the 2024 election, some of the world’s most powerful media companies decided to fork over millions of dollars rather than fight back. It began in December, when Disney agreed to give $15 million to Trump’s presidential library foundation to settle a dubious defamation claim against ABC News. Then Meta, Facebook’s parent company, agreed to pay its own $25 million library tribute to settle a lawsuit Trump brought after the platform banned him following the January 6 insurrection. “It looks like a bribe and a signal to every company that corruption is the name of the game,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted. X—now controlled by Elon Musk—soon followed, settling a similar case for $10 million. Paramount executives reportedly believe that settling a Trump lawsuit against CBS, which it owns, would ease the path to a lucrative merger with Skydance. Paramount, which so far hasn’t surrendered, called the case an “affront to the First Amendment…without basis in law or fact” in a March court filing. Trump is also leveraging his control of the Federal Communication Commission to demand “the maximum fines and punishment” for CBS. “They should lose their license!” he declared. In a letter to Paramount’s chairperson Monday, Warren and other lawmakers charged that the company appears to be trying to settle the lawsuit and “moderating the content of its programs” in an effort to win FCC approval for the merger. “If Paramount officials make these concessions,” the lawmakers wrote, it might amount to an illegal “quid pro quo.” When the Washington Post spiked an already written Kamala Harris endorsement last year, its owner, Jeff Bezos, wanted to make one thing clear: There was “no quid pro quo.” Yes, he acknowledged, the head of Blue Origin—a Bezos company that competes for billions in government contracts—met with Trump the day the paper killed the editorial. But that was just an unfortunate coincidence. “When it comes to the appearance of conflict, I am not an ideal owner of the Post,” Bezos conceded. “Every day, somewhere, some Amazon executive or Blue Origin executive, or someone from the other philanthropies and companies I own or invest in is meeting with government officials.” Indeed. In December, after Melania Trump had pitched a documentary about herself to Amazon’s film studio, Bezos had dinner with the incoming first couple, according to the Wall Street Journal. Amazon later agreed to pay a whopping $40 million to license the film; 70 percent of that goes directly to Melania. An Amazon spokesperson said the dinner “was separate from any discussions” about the film. “We licensed the upcoming Melania Trump documentary film and series for one reason and one reason only—because we think customers are going to love it,” the spokesperson said. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kusher advised his father on Middle Eastern matters during the president’s first term, with questionable results. But that work likely helped Kushner win hundreds of millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and a United Arab Emirates fund for a private equity firm he launched after leaving the White House. Kushner’s company, Affinity Partners, also landed lucrative development deals with the governments of Serbia and Albania. He’s building a luxury Trump- branded property in a former Yugoslav Ministry of Defense building, empty since NATO bombed it in 1999. And in Albania, Kushner plans to construct a luxury resort on an island once used as a military outpost. Those deals were reportedly brokered by Richard Grenell, who forged ties with both governments while serving as Trump’s special envoy in the Balkans. Both countries want US help joining the European Union despite long-standing corruption challenges, among other issues. Grenell is now Trump’s envoy for special missions, a global portfolio that could make him a valuable friend for any enterprising foreign government. When he took office in 2017, Trump refused to relinquish ownership of his business empire, which offered obvious opportunities for those with means to enrich him. That hasn’t changed. He still owns nine hotels, 18 golf courses, four commercial real estate properties, six estates, and a real estate brokerage. In his first term, these properties took in tens of millions in revenue—including a $15.8 million condo sale to a woman linked to Chinese military intelligence and a $13.5 million mansion sold to an Indonesian politician and businessman (who is developing two Trump golf resorts). Trump no longer owns the Washington, DC, hotel that served as a clubhouse for Republican lobbyists and foreign leaders in his first term. But Trump’s other hotels—like one in New York that saw a huge revenue boost in 2018 hosting the entourage of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman—are still going strong. The Trump Org says it plans to open 10 new properties, including a hotel in the UAE’s Dubai and a golf resort in Oman. The White House claims the Trump family’s businesses don’t create conflicts of interest because “the president’s assets are in a trust managed by his children.” But that trust isn’t blind, so the president can still know who’s helping him—and his kids—get richer. Sure, you could buy a club membership and some Trump-branded golf accessories. But if you really want to help out the president, bring him a whole tournament. That’s what Turkish Airlines—in which the Turkish government controls a 49 percent stake—did when it hosted a tournament at Trump’s course outside DC during his first year in office. After the January 6 coup attempt, the PGA distanced itself from Trump. But the Saudi sovereign wealth fund–owned league LIV Golf rushed to embrace Trump, hosting numerous tournaments at his courses around the United States. The latest took place in April at Trump’s National Doral Golf Club in Miami—just as Trump’s tariffs were crashing the stock market. Trump claims the tournaments are “peanuts” to him financially, but industry experts say each one is a multimillion-dollar deal for his businesses. In a deposition in 2023, Trump bragged that he could sell his Turnberry course in Scotland to LIV Golf for “a fortune,” though he declined to say whether such an offer had actually been made. Trump isn’t the first president to accept corporate contributions for his inauguration, but the scale is unprecedented. Meta and Amazon weren’t shy about their huge donations of $1 million each—the public obsequiousness was the point. Pilgrim’s Pride, owned by a subsidiary of Brazilian meat company JBS, gave $5 million. In April, JBS—which has a history of scandals and legal problems—won SEC approval to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, a longstanding company goal that the agency had previously blocked. A spokesperson for JBS told Forbes that the inaugural donation was not related approval of the stock listing. Syngenta—an agribusiness giant that is owned by a Chinese government–controlled firm and is currently fighting a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit—kicked in $250,000. In February, the SEC dropped a lawsuit against crypto platform Coinbase, which gave $1 million to Trump’s inauguration. Coinbase, Pilgrim’s Pride, and the SEC didn’t respond to questions from Mother Jones; Amazon noted it also gave to Joe Biden’s inauguration, and Syngenta said it works “with both sides of the aisle.” The money helped Trump—who reportedly kept close tabs on who paid up—raise more than $200 million for lavish inaugural events. Any surplus can be transferred to a political committee or his eventual presidential library. Inaugural committees also offer opportunities for presidential enrichment. In 2022, for example, Trump’s previous inaugural committee paid $750,000 to settle a lawsuit accusing it of overpaying Trump properties that hosted events. While serving as a Trump Org executive, the president’s eldest son has also launched a series of anti-woke ventures. He’s a partner at 1789 Capital, which invests in conservative companies, and he’s slated to join the board of online firearms retailer GrabAGun. Don Jr. doesn’t have an official White House job, but he’s touted his influence over administration personnel decisions and MAGA politics. He recently traveled, twice, to Serbia—where Kushner and the Trump Org are developing a hotel—and lent his support to the country’s embattled president. For moguls who aren’t ready to do a deal with Don Jr., there’s now a more direct way to send him and his business partners money—an exclusive, invite-only DC club called “Executive Branch” that reportedly costs more than a half-million dollars to join. The plan, according to Politico, is “to ensure the C-suite crowd can mingle with Trump advisers and cabinet members without the prying eyes of the press and wanna-be insiders.” Arthur Schwartz, an adviser to Don Jr., downplayed his influence in the White House but declined to respond in greater detail when asked whether his activities create ethical problems. “Write your ridiculous story.

Full Content:
Characterizing DNA methylation patterns is important for addressing key questions in evolutionary biology, development, geroscience, and medical genomics. While costs are decreasing, whole-genome DNA methylation profiling remains prohibitively expensive for most population-scale studies, creating a need for cost-effective, reduced representation approaches (i.e., assays that rely on microarrays, enzyme digests, or sequence capture to target a subset of the genome). Most common whole genome and reduced representation techniques rely on bisulfite conversion, which can damage DNA resulting in DNA loss and sequencing biases. Enzymatic methyl sequencing (EM-seq) was recently proposed to overcome these issues, but thorough benchmarking of EM-seq combined with cost-effective, reduced representation strategies is currently lacking. To address this gap, we optimized the Targeted Methylation Sequencing protocol (TMS)—which profiles ~4 million CpG sites—for miniaturization, flexibility, and multispecies use at a cost of ~USD 80. First, we tested modifications to increase throughput and reduce cost, including increasing multiplexing, decreasing DNA input, and using enzymatic rather than mechanical fragmentation to prepare DNA. Second, we compared our optimized TMS protocol to commonly used techniques, specifically the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip (n = 55 paired samples) and whole genome bisulfite sequencing (n = 6 paired samples). In both cases, we found strong agreement between technologies (R2 = 0.97 and 0.99, respectively). Third, we tested the optimized TMS protocol in three non-human primate species (rhesus macaques, geladas, and capuchins). We captured a high percentage (mean = 77.1%) of targeted CpG sites and produced methylation level estimates that agreed with those generated from reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (R2 = 0.98). Finally, we confirmed that estimates of 1) epigenetic age and 2) tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns are strongly recapitulated using data generated from TMS versus other technologies. Altogether, our optimized TMS protocol will enable cost-effective, population-scale studies of genome-wide DNA methylation levels across human and non-human primate species. DNA methylation profiling is important for understanding key questions in biology, but current techniques can be expensive and have technical limitations. Enzymatic methyl sequencing (EM-seq) was proposed as a potential solution, but thorough testing is still needed. In this study, we optimized a new method (Targeted Methylation Sequencing or TMS) to make it more cost-effective, flexible, and applicable to multiple species. We tested modifications to increase sample multiplexing, reduce DNA input, and use enzymatic fragmentation. We compared our optimized TMS protocol to common methylation profiling techniques and found strong agreement in DNA methylation levels. We also successfully applied the optimized TMS protocol to three non-human primate species. Finally, we show that common analyses of DNA methylation data produce similar results using TMS data versus data from other technologies. Together, we hope this work will enable cost-effective, population-scale DNA methylation profiling across human and non-human species.

Understanding variation in DNA methylation levels across tissues, the lifespan, disease states, and populations is important for addressing key questions in biology. DNA methylation—the covalent addition of methyl groups to cytosines—is a semi-malleable and environmentally-responsive epigenetic modification involved in gene regulation in many species, including our own [1]. Because DNA methylation moderates gene expression throughout the life course, it is critical for processes such as development [2–4], cell programming [5], tissue specificity [6], aging [7–11], and disease progression [12–14]. For example, changes in DNA methylation are considered a “hallmark” of the aging process, with most studies reporting age-associated gains in methylation in hypomethylated regions (e.g., promoters and transcribed regions) and age-associated losses in methylation in hypermethylated regions (e.g., heterochromatic regions, Polycomb-repressed regions) [15–17]. These age-related patterns are so consistent that DNA methylation variation have been used to construct molecular clocks that reliably predict chronological age [18,19]. Further, because DNA methylation is known to respond to environmental inputs, it has been implicated as a mechanism through which diverse environmental exposures can impact long-term physiology and health (e.g., famine [20–24], psychosocial stress [25–29], or infection [30–33]). To profile genome-wide DNA methylation at scale, most studies rely on reduced representation methods: human studies have largely favored microarrays, while non-human studies have favored reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) due to the lack of species-specific microarrays (though recent work has led to the development of the Infinium Mouse DNA Methylation BeadChip as well as the Mammalian Methylation Array) [34–36]. Both RRBS and microarrays quantify DNA methylation at a subset (1–5%) of CpGs in the genome, and thus provide a cost-effective strategy relative to genome-wide assays (e.g., whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS)). For example, the Infinium MethylationEPIC v2.0 BeadChip, or EPIC array, covers ~ 930K CpG sites including functional elements identified by the ENCODE project [37], DNase hypersensitive sites, and putatively important sites for human disease and development [38,39]. In contrast, RRBS fragments DNA using the Msp1 enzyme that cuts DNA at CCGG motifs, which following size selection, enriches for 1–5% of the genome with high CpG content such as CpG islands and gene bodies [34,40]. Importantly, both microarrays and RRBS rely on sodium bisulfite, which converts unmethylated cytosines to thymine while leaving methylated cytosines protected from conversion. This chemical reaction requires high pHs and temperatures, which can cause unwanted DNA fragmentation and damage, especially to unmethylated cytosines [41]. Ultimately, such damage can create difficulties during library preparation as well as biases in the downstream data [41–43]. Enzymatic methyl sequencing (EM-seq) offers a useful alternative to bisulfite sequencing with several key benefits: EM-seq relies on enzymatic rather than chemical conversion of unmethylated cytosines to thymine, resulting in substantially less DNA damage [42]. As a result, whole genome EM-seq has been shown to recover more CpGs sites, have lower duplication rates, have better between-replicate correlations, and require less DNA input than WGBS [42]. However, existing EM-seq benchmarked protocols rely on whole genome rather than reduced representation strategies, hindering their adoption especially for population-scale studies. To address this gap, Twist Biosciences recently created a hybrid capture panel that targets ~4 million CpG sites in the human genome and is compatible with EM-seq. The Twist methylation capture reaction uses ~ 550k probes to target functionally relevant CpG sites (e.g., those in enhancers, gene bodies, and near transcription start sites) and to cover ~95% of CpG sites included on the widely used EPIC array [44–47]. Off the shelf, this protocol is similar or lower in cost to existing reduced representation approaches. However, we note that total cost for any sequencing-based approach will depend on the desired coverage (i.e., the average number of reads that cover each CpG site); best practices for average per CpG coverage are still debated, but most studies recommend at least 20x [48–51]. Increased coverage will increase the precision of DNAm estimates, and thus to some degree the desired coverage depends on the anticipated effect size. Here, we aimed to develop and benchmark an optimized and further cost-reduced version of the targeted methylation sequencing (TMS) approach suitable for population-scale studies, including both human and non-human primate (NHP) studies (Fig 1A). To do so, we built upon the off the shelf TMS protocol (Fig 1B), which recommends 8 plexing of samples per capture reaction and 200 ng of DNA input, and tested four multiplexing strategies (12, 24, 48, and 96 plex, using 200 ng of sample input; Fig 1C). We also tested five DNA input amounts (25, 50, 100, 200, and 400ng, using the 12-plex strategy) and other minor protocol modifications such as varying the annealing temperature during hybrid capture and varying the method used for DNA fragmentation (Fig 1C). Following optimization, we assessed: 1) the robustness of our protocol through a direct comparison with the EPIC array and WGBS; 2) the extension of optimized TMS for use in NHP species; and 3) the ability of our protocol to recapitulate biological results (epigenetic age estimates and identification of tissue-specific patterns) obtained from data generated using other technologies (see Table 1 for sample sizes and sample information; Fig 1C). Overall, we found that we were able to miniaturize and optimize the TMS protocol to ~USD 80 per sample, while maintaining data quality and comparability to existing methods. In total, our protocol provides coverage of approximately four times as many CpG sites relative to the EPIC array at one fourth the cost—a ~ 16-fold gain in the data-to-price ratio (S1 Table). [A] To optimize the TMS protocol, we used samples from three human and three NHP populations: the Tsimane of Bolivia, a Vanderbilt University Medical Center cohort, the Orang Asli of Malaysia, rhesus macaques from Cayo Santiago in Puerto Rico, tufted capuchins from captive sites throughout the United States, and gelada monkeys from Ethiopia. Created using BioRender. [B] The TMS protocol begins with DNA fragmentation and adapter ligation. Next, two enzymes, TET2 and APOBEC, are used to oxidize and deaminate the DNA. TET2 recognizes methyl groups attached to cytosines and converts them to Ca/g. APOBEC follows TET2 and converts the unmethylated cytosines to uracils. Following PCR amplification (which converts uracils to thymines), hybrid capture is used to enrich for targeted regions of the genome. Samples are then assayed via high throughput sequencing.

Raw quality control metrics such as percent CHH methylation (a proxy for the rate at which unmethylated cytosines are converted to thymine) and mapping efficiency (percent of reads uniquely mapped to the genome) were high for all samples. Mapping efficiency was consistent across plexing strategies (average mapping efficiency: 12-plex = 71.9%, 24-plex = 72.9%, 48-plex = 72.5%, and 96-plex = 73.5%; ANOVA: F-value = 0.843, p-value = 0.472; Fig 2A) but affected by input amount, with higher DNA input having greater mapping efficiency (ANOVA: F-value = 13.57, p-value < 0.001, Fig 2B and S3 Table). CHH methylation was consistently well below 1%, indicative of high conversion rate across all plexing and input strategies (range = 0.1-0.27%; S1 Fig, and S4 and S5 Tables) [53].

On average, this represented 96.42% and 92.19% coverage of the TMS probe set across the plexing and input experiments, respectively (S8 and S9 Tables). Across experiments, we found average coverage of targeted CpG sites to be far greater than our minimum coverage of 5x, ranging from 21-89x across datasets (S2 Fig and S2 Table). In addition to consistently recovering the expected set of CpGs, we also observed extremely repeatable methylation levels across the plexing and input experiments (all R2 > 0.99; S10 and S11 Tables). The CpGs covered by our experiments were distributed across diverse genomic annotations, and the median DNA methylation levels within a given annotation displayed expected patterns (Fig 2C and 2D) [54]. For example, we observed high levels of methylation in quiescent and heterochromatin regions and low levels of methylation in promoters and transcribed regions. In experiments 1 and 2, we used the recommended 65°C annealing temperature during the hybrid capture step—where prepared DNA is bound to the capture probe set to select CpG sites of interest—and the recommended 2uL of methylation enhancer, which increases the efficiency of this reaction. Here, we found that ~3/4 of all of our mapped reads were “on-target”, meaning that they overlapped with the designed probe set and represented successful hybrid capture (S8 and S9 Tables). This suggests that ~ ¼ of reads are “off target” and randomly distributed across the genome rather than within our regions of interest. We therefore performed a third experiment using Tsimane DNA to test two protocol modifications that might decrease the off-target proportion: we increased the annealing temperature (testing 65°C or 68°C) and we varied the amount of methylation enhancer (testing 0uL, 2uL, or 4uL). We note that similar previous work has reported on-target read percentages of 75–85% [55–57], suggesting the capture reaction will likely never be completely efficient. In experiment 3, we found that increasing the annealing temperature from 65°C to 68°C resulted in a lower proportion of off-target reads (ANOVA: F-value = 84.2, p-value < 0.0001; Figs 2E and S4, and S12 Table). Across samples annealed at 65°C, an average of 78.5% of reads were on-target, while this number rose to 84.2% at 68°C. However, this increase in capture efficiency came at a cost to the breadth of CpG sites covered: across samples annealed at 65°C, we observed coverage of on average 92.0% of the probe set, while this number fell to 72.2% for samples annealed at 68°C (Fig 2F, and S13 and S14 Tables). This suggests that higher annealing temperatures lead to greater but more specific binding during the hybrid capture step, and thus the increased capture efficiency comes at the expense of recovering all the expected CpG sites. In general, we did not find meaningful differences across methylation enhancer amounts and we therefore excluded this reagent from downstream experiments (Fig 2E and 2F). Given the loss of certain genomic regions at 68°C, downstream experiments focused on a 65°C annealing temperature. We next performed a fourth experiment focused on protocol optimization, in which we varied the strategies used to fragment genomic DNA prior to EM-seq library preparation: specifically, we tested mechanical fragmentation via Covaris sonication against enzymatic fragmentation with the NEBNext UltraShear reagent. Mechanical fragmentation is the current standard approach but is expensive, requires special equipment, and is labor intensive. Conversely, enzymatic fragmentation is cheaper, does not require special equipment, and is more compatible with automation. For experiments 3 and 4, we used the 96-plex strategy and 200 ng of sample input, since experiments 1 and 2 suggested that data quality does not suffer from higher plexing strategies. These experiments used DNA from a human population in Malaysia, the Orang Asli [58]. Enzymatic fragmentation resulted in a similar number of covered sites as was previously observed with mechanical fragmentation (n = 4,591,123 and 4,523,981 filtered CpG sites for the 10 and 20 minute protocols, respectively). Average site-specific methylation levels were also highly concordant between approaches (mechanical versus 10 min enzymatic: R2 = 0.9875; mechanical versus 20 min enzymatic: R2 = 0.9876; 10 min versus 20 min enzymatic: R2 = 0.9944; S5 Fig). This was also true when we focused on a subset of DNA samples processed using both methods (n = 3; mechanical versus 10 min enzymatic: average R2 = 0.971; mechanical versus 20 min enzymatic: average R2 = 0.971; 10 min versus 20 min enzymatic: average R2 = 0.987, S15 Table). From these experiments, we concluded that enzymatic fragmentation can be substituted into the protocol with no loss to data quality. We also used these data, which represent our “best” protocol (96-plex, 200ng input, 65°C annealing, no methylation enhancer, enzymatic fragmentation), to understand two critical aspects of experimental design—how many reads one would need to generate to achieve a given mean (or median) coverage per CpG site (S6 Fig) and how this mean coverage impacts power to detect differential methylation (S3 Fig). In general, we observe a ~ 1:1 relationship between the number of mapped, paired end reads (in millions) and mean coverage, such that 20 million mapped paired end (40 million total reads) translates to ~20x mean coverage (or ~14x median coverage) per CpG site. Using simulations [49,59] of datasets of different sizes (n = 100, 200, 400) and mean coverages (20x, 40x, and 80x), we found that increasing coverage can provide power gains for smaller sample sizes, but in larger datasets increasing coverage will matter less as power is derived from the overall sample size rather than gains in precision (S3 Fig). To ensure that TMS could perform comparably to the most popular current reduced-representation technology (the EPIC array), we generated paired data for 55 samples using both platforms (and following the 96-plexing, 200 ng input TMS protocol from experiment 1). After filtering, we analyzed 682,295 CpG sites common to both technologies, and found high concordance between per-site DNA methylation levels averaged across all individuals in the dataset (R2 = 0.97; Fig 3A). We also examined correlations between the two technologies when we subsetted to 1) variably methylated CpG sites (i.e., sites with methylation levels >10% and <90%; mean R2 = 0.83; Fig 3B); 2) CpG islands, shores, and shelves (R2 = 0.97, 0.97, 0.94, respectively); 3) hypomethylated (<50% average methylation; R2 = 0.89) regions; 4) hypermethylated (>50% average methylation; R2 = 0.70) regions; and 5) particular EPIC v2 array probe types (S7 and S8 Figs). Because methylation patterns are relatively consistent across individuals for many regions of the human genome, we also confirmed that these correlations were higher for EPIC-TMS data generated from the same sample compared to EPIC-TMS comparisons made between random pairs of samples (mean R2 for all sites: 0.95 versus 0.93 for random sample pairs, mean R2 for variable sites only: 0.83 versus 0.75 for random sample pairs; S9 Fig).

This is because EPIC-derived DNA methylation levels are represented as beta values, calculated as the ratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the total locus intensity plus an offset value. Due to the addition of the offset value, beta values of 1 are mathematically impossible. As a result, the correlation between average TMS- and EPIC-measured DNA methylation levels is slightly off the x = y line (Fig 3A) and correlations are much lower than the genome-wide average for hypo- as well as hyper-methylated regions. For further validation, we also generated WGBS data for 6 Tsimane samples included in experiment 3 (96-plexing, 200 ng input, 65°C annealing temperature, no ME, mechanical fragmentation). After filtering and merging with the TMS data, we retained 3,078,771 CpG sites covered by both the TMS and WGBS approaches. For these sites, the average methylation levels observed across technologies was highly correlated (R2: 0.9871; Fig 3C). We also found that the genome-wide distribution of DNA methylation levels derived from WGBS was more similar to TMS than to the EPIC array, specifically in that it included many sites with average methylation levels of 100% or close to 100%, as expected (Figs 3D and S10). To enable epigenomic analyses in our close primate relatives, we also tested whether TMS (96-plex, 200ng input protocol from experiment 1) could be effectively applied to three NHP species: tufted capuchins (Sapajus apella; n = 28 samples from blood), rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta; n = 96 samples from 6 tissues (see S11 Fig and S16 Table)), and geladas (Theropithecus gelada; n = 68 samples from blood). While the probe set is designed from the human genome, NHP species share high levels of sequence homology with humans, especially in coding regions and regions near genes [61], leading us to hypothesize that a majority of CpG sites would be recovered. We mapped the Twist probe sequences to each of the NHP genomes to confirm this intuition, and from this analysis expected to capture 3.0-4.8 million CpG sites across the three species (Fig 4B). Importantly, for the rhesus macaque samples, we also generated paired RRBS data and compared our TMS results to a technology that does not rely on hybrid capture. [A] Optimized TMS in NHPs results in high mapping efficiencies despite the use of human-specific probes. Here, each of the species are mapped to their respective reference genome.

Further, the average CHH methylation levels were all extremely low (<1%), again suggesting high conversion rates (S12 Fig). Following filtering, we recovered ~ ½ to ¾ of expected CpG sites in the NHP datasets (3,343,133 in capuchin, 5,387,280 in gelada, and 5,486,073 in macaque). The number of sites recovered scales generally with divergence time (capuchins share a common ancestor with humans 35–45 million years ago, geladas and rhesus macaques share a common ancestor with humans 23–28 million years ago) [62]. In all species, we were able to reliably measure more sites than would be typical of RRBS (see below), and we note that some of the between-species variation in performance could be explained by heterogenous read depth (S2 Table) as well as reference assembly quality. In particular, the quality of the rhesus macaque genome is much higher than the gelada or capuchin (using CNEr in R and the N50() and N90() commands [63]): mmul_10 N50 = 153,388,924, N90 = 79,627,064; tgel1 N50 = 147,341,205, N90 = 77,542,005; cimit N50 = 5,274,112, N90 = 1,283,179. When examining average DNA methylation levels across species, we found that, as expected, all exhibited bimodal genome-wide profiles similar to humans (Fig 4F). Further, because the rhesus macaque samples were derived from 6 different tissue types (S11 Fig and S16 Table), we also confirmed that samples displayed expected tissue-specific epigenetic patterns. Specifically, we demonstrated that a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was able to reliably separate samples by tissue type (Fig 4C), as has been observed in previous studies using both bisulfite sequencing and the EPIC array [64–66]. Studies of NHP species have historically relied on RRBS because of the species-specificity of microarray technologies and the cost barrier of WGBS [49,67,68]. To test how our optimized TMS protocol compares to RRBS, we generated paired data for all 96 rhesus macaque samples. After filtering both datasets to 721,766 common CpG sites, we found a high concordance of the average DNA methylation levels estimated by both technologies (R2 = 0.97; Figs 4D and S13). This remained true when we subsetted specifically to 92,692 variably methylated CpG sites (i.e., sites with average DNA methylation levels >0.1 and <0.9; R2 = 0.5945; Fig 4E). Thus far we have compared DNA methylation levels measured with TMS versus other technologies; if these measurements are robust across platforms, then power to detect biological patterns should also be similar. We thus asked whether data generated from paired samples, but using different technologies, could recapitulate 1) epigenetic age predictions using DNA methylation-based clock algorithms [7,69–73] and 2) tissue-dependent methylation signatures when comparing diverse organ systems. For analysis #1, we used the 55 VUMC cohort samples with paired EPIC and TMS data (focusing on 682,295 CpG sites passing filters and common to both technologies). For analysis #2, we used the 96 rhesus macaque samples with paired RRBS and TMS data (focusing on 391,758 CpG sites passing filters and common to both technologies). For analysis #1, we observed a high correlation between epigenetic age estimates derived from TMS and EPIC data (Fig 5A; average R2 = 0.91). This agreement was high across a variety of existing epigenetic clock algorithms. For analysis #2, we found that effect size estimates of tissue dependency (for example, from linear models comparing DNA methylation levels in liver to all other tissues) were very similar genome-wide when applied to TMS versus RRBS data (Fig 5B and 5C). Additionally, we confirmed that sites identified as significantly associated (FDR < 5%) with a given tissue in RRBS versus TMS data overlapped more than expected by chance (Fig 5D). Together, these results support the ability of TMS data to uncover biological patterns in similar ways as revealed by other technologies.

We recommend an optimal protocol for future work (96-plex, 200ng input, 65°C annealing, no methylation enhancer, enzymatic fragmentation), but found that data quality remained high across plexing strategies, input amounts, and protocol modifications. Importantly, the 96-plex version of the TMS protocol—including sequencing to achieve ~ 25x coverage per CpG site on the Illumina NovaSeq X—can currently be performed for ~USD 80 per sample (with roughly half being reagents and labor, and the other half being sequencing on the NovaSeq X platform; S1 Table). Relative to the commonly used EPIC array for human studies, this represents massive savings enabling larger-scale, population-based studies. We recognize that the total cost of TMS will vary by the amount of sequencing performed, and we provide simulations (and modifiable code) based on real TMS coverage distributions for users to explore the impact of coverage on power for a given study design. For example, we find that with a sample size of n = 100, moderate differences in methylation (e.g., 20%) can be identified with high power at relatively low read depths (e.g., 20x), while detecting small differences would require higher read depths. However, the relative impact of coverage on power diminishes at higher sample sizes. Researchers will thus need to tailor their sequencing plan based on both their expected effect size and the number of samples in hand (S3 Fig). We found high concordance between TMS-derived DNA methylation levels and those derived from other commonly used methods—namely the EPIC array, WGBS, and RRBS. WGBS is the gold standard for comprehensive DNA methylation measurement, but is prohibitively expensive for most studies given the breadth of sequencing (to cover the whole genome) and the necessity for deep sequencing (to achieve high levels of precision) [50]. RRBS has filled in as a more cost-effective alternative, but due to the stochastic nature of the Msp1 digestion followed by size selection, not all CpG sites are reliably covered across individuals and missing data can impede downstream analyses (S14 Fig). We note that variation in coverage (and thus precision) across CpG sites will be an issue, to some degree, for any sequencing-based technology. As a result of these challenges, microarray-based methods (such as the EPIC array) have become the most commonly used approach in human genomics. Consequently, many popular bioinformatics pipelines and specialized algorithms for DNA methylation data (e.g., epigenetic clocks or cell type deconvolution [74,75]) are currently keyed to microarrays. While DNA methylation levels derived from TMS are strongly correlated with the EPIC array, it is important to keep in mind that: 1) a small subset of sites are not covered by both technologies, and 2) because microarrays output beta values (equivalent to methylated signal/(total signal + an offset)), the relationship between TMS- and EPIC-derived values cannot be exactly 1:1. We caution that care will thus be needed when applying existing microarray-based algorithms to TMS data, though our initial attempts at doing so with epigenetic clock algorithms do seem to perform well. The study of DNA methylation in NHP species is deeply important to our understanding of gene regulatory evolution [76–78], comparative aging [67,68,79,80], and environmental impacts on phenotype [68,81]. For example, both captive and field-based NHP studies have strongly contributed to our understanding of how social and ecological inputs influence fitness-related traits through changes in DNA methylation [82,83]. These studies have sometimes relied on microarrays (e.g., the Mammalian Methylation Array [36,84–86] or the application of human arrays to NHP species [87–89]). However, given the high costs of arrays, a large proportion of previous work has relied on RRBS [68,80,81,83]. Although RRBS is easily adapted for non-human species, TMS can work with smaller amounts of input DNA than bisulfite-based protocols [42], which can be critical for studies of wild or endangered species. While TMS uses capture probes designed from the human genome, NHPs share high levels of sequence similarity, which we show is sufficient to reliably capture 2–3 million CpG. Though not all ~ 4 million CpG sites are captured, TMS still represents a more consistent and cost-effective approach relative to the alternatives. Notably, we find that TMS is effective in both catarrhine (monkeys of Africa and Asia) and platyrrhine (monkeys of Central and South America) species, suggesting it may be effective in other members of these clades for capturing conserved regions. One potential issue that requires further study is that the probes (which are designed from human genetic variation) do not specifically avoid or take into account within-species polymorphisms. To show that TMS data could detect expected biological patterns, in ways that are comparable to existing technologies, we performed the same analyses of epigenetic age estimation and tissue-specificity in matched TMS, EPIC, and RRBS data, respectively. From these analyses we found that the epigenetic ages estimated with TMS versus EPIC data were highly correlated as were genome-wide estimates of tissue specific patterns from TMS versus RRBS data. The potential portability of epigenetic clock algorithms is particularly encouraging, as this approach is becoming increasingly popular for measuring biological age [90–92], and will be exciting to pair with cost-effective methods going forward. Together, our optimized TMS protocol has the potential to add value and enable larger-scale studies in the many fields that query DNA methylation patterns, such as genetic medicine, developmental biology, evolutionary biology, anthropology, public health, geroscience, and more. For the Tsimane participants, informed consent was collected at three levels: by the individual (formal written consent), by the community, and by the Tsimane Gran Consejo (Tsimane governing body). All study protocols, including the generation of DNA methylation data, were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of New Mexico (#07–157), the University of California Santa Barbara (#3-21-0652), and Universidad Mayor San Simon, Cochabomba. For the Orang Asli participants, informed consent was also collected at multiple levels: first by first describing the project to the community as a whole and seeking the permission of community leaders, and subsequently through individual-specific review of the protocol and formal written consent. The study protocol, including the generation of DNA methylation data, was approved by Vanderbilt University (IRB #212175) as well as the Malaysian Medical Research Ethics Council. For the rhesus macaque samples, the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee through the University of Puerto Rico’s Caribbean Primate Research Center (IACUC #A400117). For the gelada samples, the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at the University of Washington (protocol 4416-01) and Arizona State University (20–1754 R) along with approval from the Ethiopian Wildlife and Conservation Agency. For the tufted capuchin samples, the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Georgia State University (protocol A20018). Data generation drew on previously collected samples from multiple human and non human primate populations. A brief description of each population is provided below. The Tsimane are an Indigenous horticulturalists population spread across >90 villages in the Bolivian lowlands and totaling approximately 17,000 people [52]. We extracted DNA from 192 venous whole blood (WB) samples collected between the years of 2010–2021 as part of the Tsimane Health and Life History Project (THLHP). The THLHP has continuously collected demographic, behavioral, environmental, and health data along with the provision of medical services for over two decades [93]. Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen, transferred on dry ice to Arizona State University, and stored at -80°C prior to analysis. The sample set for this project included 103 females and 89 males, with a mean age of 54.3 years old (range 18.0–83.6 years old) (see Table 1). Genomic DNA was extracted using the Zymo Quick-DNA 96 kit (Zymo Research #D3012) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The Orang Asli consist of ~19 ethnolinguistic groups and a total population of ~210,000 people [58]. They traditionally subsist on a mixture of hunting, gathering, fishing, small-scale farming, and trade of forest products [94,95]. We extracted DNA from 88 white blood cell (WBC) samples that were collected in 2023 as part of the Orang Asli Health and Lifeways Project (OA HeLP) [58]. Samples included in data generation were derived from venous blood draws followed by washing with QIAGEN PureGene red blood cell lysis. Samples were stored in liquid nitrogen upon collection, and at -80C for longer term storage. The Orang Asli sample included 46 females and 42 males, with a mean age of 35.3 years old (range 18–78 years old; Table 1). Genomic DNA was extracted using the Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA MagBead kit (Zymo Research #R2131) following the manufacturer’s instructions. We were granted access to de-identified EPIC array data (Infinium MethylationEPIC v2.0 Kit) and TMS data from 55 paired human whole blood samples. These samples were sourced from a healthy cohort recruited through the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) in Nashville, TN USA. Due to IRB restrictions, demographic data or other metadata were not available for these samples. We obtained extracted DNA from rhesus macaque tissue samples (n = 96) collected by the Cayo Biobank Research Unit in partnership with the University of Puerto Rico’s Caribbean Primate Research Center (CPRC) [96–100]. Beginning in 2016, samples were collected from individuals living on the island of Cayo Santiago, an NIH-managed free-range colony of provisioned rhesus macaques. Specifically, as part of an ongoing population management plan designed by CPRC, select individuals were culled and tissues from all major organ systems were systematically harvested, stored in a fixative buffer, and frozen at -80C. This data set consists of samples from six different tissue types: adrenal, heart, kidney, lung, liver, and spleen, with 16 samples from each type and samples coming from 23 unique individuals (S3 Table). This dataset includes samples from 11 females and 12 males, ages 3.2 to 19.9 years old (mean 10.6 years old), collected from 2016–2019 (Tables 1 and S3). Genomic DNA was extracted using the Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA MagBead kit (Zymo Research #R2131) following the provided manufacturer’s protocols. We extracted DNA from whole blood from 68 geladas; 21 were female and 47 were male and all were considered adult (i.e., over 4 years old, the minimum average age of reproductive maturation in this species [101]) (Table 1). Gelada samples were collected as part of the Simien Mountains Gelada Research Project (SMGRP) which, since 2017, has carried out annual capture-and-release campaigns to collect morphometric data and whole blood samples from wild Ethiopian geladas [102]. Samples were stored in liquid nitrogen upon collection, and at -80C for longer term storage. Genomic DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue kits (Qiagen #69581) following the provided protocols. Blood was collected from individuals in the captive tufted capuchin monkey colony at Georgia State University in January 2023. Of the 28 capuchins, 19 were female and 9 were male with an average age of 19.4 years old (range 9–41 years old; Table 1). A trained veterinarian anesthetized the monkeys using 13 mg/kg Ketamine, delivered intramuscularly. Whole blood samples were collected during the monkeys’ annual physicals, stored at 4°C upon collection, and shipped to Arizona State University where they were flash frozen into 0.5mL aliquots and stored at -80°C until used for analysis. DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue kits (Qiagen #69581) following the manufacturer’s protocols. We used the Qubit dsDNA assay to determine the quantity of all extracted DNA. DNA libraries were normalized and prepared using the NEBNext Enzymatic Methyl-seq kit (P/N: E7120L) following a modified version of the manufacturer’s protocol that included 9 cycles of PCR for the final library amplification followed by a 0.65X bead cleanup. To prepare for the hybrid capture reaction, the total DNA input requirement (2000ng in this case) was divided by the total number of samples being pooled (12, 24, 48, or 96 as will be discussed below). In the 96-plex experiment, for example, 84ng of DNA from each sample was pooled totaling 8ug, and ¼ of the volume was used for the hybrid reaction and captured using the Human Methylome panel from Twist Biosciences following the manufacturer’s instructions (P/N: 105521). The final post-capture PCR reaction was split into 2 reactions per pool and cleaned with a 1X bead cleanup and then combined. Pool quality was assessed post-hybridization using the Agilent Bioanalyzer and quantified using a qPCR-based method with the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (P/N: KK4873) and the QuantStudio 12K instrument. Prepared library pools were sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 at the Vanderbilt Technologies for Advanced Genomics (VANTAGE) Core. We used 150 bp paired-end sequencing and generally targeted 30-50M paired-end reads per sample. Real Time Analysis Software (RTA) and NovaSeq Control Software (NCS) (1.8.0; Illumina) were used for base calling. MultiQC (v1.7; Illumina) was used for data quality assessments. For each sample, we applied the Illumina DRAGEN Methylation Pipeline v4.1.23 using the custom bed file from Twist Biosciences. The deliverables from DRAGEN consist of FASTQs, bams, cytosine reports (which include counts of methylated and unmethylated reads per CpG site), and methyl and mapping metric reports. To determine whether TMS can be effectively multiplexed beyond the recommended 8-plex, we used 96 Tsimane samples to test four different multiplexing strategies during capture: 12-, 24-, 48-, and 96-plex. To test whether TMS is robust to DNA input amounts, we tested five input amounts: specifically, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 ng of sample were used as input into the EM-seq library prep. Here, we kept the plexing strategy constant (12-plex) and used three Tsimane samples, each represented three times within each pool and included three replicates of a control sample (HG01879 from the 1000 Genomes Project) [103]. To optimize the capture efficiency of Twist target sites, we tested the use of two different annealing temperatures–65° and 68° C–along with the use of a methylation enhancer (ME)– produced by Twist Biosciences (Catalog #103557) consisting of Tris EDTA buffer to block the binding of off-target probes thereby improving on-target capture efficiency. The specific combinations we explored were: testing a 65°C annealing temperature with 0uL (n = 192), 2uL (n = 96), and 4uL (n = 96) of ME and testing a 68°C annealing temperature with 0uL (n = 96) and 2uL (n = 192) of ME. These experiments were conducted with 96-plexed Tsimane samples (n = 192), and using 200 ng of sample input. Next, we tested the use of an enzymatic fragmentation method to replace the Covaris (LE220) mechanical fragmentation approach. Mechanical fragmentation is known to decrease library quality through damage to DNA; however, enzymatic fragmentation is not currently recommended by the TMS protocol. To compare these approaches, we performed the optimized TMS with enzymatic fragmentation using 4uL of NEBNext UltraShear (NEB #M7634S/L) for 10 or 20 minutes. This experiment was conducted using 96-plexed samples from the Orang Asli (n = 88) and using 200 ng of sample input. To evaluate the efficacy of optimized TMS on three NHP species—macaques, geladas, and capuchins—we applied the 96-plex protocol design from experiment 1 with 200 ng input. To compare rhesus macaque TMS to RRBS, we generated RRBS libraries using 150 ng of DNA input in combination with 1ng of lambda phage DNA and 1uL of Msp1—a digestive enzyme which cuts CCGG nucleotide motifs. Next, using NEBNext Ultra II reagents, we performed end repair and adapter ligation to the DNA fragments produced by Msp1 digestion. We then performed bisulfite conversion on the fragments using the EZ-96 DNA Methylation Lightning MagPrep kit (Zymo Research #D5046) following the manufacturer directions. The samples were then PCR amplified for 16 cycles with unique dual indexed sequencing primers. We selected for 180–2000 bp fragments and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq S2 flow cell with 2x51bp sequencing [80,104]. For experiments 1, 2, 7, and 8, we used a custom bioinformatics pipeline to process all FASTQ files into counts of methylated versus unmethylated cytosines at each CpG site. For experiments 3, 4, 5, and 6, we used Illumina’s Dynamic Read Analysis for GENomics (DRAGEN) pipeline [105] to process all FASTQ files into counts of methylated versus unmethylated cytosines at each CpG site. Importantly, both our custom pipeline and DRAGEN follow the same general steps and rely on the Bismark suite [106], making them highly comparable. We also processed 7 samples from experiment 4 using both methods to empirically confirm that our custom pipeline and the Illumina DRAGEN pipeline produced near identical results (S15 Fig). For our custom pipeline, we first trimmed adapters using Trimmomatic (version 0.39) [107] and TrimGalore (version 0.6.6) [108] for human and NHP samples, respectively. Following trimming, we used Bismark (version 0.24.0) [106] to map reads to each species’ respective genomes (hg38 for human, mmul10 for rhesus macaque, cimit for capuchin, and tgel1 for gelada). We retained only uniquely mapped reads and used the methylation extractor function within Bismark to extract counts of methylated versus unmethylated cytosines at each cytosine. These files were further filtered for CpG contexts only. For all samples, run through either the custom or DRAGEN pipeline, we extracted two measures of data quality that are automatically calculated by Bismark: the percent of reads that mapped uniquely to the reference genome and the average methylation percentage for cytosines in a CHH context. The latter value serves as a commonly used estimate of the efficiency with which a given protocol converts unmethylated cytosines to thymine, because cytosines located outside of CpG contexts are extremely unlikely to be methylated in the mammalian genome [109,110]. Estimates of CHH methylation were extracted from an automatically generated report file when using Bismark to align the trimmed FASTQ files to the reference genome. For experiments 1 and 2, we tested whether multiplexing strategy and input amount impacted mapping efficiency and percent CHH methylation using a one-way ANOVA test, followed by a pairwise t-test in the case of significance, with the ‘aov’ and ‘pairwise.t.test’ functions in the ‘stats’ R package [111]. For each study, we used the BSseq R package [112] to compile count matrices (derived from our custom pipeline or DRAGEN) across samples and to perform region, coverage, and missingness filtering. For experiments 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 we used built-in functions in BSseq to filter for sites within the probes regions (+/- 200 bp) and for sites covered at>5X in >75% of samples. We made slight modifications to this filtering pipeline for other experiments. For experiment 2, where n = 3 for each input amount, we relaxed our missingness filter to sites with at least one read observed in at least ⅔ samples. For experiment 7, which focused on NHP genomes for which the probe set coordinates (which are provided in hg38) are irrelevant, we did not perform region filtering. The number of sites analyzed for each experiment (reported in the main text and in S4 Fig) therefore varies slightly depending on sample size, sequencing coverage, and other factors that impact which CpG sites passed our filters. To confirm the fidelity of optimized TMS, we also checked whether CpGs captured by the protocol were distributed as expected throughout different genomic regions (e.g., promoters, enhancers) and that the average methylation levels in different genomic regions were as expected. To do so, we annotated each CpG site by whether it fell into a gene body, promoter, or non-genic region, and by chromatin state. We used hg38 gene body coordinates from Ensembl’s ‘biomaRt’ package in R, and we defined promoter regions as the 2000 bp region upstream of TSSs. We annotated CpGs as falling in chromatin states as defined by hg38 ChromHMM annotations from NIH’s Roadmap Epigenomics Project [54]. We then counted the number of CpG sites that fell in each region (Fig 2C) and evaluated the median methylation across samples (Fig 2D). A subset of our experiments sought to understand and optimize two measures of efficiency of the hybrid capture step: 1) how many of the expected CpG sites from the probe set passed our filtering parameters and were thus analyzable and 2) how many of the reads we generated for a given sample were on-target and putatively captured by the probe set, rather than representing off-target randomly sequenced DNA fragments that do not contribute to analyzable data as they are often sparsely shared between samples. For #1, we used the bedtools (version 2.28.0) [113] intersect command to determine the proportion of CpG sites that are within +/- 200 bp with at least 1 probe [using a bed file available on the Twist Biosciences website (https://www.twistbioscience.com/resources/data-files/twist-human-methylome-panel-target-bed-file)]. For #2, we used the bedtools function bamtobed to convert the mapped reads for each sample into a bed file; because we used a paired end sequencing strategy, each bed coordinate included a fragment start position from R1 and a fragment end position from R2. We then used the bedtools intersect command to determine the proportion of mapped read pairs that are within 200 bp of at least 1 Twist probe. To understand what level of coverage is necessary to detect particular effect sizes in different sample sizes, we conducted a power analysis using simulated data based on the true coverage distribution of 1,000 sites in our TMS dataset, drawing with replacement to simulate sample sizes of n = 100, 200 and 400 (following the methods in [49,59]). We then assigned each sample a binary predictor variable (0 or 1), estimated methylation level differences between groups for a given effect size, and simulated the number of methylated counts per sample we would observe under this scenario by sampling from a binomial distribution (given the number of total counts and the probability of a count being methylated). We simulated data for effect sizes ranging from a 0–20% difference in methylation levels between groups and calculated power as the proportion of sites in which the predictor variable had a significant effect on methylation at a nominal p-value threshold of 0.001. We ran this analysis 3 times, first using the true mean coverage of our dataset (~20x), then again simulating coverage of 40x and 80x by multiplying the total counts of each site by 2 and 4, respectively. We used our filtered BSSeq object from experiment 5 to compare to data from the EPIC array generated for 55 paired human samples (average number of CpG sites measured with EPIC = 936,280; average call rate = 0.999). We downloaded the EPIC CpG coordinates from the Illumina website and merged with the TMS CpG locations, resulting in a shared dataset of 682,295 CpG sites passing filters and common to both technologies. We then performed two analyses to understand consistency. First, we calculated the average per-site methylation level across all samples included in the TMS or EPIC array datasets, respectively. We then ran a linear model testing the relationship between the two sets of average methylation levels using the ‘lm’ function in the ‘stats’ package in R. Second, we used the ‘lm’ function to estimate the R2 value comparing per-site methylation levels for estimates derived from each technology for a given individual (i.e., not averaged across the dataset). This resulted in a distribution of 55 R2 values. Because all humans share canonical methylation patterns, we also compared this distribution to a distribution of 55 R2 values derived from the same analysis after sample identity was permuted. We used the ‘t.test’ function in the ‘stats’ package in R to ask whether these distributions were significantly different. We used a very similar strategy to compare ~ 30x WGBS data generated for six paired Tsimane samples with TMS data generated from experiment 1 (96-plex, 200 ng input). First, we performed low level processing of the WGBS data using Illumina’s DRAGEN pipeline and merged this with our filtered TMS data, resulting in 3,078,771 CpG sites common to both datasets. We calculated the average methylation level across samples reported for each site and technology and ran a linear model using the ‘lm’ function in the ‘stats’ package in R to calculate the R2 value. We did not compare individual-based R2 values to permuted values for this experiment, given the small number of individuals. To estimate the number of CpG sites that we expected to recover when applying the human probe set to each NHP species, we converted the probe bed file to a FASTA file using the bedtools command ‘getfasta’ [113] and the hg38 reference genome. We then used Bismark to map the FASTA file to each non-human primate’s respective genome. From the mapped bam file, we used the ‘bamToBed’ function in bedtools to extract coordinates for the mapped probes and to add a + /- 200 bp offset. Finally, we applied the ‘getfasta’ function in bedtools to extract the sequence for the mapped regions (plus the 200 bp buffer) from the non-human primate genome and to count the number of CpG sites in this region set. Similar to the comparisons between TMS and the EPIC array, we used paired RRBS data for the 96 rhesus macaque samples to directly compare methylation data generated using TMS versus RRBS. To do so, we processed the RRBS data using the same custom pipeline and filtering parameters described for TMS data, with the only modification being that we used the ‘—rrbs’ parameter in TrimGalore to remove unmethylated cytosines artificially introduced during library preparation from the 3’ end of fragments. We merged the filtered TMS and RRBS datasets, resulting in 721,766 CpG sites common to both technologies. As described for the TMS-EPIC array comparison, we then 1) calculated the average per-site methylation level across all samples included in each dataset and compared these vectors using linear models and 2) estimated the R2 value for methylation level estimates derived from each technology for a given individual, and used a t-test to compare this distribution to a distribution for the same analysis where sample identity was permuted (S16 Fig). First, we compared epigenetic age predictions from paired samples that were sequenced on different platforms. We estimated epigenetic age from the PC-based versions of five well-established epigenetic clocks, including the Horvath multi-tissue clock, Hannum blood clock, PhenoAge clock, and telomere length clock. The PC-based versions of these clocks have much higher reliability and less susceptibility to technical noise than the original CpG-site level clocks [73]. We estimated epigenetic age from these clocks using the PC-Clocks R package [114] and calculated the Pearson’s correlation coefficient for estimates from samples generated with TMS versus the EPIC array. Second, we compared tissue-specific effect size estimates between samples generated with RRBS and TMS. Specifically, we asked whether tissue type significantly (FDR < 5%) predicted DNA methylation among the multi-tissue macaque data for each technology, using beta binomial models implemented in the R package ‘aod’. We performed these analyses iteratively to compare a given tissue to all other tissues (for example, comparing liver versus all other tissues to estimate liver-specific effects). We limited this analysis to variably methylated CpG sites (median methylation <90% or >10%). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011667.s001 (XLSX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011667.s002 (XLSX) P-values generated from pairwise t-tests comparing the percentage of reads that were uniquely mapped to the human genome from sequencing data generated using the TMS protocol with varying amounts of input DNA. * represents a significant (p < 0.05) difference in mapping efficiency between conditions. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011667.s003 (XLSX) P-values generated from pairwise t-tests comparing the percentage of cytosines in a CHH context marked as methylated (an estimate of conversion efficiency). * represents a significant (p < 0.05) difference in percent CHH methylation between conditions. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011667.s004 (XLSX) P-values generated from pairwise t-tests comparing the percentage of cytosines in a CHH context marked as methylated (an estimate of conversion efficiency). * represents a significant (p < 0.05) difference in percent CHH methylation between conditions. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011667.s005 (XLSX) Sites are filtered for those within the Twist probe set and covered at>5x coverage in >75% of samples.

With the judging process changing dramatically this year, which agencies won big in the D&AD Awards 2025? With the judging process changing dramatically this year, which agencies won big in the D&AD Awards 2025? For many, it's the biggest and most nerve-wracking night in the creative calendar. D&AD held its 63rd awards ceremony last night (Thursday 22 May) at London's Southbank Centre and handed out a record-breaking 668 Pencils across all categories. Most significantly, three coveted Black Pencils—the highest D&AD accolade—were awarded to groundbreaking work that exemplified the year's themes of commercial impact and narrative excellence. With no quota system for Pencil awards, D&AD maintains its reputation for uncompromising standards. In some years, no Black Pencils are given out at all, making the awarding of three a significant achievement for these winners: Designing Paris 2024 by W Conran Design won in Graphic Design for its innovative approach to sports marketing. The judges highlighted how the design created a unifying yet distinctive feel that successfully merged heritage elements with modern sporting aesthetics. A$AP Rocky - Tailor Swif by Iconoclast LA won in Music Videos, exemplifying the year's emphasis on narrative storytelling. The winning work featured long-form storytelling where music was integral to the narrative structure rather than an afterthought, demonstrating how narrative arcs can transcend different mediums and artistic disciplines. Spreadbeats by FCB New York won in Digital Marketing for what the agency described as "Innovation through nostalgic technologies." This work aligned with a trend of brands cleverly inserting themselves into events, sports, and games through inventive approaches. This year's judging process marked a major evolution in D&AD's approach. Jurors emphasised the critical importance of commercial viability, seeking work that demonstrates tangible business impact and drives meaningful behavioural change rather than celebrating creativity for its own sake. In other words, if there was ever a danger that agencies would make work primarily to win awards rather than serve the client, that's now history. In 2025, you have to do both. "This year's awards celebrated the power of design not just as a form of art but as a catalyst for commercial success and behavioural change," noted Dara Lynch, CEO of D&AD. "The idea is that innovative ideas must possess both aesthetic appeal and tangible impact." The Black Pencil winners perfectly embodied this philosophy. For instance, W Conran Design's 'Designing Paris 2024' was recognised for illustrating how design thinking can transform an entire city's attitude and behaviour. Judges from the Graphic Design category praised it as "a breakthrough for sports marketing and traditional sports marketing aesthetics," noting its playful yet scalable approach that successfully blended heritage with contemporary sport. Alongside commercial effectiveness, jurors were looking for exceptional craft. From Radio and Audio to Film, their message was clear: in an increasingly automated creative landscape, looking good simply isn't enough. "The resurgence of craftsmanship stands as a reminder that in an era of automation, true excellence lies in the thoughtful execution of ideas," Dara explained. "It's not enough just to look good; true creative excellence must also leave a lasting impression." This was particularly evident in D&AD's new Creator Content category, where judges called for clearer definitions of craft excellence and higher standards in content creation. The winning entries all demonstrated work that creates meaningful impact and genuinely engages audiences. The 2025 D&AD Awards achieved unprecedented global reach, with entries submitted from 86 countries worldwide—the highest number in the awards' history. This international participation resulted in over 30,000 pieces of work from 11,689 total entries. "It's exciting to see so many brands and companies refreshing their identities," said D&AD trustee Lisa Smith, global executive creative director at Jones Knowles Ritchie. "Judging has been challenging. Too many entries follow the same established design codes and trends, making everything start to look and feel alike, regardless of category. The work that stood out was the kind that breaks away from the expected: inspiring, well-crafted, and truly fit for purpose."

Title: Ryan Reynolds-Linked MNTN Goes Public at $16 Per Share to Grow Connected TV Ads

The company announced a $16-per-share IPO on May 21, the high end of its expected range. The share price puts MNTN’s valuation at around $1.2 billion. Actor Ryan Reynolds has served as MNTN’s chief creative officer since the company bought his creative shop, Maximum Effort, in 2021. MNTN divested from Maximum Effort in March, but Reynolds stayed on as CCO. However, Reynolds didn’t travel to New York for the IPO this week, MNTN founder and chief executive officer Mark Douglas told ADWEEK. MNTN aims to capitalize on the demand the company has seen for performance-focused CTV ad placements by going public, Douglas said. MNTN’s advertisers are primarily small and medium-sized businesses, with 96% using the ad platform to experiment with TV advertising for the first time. According to bankers’ estimates, there was demand for 14 times the shares that MNTN had available to sell, Douglas said, which helped bolster the case for an IPO. “The market responded,” he said. “A lot of our customers depend on Google, Meta, and now MNTN to help drive the growth in their business. So we want to be transparent in terms of the strength of our business, [in terms of] scale and so forth, to those companies.” MNTN’s offering consists of 11.7 million shares in total, with 8.4 million from the company itself and another 3.3 million from existing stockholders. Stockholders also gave underwriters—which include Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, and Evercore—the option to buy an additional 1.8 million shares at the initial price within 30 days of the IPO. While MNTN didn’t make an overall profit in 2024, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (also known ads EBITDA) were $39 million, Douglas noted. He expects that to increase in 2025. MNTN Is Selling Ryan Reynolds’ Agency Maximum Effort, SEC Filing Shows As it eyes the next phase of growth, MNTN plans to continue focusing on small and medium-sized businesses, Douglas said. The company will also invest in product innovation using artificial intelligence. “We like large brands also—we have some of those,” Douglas said about MNTN’s mix of clients. “But in the time it takes to get one of those, you can add 6,000 smaller brands on the platform.” Douglas sees MNTN’s role as a matchmaker rather than as an advertising company, connecting consumers with brands and products they might love through 30-second ads on popular streaming platforms like HBO Max, Bravo, and ESPN. “It’s a really impactful medium,” Douglas said. Douglas founded the company in 2009 as SteelHouse, rebranding to MNTN in 2021. Kathryn Lundstrom is Adweek's sustainability editor.

Title: 8 Best AI SEO Tools for 2025 (Tested Firsthand)
URL: https://www.semrush.com/blog/best-ai-seo-tools/
Time Published: 2025-05-22T10:43:00Z
Full Content:
As a content marketer, I regularly use AI SEO software to analyze data faster, optimize content, and achieve higher rankings. But with so many tools making bold claims, it's hard to separate the genuinely useful from the overhyped. That's why I’ve tested dozens of AI SEO tools myself and narrowed them down to the 8 that actually deliver results. Here's my detailed review of each. Spoiler alert: here are my favorite AI tools for SEO: 1. ContentShake AI for generating SEO-friendly content 2. Semrush Copilot for personalized SEO recommendations 3. Clearscope for SEO content optimization 4. SurferSEO for advanced SEO content creation 5. ChatGPT for brainstorming and data analysis 6. Copy.ai for automating your SEO workflows 7. SERP Gap Analyzer for finding keyword opportunities 8. Perplexity for conducting online content research Let’s look at each of them in detail. Semrush Content Toolkit is the smart writing tool we've developed at Semrush. It combines AI with our proprietary SEO data to help you create entire articles, find content ideas, and write in your unique brand voice. I recommend using this tool for creating SEO-friendly drafts, especially if you’re not an SEO expert. I love that it finds your target keywords and analyzes SERPs so that it can optimize your content for search intent—something SEO beginners usually struggle with. Let’s look at a sample workflow. First, enter a high-level content idea and get dozens of data-driven keyword and topic suggestions. Next, click ‘Start writing’ and choose whether you want to create an SEO content brief or generate a full blog post from scratch. This will open the setup window, where you can adjust your target keywords, content length, and brand voice. Check the ‘Add an extra SEO boost’ box for advanced SERP analysis and click ‘Create article’. In just a few minutes, your draft will be ready. You can then use the blog editor to add more original ideas and further enhance your content. Content Toolkit also includes an integrated AI chat, an AI image generator, and a content optimization tool to improve your copy. Pros Cons Very easy to use—ideal for beginners with little SEO experience Less suited to large teams and enterprise users Uses Semrush’s data to optimize AI-generated content Some stock images suggested by the tool may not always be relevant Covers the entire content creation cycle, from ideation to publishing Semrush Copilot is an AI-powered assistant that offers personalized recommendations based on your SEO performance. Copilot analyzes all of your Semrush data from tools like Site Audit, Backlink Gap, and Keyword Gap.. It then consolidates the issues and action items into tailored recommendation cards, related to your keyword rankings, domain authority, organic competitors, and more. I use it to regularly check SEO recommendations and spot potential issues, such as with technical SEO or backlinks. When I see a recommendation or alert, I head to each specific tool to investigate it further: Pros Cons Makes it easy to prioritize action items for SEO performance Exclusive to Semrush users: not compatible with other tools Helps navigate the many tools in Semrush’s suite While the reports provide a lot of useful data, some users may want more in-depth summaries Offers daily alerts to keep you posted about real-time concerns Converts data into actionable insights in order of priority Clearscope is an AI content platform that helps with keyword research, content optimization, and analytics. The content optimization feature offers somewhat similar benefits to other AI content tools. But the workflow is different. When you add an existing URL and your target keyword, the tool will analyze the published page for you. It will then provide suggestions for improvement, such as: The tool also helps with topic research and generates basic SEO reports. For example, it tracks your ranking positions and provides high-level content analytics metrics. Pros Cons Automates the process of building content briefs and optimizing content More expensive than most SEO content creation tools and has no free trial Keep tabs on published content to find opportunities to refresh content Doesn’t offer many content creation possibilities Provides content analytics, which simplifies performance analysis Content analytics and keyword research tools are somewhat basic, and the content grade simply checks if you’ve covered all related keywords SurferSEO offers a suite of SEO tools to discover keywords, find content ideas, create outlines, optimize content, and more. Many content teams use it for content optimization. Similar to Clearscope, it analyzes the organic results for your target keywords and makes content structure recommendations. Surfer also offers some useful features for search engine optimizers, including a topical map, an SERP analyzer, and a content audit tool. A word of caution: I’d be careful with metrics like optimal content length and the recommended number of headings. While they might be useful suggestions, you’ll know best if they make sense for your particular content piece. Finally, while you can generate full articles, they each cost an additional $19, with a maximum of 30 articles on the cheapest plan. Pros Cons Easy to use when working with content writers, as it helps to track keywords in your drafts Might not be the best choice for beginners and folks looking for more automation as it involves more steps and requires more SEO experience Sleek and modern UI Limited credits make it difficult to use freely The Google Docs extension makes it easy to work anywhere The Google Docs extension can get a bit buggy Lots of data-driven tools useful for SEOs and content marketers The Content Editor doesn’t let you adjust your targets 💡 Find out who comes out on top in our ContentShake AI vs SurferSEO comparison. In the screenshot above, ChatGPT claims it can do a variety of SEO tasks. But I would take this with a pinch of salt. ChatGPT, along with other AI chatbots like Gemini and Claude, is amazing for brainstorming and analysis. But it doesn’t have any real-time SEO data and is not adapted for long-form content creation. So, I’d only use it together with an actual SEO tool that has access to SERP data. That said, ChatGPT is useful for other SEO tasks such as: Let’s look at an example. I downloaded a list of keywords from Semrush, uploaded the CSV file to ChatGPT, and asked it to group my keywords by category: Here’s the result: This is just one of many examples of how ChatGPT can save you time with SEO tasks—as long as you already have the data you need. Pros Cons Powerful AI with integrated data analysis features Doesn't offer real-time SEO data and specialized SEO output ChatGPT's best model (ChatGPT 4-o) is free for all users The interface is not optimized for long-form content creation Beginner-friendly interface and affordable price point Prone to factual errors and inaccurate responses 💡 Check out how ChatGPT compares to ContentShake AI. Copy.ai is an AI-powered automation platform with content creation tools for sales and marketing needs. Like other AI writing tools, it was originally used primarily for content creation. But it has recently shifted its focus towards automation. Copy.ai's new standout feature is its ability to create multi-step workflows for SEO processes. You can use the library of workflow templates for different use cases, such as writing a blog post, an SEO brief, and so on. The tool also lets you design custom workflows to automate different parts of your SEO setup. Here’s what it looks like: Pros Cons The unique workflow creation feature works great for enterprise SEO teams and large agencies with lots of processes It’s somewhat hard to use and might take a while to figure out Offers a sleek and modern UI Doesn’t offer any SEO data Integrates with 2,000+ tools SERP Gap Analyzer helps you discover low-difficulty keywords for your content plan. You can use it to find relevant keywords with higher search volume and less competition. This is especially helpful if you’re in a saturated niche and have to compete with lots of high-authority websites. Just enter your site and a seed topic to run an analysis. The tool then analyzes the search results for multiple relevant keywords and displays the ranking difficulty for each keyword. You can access other insights such as global search volume, SERP weaknesses, and more. Pros Cons Solves one of the key SEO pains—finding high-potential content topics Doesn’t integrate with most other SEO tools, except Semrush Generates briefs, outlines, and other content Can be a bit confusing to figure out Documents SERP analysis in detail to guide SEO efforts Perplexity is a conversational AI tool that’s connected to the Internet. It lets you parse the web, find information quickly, and conduct deep web research. Wondering why I included this tool in a list of SEO software? Because effective SEO is closely connected to quality content. And quality content needs fresh information and useful examples. I often use Perplexity to find out in minutes what could otherwise take hours of scouring web sources. For example: imagine I need to find an example of a content marketing campaign for small businesses for an article I’m writing. Perplexity will use various online sources and instantly suggest interesting ideas: Pros Cons Conducts image and video search There’s a limited number of questions that you can ask in a day on the free plan Organizes research with collections of multiple threads Limited to research and doesn’t serve very well for content creation Performs focused research on specific sites, such as YouTube, Reddit, etc. Sometimes hallucinates AI SEO tools use artificial intelligence to automate and fast-track SEO processes, such as keyword research, SERP analysis, and content creation. They can help you make better data-based decisions, increase productivity, and save time on routine tasks. Earlier this year, I surveyed over 2,500 small businesses and asked them about their experience with AI. And guess what? 68% of companies report higher SEO and content marketing ROI when using AI. There has been a lot of talk lately about Google “penalizing” AI-generated content. Let’s get this sorted once and for all. Google doesn’t care if it’s AI copy or not. It cares only about your content being genuine, useful, and relevant. Here’s what else they say: “Poor quality content isn't a new challenge for Google Search to deal with. We've been tackling poor quality content created both by humans and automation for years.” We’ve further proven that AI-generated content ranks nearly as well as human-written copy—as long as it offers value and original insights. I wouldn’t recommend relying solely on AI to create content for SEO and content creation. Why? Because AI doesn’t have the unique topical expertise that you need to create compelling content. But using AI as a tool to create content under your supervision and with your input? Or leveraging it to generate content ideas, cluster keywords, and analyze SEO data? Why not! That’s a wrap on my weeks of testing and shortlisting my favorite AI SEO tools. The key takeaway? Choose a tool that suits your specific needs and context. For example: Remember: there’s a limit to what AI tools can do. Use them to get rid of routine tasks, and to support your work, not replace it, and you won’t be disappointed.

Title: Did WhatsApp really need Meta?

Time Published: 2025-05-21T18:41:02Z

Cofounder Brian Acton butted heads with Meta before his departure, but took the stand as part of its defense. Cofounder Brian Acton butted heads with Meta before his departure, but took the stand as part of its defense. by Lauren Feiner In its antitrust case against Meta, the US Federal Trade Commission is asking a judge to consider an alternate reality. In that world, the company never bought Instagram and WhatsApp. The two apps remained competitive with Facebook, developing features that competed for users’ attention. And that competition created a thriving ecosystem of social media apps where people can connect with their friends and family. Meta has spent the past several days — during which it’s begun lodging its case-in-chief in a Washington, DC, courthouse — building a counternarrative. In its telling of this alternate present, Instagram and WhatsApp are shadows of what they are in our world. They lacked the resources, expertise, and vision to become robust and valuable online platforms, let alone formidable competitors. And consumers are the ones who ultimately suffered. One of Meta’s key witnesses for this defense is WhatsApp cofounder Brian Acton, who was called on Tuesday to help make its case that WhatsApp users, just like Instagram ones, benefited from Meta’s acquisition. Acton was the second app founder to testify in the case, after Instagram cofounder Kevin Systrom delivered mostly blistering testimony against the company a few weeks ago. Acton’s time on the stand came off less acrimonious, though both Meta and the FTC scored some key points. Acton was a striking witness for Meta to call given his high-profile departure from the company in 2017. The cofounder left $800 million in unvested restricted stock units on the table after butting heads with top Meta executives over putting ads in WhatsApp (when an FTC attorney pointed out the stock would have been worth $4 billion today, he joked, “please don’t say that,” but reassured himself it would only be $2 billion after taxes). The next year, he publicly advocated for people to delete Facebook in the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Acton reaffirmed that he had absolutely no interest in building a feed into WhatsApp But Acton backed up some important claims Meta has been making throughout the trial. Meta has repeatedly argued that WhatsApp was unlikely to compete with Facebook in the social networking space, so it wasn’t just trying to take out a potential rival. Acton reaffirmed that he and cofounder Jan Koum had absolutely no interest in building social features like a feed into WhatsApp, or changing the company into an ad-supported business — even if their pre-acquisition investors wished they would. While the FTC has argued that WhatsApp could have succeeded on its own or with a different parent company, Acton said he and Koum rebuffed other offers, and felt that Meta’s infrastructure helped it skip over substantial work it would have had to do otherwise. On cross-examination, however, the FTC got some important admissions from Acton. Using Meta’s infrastructure might have helped it skip some steps, but Acton testified that WhatsApp didn’t actually migrate to Meta’s data centers to ward off outages — and WhatsApp had been highly capable of finding technical support for the app already. Instead, he said, he and Koum wanted to make sure Meta would continue operating the app even after they left. Far from being a bare-bones messaging app without Meta’s help, Acton testified that WhatsApp had already added several features before the acquisition like group messaging, video and audio messaging, and location sharing — with plans to add even more. WhatsApp was already growing incredibly fast prior to the acquisition, doubling in size every 12 to 18 months — that growth rate stayed pretty consistent even after Meta bought it. Acton was confident that even without Meta, WhatsApp would have grown from the more than 400 million monthly active users prior to the deal to one billion in about 18 months. This echoed testimony from Systrom that Instagram would likely still be successful without the sale. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified earlier in trial that he was surprised at how little interest WhatsApp’s founders had in building something larger than a “lifestyle company.” But while Acton reaffirmed his disdain for an ad-supported model that could pump up revenue, he conceded that he agreed to sell to Meta without securing a firm commitment against deploying ads, and he understood Meta’s offer price was likely based partly on plans to do so. That seemed to support the idea that the founders could have been open to monetizing their product more than they let on — potentially growing it into a rival for Meta. WhatsApp might have been an even better product — one that flourished in more markets with stronger privacy protections — without Meta’s stewardship, the FTC suggested. In a November 2014 email, it pointed out, a WhatsApp employee told Acton and Koum that executives at its new owner had “some reservation” about promoting the app in countries where Facebook Messenger was already a leader. Meta successfully pressured WhatsApp to change its privacy policy and terms of service in 2016 so that Facebook could capitalize on user data for its ads product (unless WhatsApp users opted out). And it pushed for a business version of the app, something Acton said he was “adamantly against,” fearing it would dilute WhatsApp’s end-to-end encryption. After Acton left, the product launched.

Title: Tariff Truce and Liquidity Fuel Bitcoin to $109,000 All-Time High — What’s Next for BTC?
URL: https://zycrypto.com/tariff-truce-and-liquidity-fuel-bitcoin-to-109000-all-time-high-whats-next-for-btc/
Time Published: 2025-05-21T17:45:31Z

Bitcoin price rallied to a new all-time high above $109,000 on May 21, propelled by a sudden thaw in global trade tensions and expectations of looser monetary policy. The cryptocurrency traded around $109,369 on late trading, extending a rally that lifted prices about 6% in the past week. This move follows a breakthrough above $100,000 earlier in May, as investors responded to signs that President Trump’s global tariff offensive might be easing. The immediate catalyst was a surprise 90-day “tariff truce” between the United States and China. On May 12, officials in Geneva announced a pause on new levies and sharp rollbacks of existing duties, slashing reciprocal tariffs by roughly 115 percentage points to about 10%. Global markets leaped on the news: stock futures and Asian equities jumped, and commodity prices rallied on hopes of a broad trade-war détente. Bitcoin investors also took notice. Analysts note that the tariff pause removed the risk of ‘sudden re‑escalation’, which had been weighing on risk appetite. In other words, as the trade conflict eased, risk assets like Bitcoin rallied without the overhang of fresh tariffs. Broader macroeconomic conditions have added fuel to the crypto rally. Central banks worldwide are signaling easier policy. In the U.S., futures markets are now priced at multiple rate cuts this year, and a weaker dollar has coincided with renewed growth in global money supply. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank has maintained an accommodative stance, and the Bank of Japan continues massive asset purchases, reinforcing the loose global liquidity backdrop. China’s central bank has also begun pumping cash into markets. Such ample liquidity typically lifts risk assets, and Bitcoin has benefited accordingly. At the same time, institutional investors have been pouring into crypto. Hedge funds and asset managers have funneled record sums into spot-Bitcoin ETFs and futures, betting on higher prices. Leading figures in the crypto industry have expressed firm bullish conviction. Former PayPal and Meta executive David Marcus tweeted, “the bull case for Bitcoin has never been stronger,” citing easier custody solutions at banks and competition from sovereign and corporate buyers. Changpeng Zhao, co-founder of Binance, echoed this optimism. Analysts even project Bitcoin could reach around $150,000 if regulatory conditions remain favorable. Looking ahead, analysts are divided on just how far Bitcoin can climb. Some have raised year-end targets above $130,000. Jamie Coutts of Real Vision warns that the relentless expansion of fiat money means Bitcoin “may push…above $132,000” by late 2025. Even major banks have revised their models: Standard Chartered’s crypto research team recently suggested that a $120,000 second-quarter price target might be “too low”. On the other hand, many caution that the rally could pause or correct if global liquidity peaks or regulators tighten. Bitcoin’s price historically follows four-year “halving” cycles tied to new coin issuance, and some forecasters see the current monetary easing lasting through 2025. Those forces could cool Bitcoin’s momentum if central banks eventually reverse course or inflation spikes. For now, however, the rare alignment of easing trade tensions and abundant liquidity, coupled with growing institutional adoption, has set the stage for one of crypto’s strongest rallies.

Despite retail stocks weighing down the market, European stocks were little changed on Wednesday. General stocks gains limited the losses as investors reacted to changes in US taxation policies. The pan-European STOXX 600 closed slightly lower, down 0.8 per cent, as Dublin saw a marginal day of trading. Dublin While fallers outnumbered risers, the Iseq All-Share index ended the session slightly up 25.31 or 0.22 per cent from its previous close, at 11,399.48, its highest ever close. There was a mixed performance in the banking sector. Bank of Ireland rose 0.89 per cent to €11.995, following on from a strong performance on Tuesday. Fellow banking stocks, Permanent TSB dropped 0.58 per cent and AIB Group fell 0.45 per cent. Defensive stocks also had a mixed day of trading. While Kerry Group added 0.67 per cent, rising to a share price of €97.35, fellow dairy giant Glanbia fell 0.24 per cent. Healthcare services group Uniphar saw a 1 per cent fall in its share price. Ryanair, which rose 5 per cent after publishing financial results on Monday, saw a third consecutive rise this week adding 0.63 per cent, reaching €23.85 per share. London The FTSE 100 was nearly flat with a 0.06 per cent gain, while the midcap FTSE 250 fell 0.7 per cent, as the inflation data triggered a slight wobble on the more domestically-focused index. Among blue-chips, sportswear retailer JD Sports’ shares were the worst hit, dropping 10.6 per cent after it warned that President Donald Trump’s tariffs may force the company to hike prices in the key market. SSE fell 2.4 per cent after the renewable energy generator cut its five-year investment plans by 15 per cent. Keeping losses in check, precious metal miners gained 3 per cent as gold prices rose for a third straight session and hit a one-week high. Fresnillo gained the most in the FTSE 100 with 4.2 per cent rise. Water utility Severn Trent shares gained 2.3 per cent after it projected a doubling of adjusted earnings per share between 2025 to 2028. Europe The European benchmark shed 0.8 per cent amid declines in luxury and retail stocks. JD Sports fell 10.6 per cent to the bottom of the STOXX 600 after posting a 2 per cent drop in first-quarter underlying sales and warned that higher prices in its key U.S. market could hit customer demand. LVMH, Hermes and Kering among others fell over 2 per cent after luxury group Chanel reported a 4.3 per cent drop in its comparable yearly sales. Tech shares helped to outweigh these losses, German chipmaker Infineon’s 2.3 per cent gain after it said it would work with Nvidia to develop chips for new power delivery systems inside artificial intelligence data centres provided a boost to the sector. The STOXX 600, however, has recovered from its April slump, and is trading less than 3 per cent away from its all-time highs. An index tracking defence stocks was up 0.5 per cent after Trump selected a design for the $175 billion Golden Dome missile defence shield on Tuesday. Morgan Stanley raised its view on the European banking sector to “attractive”, citing better earnings potential from continued yield steepening. The European banks index is among the top performing sectors this year. Swiss bank Julius Baer slid 4.9 per cent after reporting a 130 million Swiss franc ($156.4 million) charge from a credit portfolio review and replacing its chief risk officer. New York In a volatile session on Wall Street, the S & P500 had slipped with Treasury yields rising in reaction to the US President Donald Trump’s proposed tax-cut law during mid afternoon trading. Boosting the Nasdaq, Google-parent Alphabet recorded a jump, while Nvidia and Meta Platforms climbed saw stocks rise slightly. Nine of the 11 S&P sub-sectors traded lower, with Healthcare being the worst hit. UnitedHealth Group saw its shares fall, following a Guardian report said the healthcare conglomerate secretly paid nursing homes thousands in bonuses to help reduce hospital transfers for ailing residents. HSBC also downgraded the stock to “reduce” from “hold”. In earnings, retailer Target fell after slashing its annual forecast due to a pullback in discretionary spending. Wolfspeed had lost nearly 70 per cent during mid afternoon trading following a report that the semiconductor supplier was preparing to file for bankruptcy within weeks. Despite the losses, U.S. stocks have had a solid month so far. The S&P 500 has climbed more than 17 per cent from its April lows, when Trump’s reciprocal tariffs roiled global markets. On the back of bitcoin recording a fresh all-time high of $109,481.83 (€96,460.61) during the session, exchange operator Coinbase gained alongside crypto miners such as Riot Platforms. – Additional reporting by Reuters.

Title: The Era of the Business Idiot

Fair warning: this is the longest thing I've written on this newsletter. I do apologize. Soundtrack: EL-P - $4 Vic Listen to my podcast Better Offline. We have merch. Last week, Bloomberg profiled Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, revealing that he's either a liar or a specific kind of idiot. The article revealed that — assume we believe him, and this wasn’t merely a thinly-veiled advert for Microsoft’s AI tech — Copilot consumes Nadella’s life outside the office as well at work. None of these tasks are things that require you to use AI. You can read your messages on Outlook and Teams without having them summarized — and I’d argue that a well-written email is one that doesn’t require a summary. Podcasts are not there "to be chatted about" with an AI. Preparing for meetings isn't something that requires AI, nor is research, unless, of course, you don't really give a shit about the actual content of what you're reading or the message of what you're saying, just that you are "saying the right thing." To be clear, I am deeply unconvinced that Nadella actually runs his life in this way, but if he does, Microsoft’s board should fire him immediately. In any case, the article is rambling, cloying, and ignores Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman's documented history of abusing his workers. Ten custom agents that do what? What do you mean by "other tasks"? Why are these questions never asked? Is it because the reporters know they won't get an answer? Is it because the reporters are too polite to ask more probing questions, knowing that these anecdotes are likely entirely made up as a means to promote a flagging AI ecosystem that cost billions to construct, but doesn’t really seem to do anything, and the reporter in question doesn’t want to force Satya to build a bigger house of cards than he needs to. Or is it because we, as a society, do not want to look too closely at the powerful? Is it because we've handed our economy to men that get paid $79 million a year to do a job they can't seem to describe, and even that, they would sooner offload to a bunch of unreliable AI models than actually do? We live in the era of the symbolic executive, when "being good at stuff" matters far less than the appearance of doing stuff, where "what's useful" is dictated not by outputs or metrics that one can measure but rather the vibes passed between managers and executives that have worked their entire careers to escape the world of work. Our economy is run by people that don't participate in it and our tech companies are directed by people that don't experience the problems they allege to solve for their customers, as the modern executive is no longer a person with demands or responsibilities beyond their allegiance to shareholder value. I, however, believe the problem runs a little deeper than the economy, which is a symptom of a bigger, virulent, and treatment-resistant plague that has infected the minds of those currently twigging at the levers of power — and really, the only levers that actually matter. The incentives behind effectively everything we do have been broken by decades of neoliberal thinking, where the idea of a company — an entity created to do a thing in exchange for money —has been drained of all meaning beyond the continued domination and extraction of everything around it, focusing heavily on short-term gains and growth at all costs. In doing so, the definition of a “good business” has changed from one that makes good products at a fair price to a sustainable and loyal market, to one that can display the most stock price growth from quarter to quarter. This is the Rot Economy, which is a useful description for how tech companies have voluntarily degraded their core products in order to placate shareholders, transforming useful — and sometimes beloved — services into a hollow shell of their former selves as a means of expressing growth. But it’s worth noting that this transformation isn’t constrained to the tech industry, nor was it a phenomena that occurred when the tech industry entered its current VC-fuelled, publicly-traded incarnation. In The Shareholder Supremacy, I drew a line from an early 20th-century court ruling, to former General Electric CEO Jack Welch, to the current tech industry, but there’s one figure I didn’t pay as much attention to, and I regrettably now have to do so. Famed Chicago School economist (and dweller of Hell) Milton Friedman once argued in his 1970 doctrine that those who didn’t focus on shareholder value were “unwitting pup­pets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society these past decades," and that any social responsibility — say, treating workers well, doing anything other than focus on shareholder value — is tantamount to an executive taxing his shareholders by "spending their money" on their own personal beliefs. Friedman was a fundamentalist when it came to unrestricted, unfettered capitalism, and this zealotry surpassed any sense of basic human morality — if he had any — at times. For example, in his book, Capitalism and Friedman, he argued that companies should be allowed to discriminate on racial grounds because the owner might suffer should they be required to hire an equally or better-qualified Black person. Bear in mind, this was written at the height of the civil rights movement, just six years before the assassination of Martin Luther King, and when America was rapidly waking up to the evils of racism and segregation (a process, I add, is ongoing and sadly not complete). This is a direct quote: Friedman was grotesque. I am not religious, but I hope Hell exists if only for him. The broader point I’m trying to make is that neoliberalism is inherently selfish, believing that the free market should reign supreme, bereft of government intervention, regulation or interference, thinking that somehow these terms will enable "freedom" rather than a kind of market-dominated quasi-dictatorship where our entire lives are dominated by the whims of the affluent, and that there is no institution that can possibly push back against them. Friedman himself makes the facile argument that economic freedom — which, he says, is synonymous with unfettered capitalism — is a necessary condition of unfettered political freedom. Obviously, that’s bollocks, although it’s an argument that’s proven persuasive with a certain class of people that are either intellectually or morally hollow (or both). Neoliberalism also represents a kind of modern-day feudalism, dividing society based on whether someone is a shareholder or not, with the former taking precedence and the latter seen as irrelevant at best, or disposable at worst. It’s curious that Friedman saw economic freedom — a state that is non-interventionist in economic matters — as essential for political freedom, while also failing to see equality as the same. I realize this is all very big and clunky, but I want you to understand how these incentives have fundamentally changed everything, and why they are responsible for the rot we see in our society and our workplaces. When your only incentive is shareholder value, and you raise shareholder value as a platonic ideal, everything else is secondary, including the customer you are selling something to. Friedman himself makes a moral case for discrimination, because shareholder value — in his example, the store owner — matters more than racial equality at its most basic level. When you care only about shareholder value, the only job you have is to promote further exploitation and dominance — not to have happy customers, not to make your company "a good place to work," not to make a good product, not to make a difference or contribute to anything other than further growth. While this is, to anyone with a vapor of an intellectual or moral dimension, absolutely fucking stupid, it’s an idea that’s proven depressingly endemic among the managerial elite, in part because it has entered the culture, and because it is hammered across in MBA classes and corporate training seminars. In simpler terms, modern business theory trains executives not to be good at something, or to make a company based on their particular skills, but to "find a market opportunity" and exploit it. The Chief Executive — who makes over 300 times more than their average worker — is no longer a leadership position, but a kind of figurehead measured on their ability to continually grow the market capitalization of their company. It is a position inherently defined by its lack of labor, the amorphousness of its purpose and its lack of any clear responsibility. While CEOs do get fired when things go badly, it's often after a prolonged period of decline and stagnancy, and almost always comes with some sort of payoff — and when I say "badly," I mean that growth has slowed to the point that even firing masses of people doesn't make things better. We have, as a society, reframed all business leadership — which is increasingly broad, consisting of all management from the C-suite down — to be the equivalent of a mall cop, a person that exists to make sure people are working without having any real accountability for the work themselves, or to even understand the work itself. When the leader of a company doesn't participate in or respect the production of the goods that enriches them, it creates a culture that enables similarly vacuous leaders on all levels. Management as a concept no longer means doing "work," but establishing cultures of dominance and value extraction. A CEO isn't measured on happy customers or even how good their revenue is today, but how good revenue might be tomorrow and whether those customers are paying them more. A "manager," much like a CEO, is no longer a position with any real responsibility — they're there to make sure you're working, to know enough about your work that they can sort of tell you what to do, but somehow the job of "telling you what to do" doesn't come with it any actual work, and the instructions don’t need to be useful or even meaningful. Decades of direct erosion of the very concept of leadership means that the people running companies have been selected not based on their actual efficacy — especially as the position became defined by its lack of actual production — but on whether they resemble what a manager or executive is meant to look like based on the work that somebody else did. That’s how someone like David Zaslav, a lawyer by trade and arguably the worst CEO in the entertainment industry, managed to become the head of Warner Brothers (that, and kissing up to Jack Welch, who he called a “big brother” that “picked him up like a friend”). It’s how Carly Fiorina — an MBA by trade — went on to become the head of HP, only to drive the company into a ditch where it stopped innovating, and largely missed the biggest opportunities of the early Internet era. The three CEOs that followed (Mark Hurd (who was ousted after fudging expense reports to send money to a love interest and still got tens of millions of dollars in severance), Leo Apotheker (who the New York Times suggests may have been worse than Fiorina), and Meg Whitman (famous for being a terrible CEO at HP and co-founding doomed video startup Quibi) similarly came from a non-tech background, and similarly did a shitty job, in part because they didn’t understand the company or the products or the customers. Management has, over the course of the past few decades, eroded the very fabric of corporate America, and I'd argue it’s done the same in multiple other western economies, too. I’d also argue that this kind of dumb management thinking also infected the highest echelons of politics across the world, and especially in the UK, my country of birth and where I lived until 2011, delivering the same kind of disastrous effects but at a macro level, as they impacted not a single corporate entity but the very institutions of the state. I’m not naive. I don’t think that the average politician is a salt-of-the-earth type, someone who did a normal job and then decided to enter politics. Especially not in the UK, where the trappings of class permeate everything, and we’re yet to shake off the noxious influence of the aristocracy and constitutionally-mandated hereditary privilege. Our political elite often comes from one of two universities (Oxford and Cambridge, the alma mater of 20% of current UK Members of Parliament) and a handful of fee-paying schools (like Eton, which is a hellmouth for the worst people to ever exist, and educated 20 of the UK’s 55 prime ministers). The UK has never been an egalitarian society. And yet, things have changed markedly in the past few decades.The difference between now and then is that the silver-spooned elite was, whether because they believed it or because it was politically expedient, not totally contemptuous of those at the bottom of the economic ladder. I was born in the midst of the Thatcher government, and my formative years were spent as British society tried to restructure itself after her reforms. Thatcher, famously, was an acolyte of the Friedman school of thought, and spent her nearly twelve years in office dismantling the state and pushing the culture towards an American-style individualism, once famously quipping that there was “no such thing as society.” She didn’t understand how things worked, but was nonetheless completely convinced of the power of the market to handle what was the functions of the state — from housing to energy and water. The end result of this political and cultural shift was, in the long run, disastrous. The UK has the smallest houses in the OECD, the smallest housing stock of any developed country, and some of the worst affordability. The privatization of the UK’s water infrastructure meant that money that would previously go towards infrastructure upgrades was, instead, funnelled to shareholders in the form of dividends. As a result, Britain is literally unable to process human waste and is actively dumping millions of liters of human sewage into its waterways and coastline. When Britain privatized its energy companies, the new management sold or closed the vast majority of its gas storage infrastructure. As a result, when the Ukraine War sparked, and natural gas prices surged, Britain had some of the smallest reserves of any country in Europe, and was forced to buy gas at the market prices — which were several times higher than their pre-war levels. I’m no fan of Thatcher, and like Friedman, I too wish hell exists, if only for the both of them. I wrote the above to emphasize the consequences of this clueless managerial thinking on a macro level — where the impacts aren’t just declining tech products or white-collar layoffs, but rather the emergence of generational crises in housing, energy, and the environment. These crises were obvious consequences of decisions made by someone whose belief in the free market was almost absolute, and whose fundamentalist beliefs surpassed the actual informed understanding of those working in energy, or housing, or water. As the legendary advertiser Stanley Pollitt once said, “bullshit baffles brains.” The sweeping changes we’ve seen, both in our economy and in our society, has led to an unprecedented, gilded age of bullshit where nothing matters, and things — things of actual substance — matter nothing. We live in a symbolic economy where we apply for jobs, writing CVs and cover letters to resemble a certain kind of hire, with our resume read by someone who doesn't do or understand our job, but yet is responsible for determining whether we’re worthy of going to the next step of the hiring process. All this so that we might get an interview with a manager or executive who will decide whether they think we can do it. We are managed by people whose job is implicitly not to do work, but oversee it. We are, as children (and young adults), encouraged to aspire to become a manager or executive, to "own our own business," to "have people that work for us," and the terms of our society are, by default, that management is not a role you work at, so much as a position you hold — a figurehead that passes the buck and makes far more of them than you do. This problem, I believe, has poisoned the fabric of almost every part of modern business, elevating people that don't do work to oversee companies that make things they don't understand, creating substrates of management that do not do anything but create further distance from actually doing a job. While some of you might automatically think I'm talking about Graeber's concept of Bullshit Jobs, this is far, far bigger. The system as it stands selects people at all levels of management specifically because they resemble the kind of specious, work-averse dullard that runs seemingly every company — a person built to go from meeting to meeting with the vague consternation that suggests they're "busy." As a result, the higher you get up in an organization, the further you get from the customer, the problem you've solving, and any of the actual work, and the higher up you get, the more power you have to change the conditions of the business. On some level, modern corporate power structures are a giant game of telephone where vibes beget further vibes, where managers only kind-of-sort-of understand what's going on, and the more vague one's understanding is, the more likely you are to lean toward what's good, or easy, or makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside. The system selects for people comfortable in these roles, creating org charts full of people that become harder and harder to justify other than "they've been here a while." They do not do "work" on the "product," and their answer as to why would be "what, am I meant to go down on the line and use a machine?" or "am I meant to call a customer and make a sale?" and the answer is yes, you lazy fucking piece of shit, you should do that once in a while, or at the very least go and watch or listen to somebody else do so, and do so regularly. But that's not what a manager does, right? Management isn't work, it's about thinking really hard and telling people what to do. It's about making the calls. It's about "managing people," and that can mean just about anything, but often means "who do I take credit from or pass blame to," because modern management has been stripped of all meaning other than continually reinforcing power structures for the next manager up. This system creates products for these people, because these people are more often than not the ones in power — they are your boss, your boss' boss, and their boss too. Big companies build products sold by specious executives or managers to other specious executives, and thus the products themselves stop resembling things that solve problems so much as they resemble a solution. After all, the person buying it — at least at the scale of a public company — isn’t necessarily the recipient of the final product, so they too are trained (and selected) to make calls based on vibes. I believe the scale of this problem is society-wide, and it is, at its core, a destruction of what it means to be a leader, and a valorization of selfishness, isolationist thinking, turning labor into a faceless resource, which naturally leads to seeing customers in an equally faceless way, their problems generalized, their pain points viewed as parts of a powerpoint rather than anything that your company earnestly tries to solve or even really thinks about. And that assumes that said pain points are even considered to begin with, or not ignored in favor of a fictitious and purely hypothetical pain point. People — be they the ones you're paying or paying you — become numbers. We have created and elevated an entirely new class of person, the nebulous "manager," and told decades-worth of children that's what they should aspire to, that the next step from doing a job is for us to tell other people to do a job, until we're able to one day tell those people how to do their job, with each rung on the corporate ladder further distancing ourselves from anything that interacts with reality. The real breaking point is fairly simple: the higher up you go at a company, the further you are from problems or purpose. Everything is abstract — the people that work for you, the people you work for, and even the tasks you do. We train people — from a young age! — to generalize and distance oneself from actual tasks, to aspire to doing managerial work, because managers are well-paid and "know what's going on," even if they haven't actually known what was going on for years, if they ever did so. This phenomenon has led to the stigmatization of blue-collar work (and the subsequent evisceration of practical trade and technical education across most of the developed world) in favor of universities. Society respects an MBA more than a plumber, even though the latter benefits society more — though I concede that both roles involve, on some level, shit, with the plumber unblocking it and the MBA spewing it. I believe this process has created a symbolic society — one where people are elevated not by any actual ability to do something or knowledge they may have, but by their ability to make the right noises and look the right way to get ahead. The power structures of modern society are run by business idiots — people that have learned enough to impress the people above them, because the business idiots have had power for decades. They have bred out true meritocracy or achievement or value-creation in favor of symbolic growth and superficial intelligence, because real work is hard, and there are so many of them in power they've all found a way to work together. I need you to understand how widespread this problem is, because it is why everything feels fucking wrong. Think of the Business Idiot as a kind of con artist, except the con has become the standard way of doing business for an alarmingly large part of society. The Business Idiot is the manager that doesn't seem to do anything but keeps being promoted, and the chief executive officer of a public company that says boring, specious nonsense about AI. They're the tenured professor that you wish would die, the administrator whose only job appears to be opening and closing their laptop, the consultant that can come up with a million reasons to charge you more money yet not one metric to judge their success by, the marketing executive that's worked exactly three years at every major cloud player but does not appear to have done anything, and the investor that invests "based on founders," but really means "guys that look at sound exactly like them." These people are present throughout the private and public sector, and our governments too, and they paradoxically do nothing of substance, but somehow damage everything they touch. This isn’t to say our public and private sector is entirely useless — just that these people have poisoned so many parts of our power structures that avoiding them is impossible. Our economy is oriented around them — made easier and more illogical for their benefit — because their literal only goal in life has been to take and use power. The Business Idiot is also an authoritarian, and will do whatever they need to — including harming the institution they work for, or those closest to them, like their co-workers or their community — as a means of avoiding true accountability or responsibility. Decades of neoliberalism has incentivized their rise, because when you incentivize society to become management — to "manage or run a company" rather than do something for a reason or purpose — you are incentivizing a kind of corporate narcissism, one that bleeds into whatever field the person goes into, be it public or private. We go to college as a means of getting a job after college using the grades we got in college, rendering many students desperate to get the best grades they can versus "learn" anything, because our economy is riddled with power structures controlled by people that don't know stuff and find it offensive when you remind them. Our society is in the thrall of dumb management, and functions as such. Every government, the top quarter of every org chart, features little Neros who, instead of battling the fire engulfing Rome, are sat in their palaces strumming an off-key version of “Wonderwall” on the lyre and grumbling about how the firefighters need to work harder, and maybe we could replace them with an LLM and a smart sprinkler system. Every institution keeps its core constituents and labor forces at arms-length, and effectively anything built at scale quickly becomes distanced from both the customer and laborer. This disconnection — or alienation — sits at the center of almost every problem I've ever talked about. Why would companies push generative AI in seemingly every part of their service, even though customers don't like it and it doesn't really work? It's simple: they neither know nor care what the customer wants, barely know how their businesses function, barely know what their products do, and barely understand what their workers are doing, meaning that generative AI feels magical, because it does an impression of somebody doing a job, which is an accurate way of describing how most executives and middle managers operate. Let me get a little more specific. An IBM study based on conversations with 2,000 global CEOs recently found that only 25% of AI initiatives have delivered their expected ROI over the last few years, and, worse still, "64% of CEOs surveyed acknowledge that the risk of falling behind drives investment in some technologies before they have a clear understanding of the value they bring to the organization." 50% of respondents also found that "the pace of recent investments has left their organization with disconnected, piecemeal technology," almost as if they don't know what they're doing and are just putting AI in stuff for no reason. Johnson & Johnson recently decided to "shift from broad generative AI experimentation to a focused approach on high-value use cases" according to the Wall Street Journal, adding that "only 10 to 15% of use cases were driving about 80% of the value." Their last two CEOs (Alex Gorsky and Joaquin Duato) both have MBAs, with current CEO Duato's previous ten years at Johnson & Johnson being "some sort of Chairman or Vice President," and the previous two CEOs (Alex Gorsky and William Weldon) were both pharmaceutical sales and marketing people. Fun fact about Alex Gorsky! During his first tenure at Johnson & Johnson he led marketing of products that deliberately underplayed some drugs' side effects and paid off the largest nursing home pharmacy in America to sell more drugs to old people. The term "executive" loosely refers to a person who moves around numbers and hopes for the best. The modern executive does not "lead," but prod, their managers hall monitors for organizations run predominantly by people that, by design, are entirely removed from the business itself even in roles like marketing and sales, where CMOs and VPs bark orders without really participating in the process. We talk eagerly about how young people in entry level jobs should "earn their stripes" by doing "grunt work," and that too is the neoliberal poison in the veins of our society, because, by definition, your very first experience of the workforce is working hard enough so that you don't have to work as hard. And anyway, the same managerial types who bitch about the entitlement and unrealistic expectations of young people are the same ones that also eviscerated the bottom rung of the career ladder — typically by offshoring many of these roles, or consolidating them into the responsibilities of their increasingly burned-out senior workers — or see AI as a way to eliminate what they see as an optional cost center, and not the future of their workforce. Society berated people for "quiet quitting," a ghastly euphemism for “doing the job as specified in your employment contract,” in 2022 because journalism is enthralled by the management class, and because the management class has so thoroughly rewritten the concept of what "labor" means that people got called lazy for literally doing their jobs. The middle manager brain doesn't see a worker as somebody hired and paid for a job, but as an asset that must provide a return. As a result, if another asset comes along that could potentially provide a bigger return — like an offshore worker, or an AI agent — that middle manager won’t hesitate to drop them. Artificial intelligence is the ultimate panacea for the Business Idiot — a tool that gives an impression of productivity with far more production than the Business Idiot themselves. The Information reported recently that ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott — the chief executive of a company with a market capitalization of over $200 billion, despite the fact that, like SalesForce, nobody really knows what it does — chose to push AI across his whole organization (both in product and in practice) based on the mental consideration I'd usually associate with a raven finding a shiny object: You'll notice that all of this is complete nonsense. What do you mean "efficiency"? What does that quote even mean? 110% of plan? What're you on about? Did you hit your head on something Bill? I'd wager Bill is concussion-free — and an example of a true Business Idiot — a person with incredible power and wealth that makes decisions not based on knowing stuff or caring about his customers, but on the latest shiny thing that makes him think "line go up." No, really, that's Bill McDermott's thing. Back in 2022, he said to Yahoo Finance the metaverse was "real" and that ServiceNow could help someone "create an e-mall in the metaverse" and have a futuristic store of some sort. One might wonder how ServiceNow provided that, and the answer is it didn't. I cannot find a single product that it’s offered that includes it. Bill, like any of these CEOs, doesn't really know stuff, or even do stuff, he just is. The corporate equivalent of a stain on a carpet that nobody really knows how it got there, but hasn’t been removed. The modern executive is symbolic, and the media has — due to the large amount of Business Idiots running these outlets and middle managers stuffed into the editorial class — been trained to never ask difficult questions, such as "what the fuck are you talking about, Bill?" or even the humble "what does that mean?" or "how would you do that?" or saying "I'm not sure I understand, would you mind explaining?" Perhaps the last part is the symptom of the overall problem. So many layers of editorial and managerial power are filled full of people that don't know anything, and there's never anyone crueler about ignorance than somebody that's ignorant themselves. Worse still, in many fields — journalism included — we are rarely rewarded for knowing things or being "right," but being right in the way that keeps the people with the keys from scraping them across our cars. We are, however, rewarded for saying the right thing at the right time, which more often than not means resembling our (white, male) superiors, speaking like our peers, and delivering results in the way that makes everybody feel happiest. A great example of our vibes-based society was back in October 2021, where a Washington Post article written by two Harvard professors rallied against remote work by citing a Microsoft-funded anti-remote study and quoting 130-year-old economist Alfred Marshall about how "workers gather in dense clusters," ignoring the fact that Marshall was so racist they've had to write papers about it, how excited he was about eugenics, or the fact he was writing about fucking factories. Remote work terrifies the Business Idiot, because it removes the performative layer that allowed them to stomp around and feel important, reducing their work to, well...work. Office culture is inherently heteronormative and white, and black women are less likely to be promoted by their managers, and continuing the existence of "The Office" is all about making sure The Business Idiot reigns supreme. Removing the ability for the managerial hall monitors to look at you and try and work out what you're doing without ever really helping is a big part of being a manager — and if you're a manager reading this and saying you don't do this, I challenge you to talk to another person that doesn't confirm your biases. The Business Idiot reigns supreme. Their existence holds up almost every public company, and remote work was the first time they willingly raised their heads. Google demanded employees return to the office in 2021 — but let one executive work remotely from New Zealand because absolutely none of the decisionmaking was done with people that actually do work. While we can (well, you can, I'm not interested) debate whether exclusively working remote is as productive, the Return To Office push was almost entirely done in two ways: The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and many, many other outlets all fell for this crap because the Business Idiots have captured our media too, training even talented journalists to defer to power at every turn. When every power structure is stuffed full of do-nothing management types that have learned exactly as little as they need to as a means to get by, it's inevitable that journalism caters to them — specious, thoughtless reproductions of the powerful's ideas. Look at the coverage of AI, or the metaverse, or cryptocurrency, or Clubhouse. Look at how willingly reporters will accept narratives not based on practical experience or what the technology can do, but what the powerful (and the popular) are suddenly interested in. Every single tech bubble followed the same path, and that path was paved with flawed, deferential and specious journalism, from small blogs to the biggest mastheads. Look at how reporters talk to executives — not just the way they ask things (like Nilay Patel's 100+ word questions to Sundar Pichai in his abominable interview), but the things they accept them saying, and the willingness reporters have to just accept what they're told. Satya Nadella is the CEO of a company with a market capitalization of over $3 trillion. I have no idea how you, as a reporter, do not say "Satya, what the fuck? You're outsourcing most of your life to generative AI? That's insane!" or even "do you really do that?" and then asking further questions. But that would get you in trouble. The editorial class is the managerial class now, and has spent decades mentoring young reporters to not ask questions, to not push back, to believe that a big, strong, powerful company CEO would never mislead them. Kara Swisher's half-assed interviews are considered "daring" and "critical" because journalism has, at large, lost its teeth, breeding reporters rewarded for knowing a little bit about a few things and punishing those who ask too many questions or refuse to fall in line. The reason they don't want you to ask these questions is that the Business Idiot isn't big on answers. Editors that tell you not to push too hard are doing so because they know the executive likely won't have an answer. It isn't just about the PR person that trained them, but the fact that these men more often than not have only a glancing understanding of their underlying business. Yet in the same way that Business Idiots penetrated every other part of society, they eventually found their way to journalism. While we can (and should) scream at the disconnected idiots that ran Vice into the ground, the problem is everywhere, because the Business Idiots aren't just at the top, but infecting the power structures underlying every newsroom. While there are many really great editors, there are plenty more that barely understand the articles they edit, the stories they commission, or that make reporters pull punches for fear of advertiser blowback. That, and mentorship is dead across effectively all parts of society, meaning that most reporters (as with many jobs) learn by watching each other, which means they all make sure to not ask the rough questions, and not push too hard against the party/market/company messaging until everybody else does it. And under these conditions, Business Idiots thrive. The Business Idiot's reign is one of speciousness and shortcuts, of acquisition, of dominance and of theft. Mentoring people is something you do to pass on knowledge — it may make them grateful to you, but it ultimately, in the mind of a Business Idiot, creates a competitor or rival. Investing in talent, or worker conditions, or even really work itself would require you to know what you're talking about, or actually do work, which doesn't make sense when you're talking to a worker. They're the ones who're meant to work! You're there to manage them! Yet they keep talking back — asking questions about the work you want them to do, asking you to step in and help on something — and all of that's so annoying. Just know the stuff already! Get it done! I have to go to lunch and then go back out to another lunch! I believe this is the predominant mindset across most of the powerful, to the point that everything in the world is constructed to reaffirm their beliefs rather than follow any logical path. Our stock market is inherently illogical, driven not by whether a company is good or bad, but whether it can show growth, even if said growth is horrifically unprofitable, and I'd argue it's because the market has no idea how to make intelligent decisions, just complex ones that mean that you don't really need to understand the business so much as you understand the associated vibes of the industry. Friedman's influence and Reagan's policies have allowed our markets to be dominated by Business Idiocy, where a bad company can be a good stock because everybody (IE: other traders and the business press) likes how it looks, which allows the Business Idiots to continue making profit using illogical and partially-rigged market-making, with the business press helpfully pushing up their narratives. This also keeps regular people from accumulating too much wealth — if regular people could set the tone for the markets as "a company that makes something people like and people pay them for it and they make more money than they spend," that might make things a little too even. It doesn't matter that CoreWeave quite literally does not have enough money for its capital expenditures and lost over $300m in the last quarter because its year-over-year growth was 420%. It doesn't matter that it has October loan payments that will crush the life out of the company either. These narratives are fed to the media knowing that the media will print them, because thinking too hard about a stock would mean the Business Idiot had to think also, and that is not why they are in this business. The "AI trade" is the Business Idiot's nirvana — a fascination for a managerial class that long since gave up any kind of meaningful contribution to the bottom line, as moving away from the fundamental creation of value as a business naturally leads to the same kind of specious value that one finds from generative AI. I’m not even saying that there’s no returns, or that LLMs don’t do anything, or even that there’s no possible commercial use for generative AI. They just don’t do enough, almost by design, and we’re watching companies desperately try and contort them into something, anything that works, pretending so fucking hard they’ll stake their entire futures on the idea. Just fucking work, will you? Agentforce doesn’t make any money, it sucks, but god damn is Marc Benioff going to make you bear witness. Does it matter that Agentforce doesn't make Salesforce any money? No! Because Benioff and Salesforce have got rich selling to fellow Business Idiots who then shove Salesforce into their organization without thinking about who would use it or how they'd use it other than in the most general ways. Agentforce was — and is — a fundamentally boring and insane product, charging $2 a conversation for a chatbot that, to quote The Information, provides customers with "...incorrect answers — AI hallucinations — while testing how the software handles customer service queries." But this shit is catnip to the Business Idiot, because the Business Idiot ideally never has to deal with work, workers or customers. Generative AI doesn’t do enough to actually help us be better at our jobs, but it gives a good enough impression of something useful so that it can convince someone really stupid that doesn’t understand what you do that they don’t need you, sometimes. A generative output is a kind of generic, soulless version of production, one that resembles exactly how a know-nothing executive or manager would summarise your work. OpenAI's "Deep Research" wows professional Business Idiot Ezra Klein because he doesn't seem to realize that part of research is the research itself, not just the output, as you learn about stuff as you research a topic, allowing you to come to a conclusion. The concept of an "agent" is the erotic dream of the managerial sect — a worker that they can personally command to generate product that they can say is their own, all without ever having to know or do anything other than the bare minimum of keeping up appearances, which is the entirety of the Business Idiot's resume. And because the Business Idiot's career has been built on only knowing exactly enough to get by, they don't dig into Large Language Models any further than hammering away at ChatGPT and saying "we must put AI in everything now." Yet the real problem is that for every Business Idiot selling a product, there are many more that will buy it, which has worked in the past for Software as a Service (SaaS) companies that grew fat and happy hocking giant annual contracts and continual upsells, because CIOs and CTOs work for Business Idiot CEOs that demand that they "put AI in everything now," a nonsensical and desperate remit that's part growth-lust and part ignorance, borne of the fear that one gets when they're out of their depth. Look at every single institution installing some sort of ChatGPT integration, and then look for the Business Idiot. Perhaps it's Cal State University Chanceller Mildred Garcia, who claimed that giving everybody a ChatGPT subscription would "elevate...students' educational experience across all fields of study, empower [its] faculty's teaching and research, and help provide the highly educated workforce that will drive California's future AI-driven economy," a nonsensical series of words to justify a $16.9 million-a-year single-vendor no-bid contract to a product that is best known as either a shitty search engine or a way to cheat at college. In some ways, Sam Altman is the Business Idiot's antichrist, taking advantage of a society where the powerful rarely know much other than what they want to control or dominate. ChatGPT and other AI tools are, for the most part, sold based on what they might do in the future to people that will never really use them, and Altman has done well to manipulate, pester and terrify those in power with the idea that they might miss out on something. Does anyone know what it is? No, they don't, because the powerful are Business Idiots too, willing to accept anything that somebody brings along that makes them feel good, or bad in a way that they can make headlines with. In any case, Altman's whole Sloppenheimer motif has worked wonders on the Business Idiots in the markets and global governments that fear what artificial intelligence could do, even if they can't really define artificial intelligence, or what it could do, or what they're scared of. The fear of China's "rise in AI" is one partially based on sinophobia, and partially based on the fact that China has their own Business Idiots willing to shove hundreds of millions of dollars into data centers. Generative AI has created a reckoning between the Business Idiot and the rest of society, its forced adoption and proliferation providing a meager return for the massive investment of capital and the revulsion it causes in many people, not just in the Business Idiot's excitement in replacing them, but how wrong the Business Idiot is. While there are many people that dick around with ChatGPT, years since it launched we still can't find a clean way to say what it does or why it matters other than the fact that everybody agreed it did. The media, now piloted by Business Idiots, has found itself declawed, its reporters unprepared, unwilling and unsupported, the backbone torn out of most newsrooms for fear that being too critical is somehow "not being objective," despite the fact that what you choose to cover objectively is still subjective. Reporters still, to this day, as these companies burn billions of dollars to make an industry the size of the free-to-play gaming industry, refuse to say things that bluntly because "the cost of inference is coming down" and "these companies have some of the smartest people in the world." They ignore the truth as it sits in front of them — that the combined annual recurring revenue of The Information's comprehensive database of every generative AI company is less than $10 billion, or $4 billion if you remove Anthropic and OpenAI. ChatGPT's popularity is the ultimate Business Idiot success story — the "fastest growing product in Silicon Valley history" that didn't grow because it was useful, or good, or able to do anything in particular, but because a media controlled by Business Idiots decided it was "the next big thing" and started talking about it nonstop since November 2022, guaranteeing that everybody would try it, even if even to this day the company can't really explain what it is you're meant to use it for. Much like the Business Idiot themselves, ChatGPT doesn't need to do anything specific. It just needs to make the right sounds at the right times to impress people that barely care what it does other than make them feel futuristic. Real people — regular people, not Business Idiots, not middle managers, not executive coaches, not MBAs, not CEOs — have seen this for what it was early and often, but real people are seldom the ones with the keys, and the media — even the people writing good stuff — regularly fails to directly and clearly say what's going on. The media is scared of doing the wrong thing — of "getting in trouble" with someone for "misquoting them" or "misreading what they said" — and in a society where in-depth knowledge is subordinate to knowing enough catchphrases, the fight often doesn't feel worth it even with an editor's blessing. I also want to be clear that this goes far beyond money. Editors aren't just scared of advertisers being upset. They know that if narratives have to shift toward more critical, thoughtful coverage, they too will have to be more thoughtful and knowledgeable, which is rough when you are a Business Idiot and got there by editing the right people in a way that didn't help them in the slightest. Nothing about what I'm saying should suggest the Business Idiot is weak. In fact, Business Idiots are fully in control — we have too many managers, and our most powerful positions are valorized for not knowing stuff, for having a general view that can "take the big picture," not realizing that a big picture is usually made up of lots of little brush strokes. Yet there are, eventually, consequences for everything being controlled by Business Idiots. Our current society — an unfair, unjust one dominated by half-broken tech products that make their owners billions — is the real punishment wrought by growth, a brain drain in corporate society, one that leads it to doing illogical things and somehow making money. It doesn't make any fucking sense that generative AI got this big. The returns aren't there, the outcomes aren't there, and any sensible society would've put a gun to a ChatGPT and aggressively pulled the trigger. Instead it's the symbolic future of capitalism — one that celebrates mediocrity and costs billions of dollars, every human work it can consume, and the destruction of our planet, all because everybody has kind of agreed that this is what they're all doing, with nobody able to give a convincing explanation of what that even is. Generative AI is revolting both in how overstated its abilities are and in how it continually tests how low a standard someone will take for a product, both in its outputs and in the desperate companies trying to integrate it into everything, and its proliferation throughout society and organizations is already fundamentally harmful. We’re not just drowning in a sea of slop — we’re in a constant state of corporate AI beta tests, new “features” sprouting out of our products like new limbs that sometimes function normally but often attempt to strangle us. It’s unclear if companies forcing these products on us have contempt for us or simply don’t know what good looks like. Or perhaps it's both, with the Business Idiot resenting us for not scarfing down whatever they serve us, as that's what's worked before. They don't really understand their customers — they understand what a customer pays for and how a purchase is made, you know, like the leaders of banks and asset managers during the subprime mortgage crisis didn't really think about whether people could pay those mortgages, just that they needed a lot of them to put in a CDO. The Business Idiot's economy is one built for other Business Idiots. They can only make things that sell to companies that must always be in flux — which is the preferred environment of the Business Idiot, because if they're not perpetually starting new initiatives and jumping on new "innovations," they'd actually have to interact with the underlying production of the company. Does the software work? Sometimes! Do successful companies exist that sell like this? Sure! But look at today's software and tell me with a straight face that things feel good to use. And something like generative AI was inevitable: an industry claiming to change the world that never really does so, full of businesses that don’t function as businesses, full of flimflam and half-truths used to impress people who will likely never interact with it, or do so in only a passing way. By chasing out the people that actually build things in favour of the people that sell them, our economy is built on production puppetry — just like generative AI, and especially like ChatGPT. These people are antithetical to what’s good in the world, and their power deprives us of happiness, the ability to thrive, and honestly any true innovation. The Business Idiot thrives on alienation — on distancing themselves from the customer and the thing they consume, and in many ways from society itself. Mark Zuckerberg wants us to have fake friends, Sam Altman wants us to have fake colleagues, and an increasingly loud group of executives salivate at the idea of replacing us with a fake version of us that will make a shittier version of what we make for a customer that said executive doesn’t fucking care about. They’re building products for other people that don’t interact with the real world. We are no longer their customers, and so, we’re worth even less than before — which, as is the case in a world dominated by shareholder supremacy, not all that much. They do not exist to make us better — the Business Idiot doesn’t really care about the real world, or what you do, or who you are, or anything other than your contribution to their power and wealth. This is why so many squealing little middle managers look up to the Musks and Altmans of the world, because they see in them the same kind of specious corporate authoritarian, someone above work, and thinking, and knowledge. One of the most remarkable things about the Business Idiot is their near-invulnerability. Modern management is resource control, shifting blame away from the manager (who should hold responsibility. After all, if they don’t, why do they have that job?) onto the laborer, knowing that the organization and the media will back it up. While you may think I’m making a generalization, the 2021-2023 anti-remote work push in the media was grotesque proof of where the media’s true allegiance lies — the media happily manufactured consent for return-to-office mandates from large companies by framing remote work as some sort of destructive force, doing all they can to disguise how modern management has no fucking idea how the workplace actually works. These articles were effectively fan fiction for managers and bosses demanding we return to the office — ridiculous statements about how remote work “failed young people” (it didn’t) or how employees needed remote work more than their employers because “the chitchat, lunches and happy hours” are so important. Had any of those reporters spoken to an actual worker, they’d say that they value more time with their families, rather than the grind of a daily commute softened with the promise of an occasional company pizza party — which usually happens outside of the typical working hours, anyway. These articles rarely (if ever) cared about whether remote work was more productive, or that the disconnect appeared to be between managers and workers. It was, from the very beginning, about crushing the life out of a movement that gave workers more flexibility and mobility while suppressing managers’ ability to hide how little work they did. I give credit to CNBC in 2023 for saying the quiet part out loud — that “...the biggest disadvantage of remote work that employers cite is how difficult it is to observe and monitor employees” — because when you can’t do that, you have to (eugh!) actually know what they’re doing and understand their work. Yet higher up the chain, the invulnerability continues. CEOs may get fired — and more are getting fired than ever, although sadly not the ones we want — but always receive some sort of golden parachute payoff at the end before walking into another role at another organization doing exactly the same level of nothing. Yet before that happens, A CEO is allowed to pull basically every lever before they take a single ounce of accountability — laying people off, pay freezes, moving from salaried to contracted workers, closing down sites, cutting certain products, or even spending more fucking money. If you or I misallocated billions of dollars on stupid ideas we’d be fired. CEOs, somehow, get paid more. Let me give you an example. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that the “ultimate computer…is the mixed reality world” and that Microsoft would be “inventing new computers and new computing” in 2016, pushing his senior executives to tell reporters that Hololens was Microsoft’s next wave of computing in 2017, selling hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of headsets to the military in 2019, then debuting HoloLens 2 at BUILD 2019 only for the on-stage demo to break in realtime, calling for a referendum on capitalism in 2020, then saying he couldn’t overstate the breakthrough of the metaverse in 2021. Let’s see what he said about it (props to Preston Gralla of ComputerWorld for finding this): As Gralla notes, Nadella said Microsoft would be, “…beefing up development in projects such as its Mixed Reality Tool Kit MRTK, the virtual reality workspace project AltspaceVR (which it had bought back in 2017), its HoloLens virtual reality headset, and its industrial metaverse unit, among others,” before firing all 100% members of its industrial Metaverse core team along with those behind MRTK and shutting down AltSpace VR (which it acquired in 2017) in 2023, before discontinuing HoloLens 2 entirely in 2024. Nadella was transparently copying Meta and Mark Zuckerberg’s ridiculous “metaverse” play, and absolutely nothing happened to him as a result. The media — outlets like The Verge and independents like Ben Thompson — happily boosted the metaverse idea when it was announced and conveniently forgot it the second that Microsoft and Meta wanted to talk about AI (no, really, both The Verge and Ben Thompson were ready and waiting) without a second’s consideration about what was previously said. A true Business Idiot never admits wrongdoing, and the more powerful the Business Idiot is, the more likely there are power structures that exist to avoid them having to do so. The media, captured by other Business Idiots, has become poisoned by power, deferring to its whims and ideals and treating CEOs with more respect, dignity and intelligence than anyone that works for them. When a big company decides they want to “do AI,” the natural reaction is to ask “how?” and write down the answer rather than think about whether it’s possible or whether the company might profit (say, by increasing their shareholder price) by having whatever they say printed ad verbatim. These people aren’t challenged by the media, or their employees, because their employees are vulnerable all the time, and often encouraged to buy into whatever bullshit is du jour like hostages being held by a terrorist group that eventually fall victim to Stockholm syndrome. They’re only challenged by shareholders, who are agnostic about idiocy because it’s not core to value in any meaningful sense, as we’ve seen with crypto, the metaverse and AI, and shareholders will tolerate infinite levels of idiocy if it boosts the value of their holdings. It goes further too. 2021 saw the largest amount of venture capital invested in the last decade, a record-breaking $643 billion, with a remarkable $329.5 billion of that invested in the US alone. Some of the biggest deals include Amazon reseller aggregator Thrasio, which raised $1 billion in October 2021 and filed for bankruptcy in February 2025, cloud security company Lacework, which raised $525 million in January 2021 then $1.3 billion in October 2021 and was rumoured to be up for sale to Wiz, only for the deal to collapse, and autonomous car company Cruise, which raised $2.75 billion 2021 and was killed off in December 2024. The people who lose their livelihoods — those who took stock in lieu of cash compensation, and those who end up getting laid off at the end — are always workers, while people like Lacework co-CEO Jay Parikh (who oversaw “reckless spending” and “management dysfunction” according to The Information) can walk into highly-paid positions at companies like Microsoft, as he did in October 2024 a few months after a fire sale to cybersecurity Fortinet for around $200 million according to analysts. It doesn’t matter if you’re wrong, or if you run your company badly, because the Business Idiot is infallible, and judged too by fellow disconnected Business Idiots. In a just society, nobody would want to touch any of the C-suite that oversaw a company that handed out Nintendo Switches to literally anyone who booked a meeting (as with Lacework). Instead, the stank remains on the employees alone. It’s so easy, and perhaps inevitable, to feel a sense of nihilism about it all. Nothing matters. It’s all symbolic. Our world is filled with companies run by people who don’t interact with the business, and that raise money from venture capitalists that neither run businesses nor really have any experience doing so. And despite the fact that these people exist several abstractions from reality, the things that they do and the decisions they make impact us all. And it’s hard to imagine how to fix it. We live in a system of iniquity, dominated by people that do not interact with the real world who have created an entire system run by their fellow Business Idiots. The Rot Economy’s growth-at-all-costs mania is a symptom of the grander problem of shareholder supremacy, and the single-minded economic focus on shareholder value inevitably ends at an economy run by and for Business Idiots. There is a line, and it ends here — with layoffs, the destruction of our planet and our economy and our society, and a rising tide of human misery that nobody really knows where it comes from, and so, we don’t know who to blame, and for what. If our economy actually worked as a true meritocracy — where we didn’t have companies run by people who don’t use their products or understand how they’re made, and who hire similarly-specious people — these people would collapse under the pressure of having to know their ass from their earhole. Yet none of this would be possible without the enabling layers, and those layers are teeming with both Business Idiots and those unfortunate enough to have learned from them. The tech media has enabled every single bubble, without exception, accepting every single narrative fed to them by VCs and startups, with even critical reporters still accepting the lunacy of a company like OpenAI just because everybody else does too. Let’s be honest, when you remove all the money, our current tech industry is a disgrace. Our economy is held up by NVIDIA, a company that makes most of its money selling GPUs to other companies primarily so that they can start losing the money selling software that might eventually make them money, just not today. NVIDIA is defined by massive peaks and valleys, as it jumps on trends and bandwagons at the right time, despite knowing that these bandwagons always come to an abrupt halt. The other companies feature Tesla, a meme stock car company with a deteriorating brand and a chief executive famous for his divorces from both reality and multiple women along with a flagrant racism that may cost the company its life. A company that we are watching die in real time, with a stagnant line-up and actual fucking competition from companies that are spending big on innovation. In Europe and elsewhere, BYD is eating Tesla’s lunch, offering better products for half the price — and far less stigma. And this is just the first big Chinese automotive brand to go global. Others — like Chery — are enjoying rapid growth outside of China, because these cars are actually quite good and affordable, even when you factor in the impact of things like tariffs. Hey, remember when Tesla fired all the people in its charging network — despite that being one of the most profitable and valuable parts of the business? And then hired them back because it turns out they were actually useful? This is a good example of managerial alienation — decisions made by non-workers who don’t understand their customers, their businesses, or the work their employees do. And let’s not forget about the Cybertruck, a monstrosity both in how it looks and how it’s sold, and that’s illegal in the majority of developed countries because it is a death-trap for drivers and pedestrians alike. Oh, and that nobody actually wants, with Tesla sitting on a quarter’s worth of inventory that it can’t sell. Elsewhere is Meta, a collapsing social network with 99% of its revenue based on advertising to an increasingly-aged population and a monopoly so flagrantly abusive in its contempt for its customers that it’s at times difficult to call Instagram or Facebook social networks. Mark Zuckerberg had to admit to the Senate Judiciary Committee that people don’t use Facebook as a social network anymore. The reason why is because the platform is so fucking rotten, run by a company alienated from its user base, its decrepit product actively hostile to anybody trying to use it. And, more fundamentally, what’s the point of posting on Facebook if your friends won’t see it, because Meta’s algorithm decided it wouldn’t drive engagement? Meta is a monument to disconnection, a company that runs in counter to its own mission to connect people, run by Mark Zuckerberg, a man who hasn’t had a good idea since he stole it from the Winklevoss Brothers. The solution to all that ails him? Adding generative AI to every part of Meta, which…uh…was meant to do something other than burn $72 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, right? It isn’t clear what was meant to happen, but the Wall Street Journal reports that Meta’s AI chatbots are, and I quote, “empowered to engage in ‘romantic role-play’ that can turn explicit” — even with children. In a civil society, Zuckerberg would be ousted immediately for creating a pedophilic chatbot, — instead, four days after the story ran, everyone cheered Meta’s better-than-expected quarterly earnings. In Redmond, Microsoft sits atop multiple monopolies, using tariffs as a means to juice flailing Xbox revenue as it invests billions of dollars in OpenAI so that OpenAI can spend billions of dollars on cloud compute, losing billions more in the process, requiring Microsoft to invest further money to keep them alive. All because Microsoft wanted generative AI in Bing. What a fucking waste! While also raising the costs of its office suite — which it’s only able to hold a monopoly on because it acted so underhandedly in the 1990s. Amazon lumbers listlessly through life, its giant labor-abuse machine shipping things overnight at whatever cost necessary to crush the life out of any other source of commerce, its cloud services and storage arm, unsure who to copy next. Is it Microsoft? Is it Google? Who knows! But one analyst believes it’s making $5 billion in revenue from AI in 2025 — and spending $105 billion in capital expenditures. There are slot machines with a better ROI than this shit. Again, it’s a company that’s totally exploitative of its customers, no longer acting as a platform that helps people find the shit they need, but to direct them to the products that pay the most for prime advertising real-estate, no matter whether they are good or safe. Let’s be clear: Amazon’s recklessness will kill someone, if it hasn’t already. Then there’s the worst of them — Google. Most famous for its namesake, a search engine that it has juiced as hard as possible, and will continue to juice before the inevitable antitrust sentencing that would rob it of its power, along with the severance of its advertising monopoly. But don’t worry, Google also has a generative AI thing, for some reason, and no, you don’t have a choice about using it, because it’s now stapled onto Google Search and Google Assistant. At no point do any of these companies seem to be focused on making our lives better, or selling us any kind of real future. They exist to maintain the status quo, where cloud computing allows them to retain their various fiefdoms. They’re alienated from people. They’re alienated from workers. They’re alienated from their customers. They’re alienated from the world. They’re deeply antisocial and misanthropic — as demonstrated by Zuck’s moronic AI social network comments. And AI is a symptom of a reckoning of this stupidity and hubris. They cut, and cut, and stagnated. Their hope is a product that will be adopted by billions of imaginary customers and companies, and will allow them to cut further without becoming just a PO Box and a domain name. We have to recognize that what we’re seeing now with generative AI isn’t a fluke or a bug, but a feature of a system that’s rapacious and short-term by its very nature, and doesn’t define value as we do, because “value” gets defined by a faceless shareholder as “growth.” And this system can only exist with the contribution of the business idiot. These are the vanguard — the foot soldiers — of this system, and a key reason why everything is so terrible all the time, and why nothing seems to be getting better. Breaking from that status-quo would require a level of bravery that they don’t have — and perhaps isn’t possible in the current economic system. These people are powerful, and have big platforms. They’re people like Derek Thompson, famed co-author of the “abundance” agenda, who celebrates the idea of a fictitious version of ChatGPT that can entirely plan and execute a 5-year-old’s birthday party, or his co-author Ezra Klein, who, while recording a podcast where his researchers likely listened, talked proudly about replacing their work with OpenAI’s broken Deep Research product, because anything that can be outsourced must be, and all research is “looking at stuff that is relevant.” And really, that’s the most grotesque part about Business Idiots. They see every part of our lives as a series of inputs and outputs They boast about how many books they’ve read rather than the content of said books, about how many hours they work (even though they never, ever work that many), about high level they are in a video game they clearly don’t play, about the money they’ve raised and the scale they’ve raised it at, and about how expensive and fancy their kitchen gadgets are. Everything is dominance, acquisition, growth and possession over any lived experience, because their world is one where the journey doesn’t matter, because their journeys are riddled with privilege and the persecution of others in the pursuit of success. These people don’t want to automate work, they want to automate existence. They fantasize about hitting a button and something happening, because experiencing — living! — is beneath them, or at least your lives and your wants and your joy are. They don’t want to plan their kids’ birthday parties. They don’t want to research things. They don’t value culture or art or beauty. They want to skip to the end, hit fast-forward on anything, because human struggle is for the poor or unworthy. When you are steeped in privilege and/or have earned everything through a mixture of stolen labor and office pantomime, the idea of “effort” is always negative. The process of creation — or affection, of love, of kindness, of using time not just for an action or output — is disgusting to the Business Idiot, because those are times they could be focused on themselves, or some nebulous self-serving “vision” that is, when stripped back to its fundamental truth, is either moronic or malevolent. They don’t realise that you hire a worker for the worker’s work rather than just the work themselves, which is why they don’t see why it’s so insulting to outsource their interactions with human beings. You’ll notice these people never bring up examples of automating actual work — the mind-numbing grunt work that we all face in the workplace — because they neither know nor care what that is. Their “problems” are the things that frustrate them, like dealing with other people, or existing outside of the gilded circles of socialite fucks or plutocrats, or just things that are an inevitable facet of working life, like reading an email. Your son’s birthday party or a conflict with a friend can, indeed, be stressful, but these are not problems to be automated out. They are the struggles that make us human, the things that make us grow, the things that make us who we are, which isn’t a problem for anybody other than somebody who doesn’t believe they need to change in any way. It's both powerful and powerless at the same time — a nihilistic way of seeing our lives as a collection of events we accept or dismiss like a system prompt, the desperate pursuit of such efficient living that you barely feel a thing until you die. I’ve spent years writing about these people without giving them a name, because categorizing anything is difficult. I can’t tell you how long it took for me to synthesize the Rot Economy from the broader trends I saw in tech and elsewhere, how long it took for me to thread that particular needle, to identify the various threads that unified events that are otherwise separate and distinct. I am but one person. Everything you’ve read in my newsletter to this point has been something I’ve had to learn. Building an argument and turning it into words — often at the same time — that other people will read doesn’t come naturally to anyone. It’s something you have to deliberately work at. It’s imperfect. There are typos. These newsletters increase in length and breadth and have so many links, and I will never, ever change my process, because part of said process is learning, relearning, processing, getting pissed off, writing, rewriting, and so on and so forth. This process makes what I do possible, and the idea of having someone automate it disgusts me, not because I’m special or important, but because my work is not the result of me reading a bunch of links or writing a bunch of words. This piece is not just 13,000 words long — it’s the result of the 800,000 or more words I wrote before it, the hundreds of stories I’ve read in the past, the hours of conversations with friends and editors, years of accumulating knowledge and, yes, growing with the work itself. This is not something that you create through a summation of content vomited by an AI, but the chaotic histories of a human being mashed against the challenge of trying to process it.

Full Content:
This Grow a Garden Beanstalks guide tells you if this prismatic plant is the next best Candy Blossom, including its buying price, stock rotation chances, profits, and more! Should you save your money, or splash some cash on this rare seed? Find out in this guide! Start playing Grow a Garden on Roblox. Find out how the Beanstalk fares against other seeds in our Tier List. Or, find out when to check for its stock in our Grow a Garden Stock Guide. The Beanstalk is the first Prismatic rarity seed sold by the merchant on the main island. This puts this plant on quite a pedestal to impress players and make them filthy rich, given it has a 0.0005% restock chance every 5 minutes, and costs an expensive 10,000,000$ to buy a single seed. This seed costs just as much as the event Candy Blossom, which many players (myself included) missed out on. So is the Beanstalk just as profitable? The Beanstalk grows tall and is multi-harvest, meaning you don’t lose the original plant when you collect it, unlike Bamboo, Mushrooms, etc. An unmutated, average-sized Beanstalk typically fetches for 15-30k cash. It also produces multiple growth points from one stem, and since it grows upwards, it tends not to take up too much garden space. This makes them an excellent crop to harvest and very profitable! To really get your money’s worth, I recommend not collecting any fully grown Beanstalks for a while until they’ve had the chance to develop mutations. In short, yes, the Beanstalk is likely just as profitable as the Candy Blossom, making this plant meta! The Grow a Garden Discord Server has a channel dedicated to stock rotations, so you won’t miss out next time the Beanstalk makes a shop appearance. Or, you could buy it for Robux, but where is the fun in that? Copyright 2025 Droid Gamers Inc. - All Rights Reserved. - Privacy Policy

The I/O conference in Mountain View, California, has adopted a tone of increased urgency since the rise of generative AI posed a fresh threat to Google's longtime stronghold of organizing and retrieving information on the internet. In recent months, Google has become more aggressive in asserting it has caught up to competitors after appearing flat-footed upon the release of Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT. Top executives including CEO Sundar Pichai have often cited the pole position of its Gemini class of AI models on public leaderboards, ahead of top models from competitors including OpenAI and Meta. Google and Xreal debut Aura AR Glasses to rival Meta’s Orion plan Pichai said at the conference: "Over and over, we've been able to deliver the best models at the most effective price point." The Gemini app now has more than 400 million monthly active users, Pichai said. The Alphabet chief also announced other advancements showcasing AI, including an update to the company's Google Meet video conferencing software that would translate meetings between English and Spanish in real time. And Pichai showcased Google Beam, hardware that makes video chats feel like they are taking place in person, in partnership with HP and based on Google's Project Starline. At the same time, with consumer use of AI chatbots maturing, investors will be tracking the degree to which Google is aggressive in disrupting its search advertising business line, which accounted for the majority of the company's $350 billion in 2024 revenue. Earlier this month, Alphabet stock lost $150 billion in market value in one day after an Apple executive testified during one of Google's antitrust cases that AI offerings had caused a decline in searches on Apple's Safari Web browser for the first time. In turn, some analysts reassessed how to measure Google's dominant search market share, which has for years hovered around 90% by traditional metrics. A Bernstein analyst note this month placed the figure at 65% to 70% when accounting for usage of AI chatbots. Wells Fargo analysts estimated that Google's market share could fall to less than 50% in five years. The analysts cited a behavioral shift drawing consumers toward AI chatbots where they once used traditional search engines. Google's market position could be further rocked by the outcome of legal challenges, in particular a pair of antitrust cases brought by the Justice Department, which is seeking the forced sale of parts of the tech giant including its Chrome browser. Investment in AI accounts for most of Alphabet's $75 billion in forecasted capital expenditures this year, a dramatic uptick from the $52.5 billion in 2024 spending that the company reported. In April, Pichai reiterated those spending plans despite market uncertainty around tariffs. Google has injected more AI into its core search engine over the past two years, primarily through AI Overviews, generative AI summaries that are increasingly appearing atop the traditional hyperlinks to relevant webpages, and AI Mode, an experimental version that leverages AI more intensively to answer complex queries. Tuesday's announcements will likely include further updates to search as well as Google's effort to deliver a "universal AI agent." At last year's conference, the company teased Project Astra, a prototype tool that can talk to users about anything captured on their smartphone camera in real time. The company began experimenting with inserting ads into AI Overviews last May, though it has avoided any radical changes that would rock the boat. Meanwhile, Google is expanding other revenue streams to monetize AI. Last week, the company told Reuters its Google One consumer subscription service had crossed 150 million subscribers helped by "millions" of customers who signed up for a $19.99 per month plan with access to AI capabilities unavailable for most free users.

Title: David’s Bridal Unveils an Upscale Concept

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily The new format, called Diamond & Pearls, officially launches May 29 in Delray Beach, Fla. Senior Editor, Retail David’s Bridal Inc., seeking to lift its image and widen its appeal to a higher-income audience, has launched a new retail format called Diamonds & Pearls. “It’s a boutique concept, with a curated and tech-enhanced experience blending affordable luxury and couture with a refined, elevated environment,” said Elina Vilk, president and chief business officer of David’s Bridal, in an interview. “Today’s brides are looking for more than a dress. They are looking for an immersive, shopping experience.” With the opening of the 3,500-square-foot Diamonds & Pearls at 9097 West Atlantic Avenue, Suite 104 in Delray Beach, Fla., “We saw an opportunity to reimagine the bridal journey through innovation, curation and style,” Vilk said. The official opening is May 29, though there’s already been a few “soft opening” days to get out any kinks. Related Articles Fashion Features Brides Like '90s-style Wedding Gowns, Brown Flowers and Lace-like Nails, Pinterest Says Designer and Luxury Giambattista Valli Won a Bridal Award in Barcelona Compared with the 193 David’s Bridal stores around the country, and their no-frills, moderate price presentations, Diamonds & Pearls takes a contemporary and personalized approach for the brides, bridesmaids and special occasion categories contained in a smaller space. It still has some of the same selections as David’s Bridal, with approximately one-third of the stock keeping units typically found in a traditional David’s Bridal store, but is curated to the most trending styles and silhouettes. There are also some exclusive designer offerings, from Viola Chan and Marchesa, as well as David Bridal’s signature lines such as Galina Signature, Oleg Cassini and Melissa Sweet, among other labels. Chan will work with clients on a custom design, either in person or through virtual calls. In addition, appointments can be arranged with personal stylists, Champagne is served, walk-ins are welcomed as well and trunk shows are planned. You May Also Like Inside the shop, interactive digital touchscreens powered by Shopify POS provide clients access to David Bridal’s full inventory of dresses, accessories and shoes. “Internally, we are calling it the store of the future,” Vilk said. The future may bring additional Diamonds & Pearls stores, as the company is close to signing another lease on the Northeast Coast. But before green-lighting an expansion of Diamonds & Pearls, Vilk and her team will analyze the performance of the first store for the next four or five months. “We are ‘test and learn’ people,” Vilk said. “We want to see how this store goes, but we anticipate this will be a big part of our strategy next year.” There’s been “so much demand” for the kind of bridal shopping experience Diamonds & Pearls provides. Prices start at $400 to $500, average just over $2,000, and go as high as $6,000 or $7,000 for a custom couture gown, Vilk said. “We are way more affordable than many bridal boutiques,” she said, suggesting other boutiques typically average out with a $4,000 to $5,000 price point. The launch of Diamonds & Pearls reflects David’s Bridal’s rebuilding efforts after going in and out of bankruptcy two times in the last seven years, in 2018 and 2023, leading to the sale of the company to asset manager Cion Investment. (“Diamonds and Pearls” is also the name of a 1991 Prince album.) “We’re actually doing pretty well,” Vilk said when asked how the business is currently performing. “We are completely changing the strategy and driving innovation with concepts like Diamonds & Pearls, becoming more asset-light and taking a tech-forward approach.” Vilk said David’s Bridal is rebuilding its wedding planning service, started a retail media company in January, and is looking at new AI tools. “Gen Z brides are tech-forward. They don’t start their journey in the store anymore. She’ll browse online first, then see it on social media,” said Vilk, a former Hootsuite, Meta, PayPal and Visa executive. “And she wants affordable luxury.” Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.

Title: Don't call it a comeback: Why Goldman sees the downtrodden Magnificent 7 roaring back to beat the market

The stock market's tech titans stumbled in the first quarter, but 2025 will still be another winning year for the Magnificent Seven, Goldman Sachs said. In a recent note, chief equity strategist David Kostin projected that the mega-cap tech cohort will once again outperform the rest of the S&P 500 in 2025, extending a streak of stellar gains to a third straight year. "We continue to expect that superior earnings growth will drive the Magnificent 7 to outperform the S&P 493 in 2025, but by a smaller magnitude than in recent years," Kostin wrote. "The share price outperformance of the Magnificent 7 has been tied to their earnings growth outperformance." It's a take that might seem contradictory to what's transpired so far this year, as trade policy, AI disruptions, and antitrust moves have muddled the outlook for Big Tech. The group, which includes Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Apple, is down 5% year-to-date, trailing the 4% gain achieved by the broader index. Some big banks, such as Morgan Stanley, have called on investors to reduce tech exposure. Ye, despite the slump so far, Kostin noted that mega-cap tech demonstrated earnings outperformance in the first quarter. In 2025, earnings-per-share growth has surged 28% for the Mag Seven, handily outpacing 9% for the S&P 493. "This magnitude of surprise was the largest since the 2Q 2021 reporting season when the Magnificent 7 beat earnings estimates by 27%," the bank wrote. "Partly as a result of strong 1Q results, consensus 2025 earnings estimates for the Magnificent 7 are roughly in line with where they began the year." What's more, the top tech stocks are now trading at a discounted valuation, resulting from narrowing earnings growth compared to previous years. "The relative valuation is the lowest it's been in the last two years," Kostin told Bloomberg TV. "From a starting point of entry, it's actually looking somewhat more attractive at these levels."

Business A Google logo is seen at a company research facility in Mountain View, California, U.S., May 13, 2025. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo MOUNTAIN VIEW, California :Alphabet's Google said on Tuesday it would put artificial intelligence into the hands of more Web surfers while teasing a $249.99-a-month subscription for its AI power users, its latest effort to fend off growing competition from startups like OpenAI. Google unveiled the plans amid a flurry of demos that included new smart glasses during its annual I/O conference in Mountain View, California, which has adopted a tone of increased urgency since the rise of generative AI challenged the tech company's longtime stronghold of organizing and retrieving information on the internet. In recent months, Google has become more aggressive in asserting it has caught up to competitors after appearing flat-footed upon the release of Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022. On Tuesday, it further laid out a vision for Google Search that lets consumers ask virtually anything, from simple queries to complex research questions, from analyzing what a smartphone camera sees to fetching an event ticket to buy. Google likewise said it aims to build AI that is personal and proactive, whether phoning a store for users or sending students a practice test generated on the fly.
