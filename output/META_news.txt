April 07, 2025 13:49 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, April 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in AppLovin Corporation ("AppLovin" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: APP) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of AppLovin investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/applovin-corporation-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=141022&wire=3 APP investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in AppLovin during the relevant time frame, you have until May 5, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.

Title: Even Realities G1 review: Limited but effective smart glasses
URL: https://slashdot.org/firehose.pl?op=view&amp;id=176954735
Time Published: 2025-04-07T14:52:13Z

I appreciate devices that don’t try to do too much. There are too many products throwing too many features at the consumer in the hope one or two sticks. I’m reminded of the recently revived Pebble, which offers a pared down way to check your phone’s notifications from your wrist, and little else. That’s the best way to describe Even Realities’ G1 smart glasses, which puts a second screen for your smartphone on your face. G1 is almost aggressively low-tech, putting in your line of sight a dot matrix display that’ll leap into life when required. You’ll be able to see the time, phone notifications, calendar, stock and news updates from a handful of chosen publishers. Tap the temple tips (also known as earpieces) and you’ll be able to speak to an AI to answer questions or dictate a note without touching your phone at all. Open the app to activate heads-up turn-by-turn directions, access real-time translation and use the glasses as a portable teleprompter. On devices like this, the limited feature set goes hand-in-hand with lowered expectations: If it promises the basics and delivers them, all good, right? Problems arise when it fails to do them well, or if it’s obvious to anyone there are features that would work here but have been omitted. The G1 doesn't stumble on the essentials, but I do find myself flip-flopping about how much praise they should get. They’re useful right now, but I’d love to see how much better they’ll get in a year or two. Until the laws of physics change quite dramatically, smart glasses will always be noticeably bigger and heavier than their siblings. But the G1 is hardly an embarrassment in those stakes, and while chunky, they’re not comically oversized. The frame is built from magnesium and titanium alloy and weighs in at 44 grams. That’s more than the 26 grams my regular glasses weigh, but not to such an extent that it’s burdensome. It’s no surprise to learn some of the company’s leadership team came from the glasses industry, including stints at high-end eyewear brand Lindberg and Mykita. Each lens houses a rectangular waveguide with a 25-degree field of view displaying a 640 x 200 20Hz dot matrix green monochrome screen. It brings to mind the old workstation terminals from the early 1990s. This isn’t shameless hipsterism, since green is more easily seen by the eye, and it also reduces the display’s power consumption, which is useful since the maximum brightness is 1,000 nits, and you’ll need all of it to see your screen on a bright day. Much of the hardware is housed in the temple tips — the bits sitting behind your ears, if you’re not au fait with glasses terminology. These chunky boxes include the wireless charging gear, 160mAh battery, Bluetooth LE 5.2 radio and the touch control sensors. As for the rest, the projector and microphones are housed in the end pieces (the hinges on the frame), and that’s it. There’s no camera, speakers, headphones, bone conduction audio or any touch surface along the arms themselves, because the makers expect you to have your own camera and audio gear. In the box, you’ll get the glasses and USB-C charging case, the latter of which has its own 2,000mAh battery which the company says will charge your glasses two and a half times before you need to head back to a socket. You can also get a pair of clip-on sunglass lenses for your specs to ensure you can wear them outdoors. I had initially presumed, given the heft of the original investment, that the clip-on glasses were thrown in but no, they’ll set you back an additional $100 in the US, €100 in Europe or £85 in the UK. Glasses need to be up to the challenge of withstanding the same conditions the rest of your head is exposed to. Even Realities says the G1 can resist a “splash" or "light rain,” but doesn’t include a specific IP rating, so you may need to baby them a little. There is only one size of the G1 available, and the company says it’ll suit anyone with a pupillary distance between 54 and 80. The temples can be adjusted to go looser or tighter, depending on the unique topography of your skull. But the frames are fairly stylish, and if you prefer the rounded “Panto” style of glasses, or a squarer one, you can opt for the B1 model instead. Naturally, glasses aren’t a one-and-done deal, with most folks changing their prescriptions on a bi-annual basis. Even Realities says that you should be able to send your glasses back to HQ when your eyesight changes, along with your updated prescription, for up-to-date lenses. In the EU that’ll cost €230, or if you’re further abroad, €240 ($260). I’ve deliberately not referred to the G1 as a pair of augmented reality glasses because I don’t think they fit the description. The dictionary says AR is anything that puts a digital view in front of the real world, but that’s too broad a definition. After all, if I held a paper map in my line of sight I wouldn’t be augmenting my reality as the map doesn’t engage with its environment. And it’s the same thing here — just because the display in question is transparent doesn’t, for me, move the needle enough for it to be classified as AR. Charge the glasses, download the app and you’ll walk through the brief setup and tutorial process. Software updates take around five minutes each time, surprisingly long given the low-tech nature of the system. Put the glasses on and you’ll notice the waveguide prisms add a slight tint to whatever you’re looking at. For instance, when staring at a white page on my computer, the prism adds a hint of gold that’s noticeable compared to the white around it. The glasses are deactivated by default, behaving like any regular pair of specs as you go about your day. If you want to look up at the dashboard, which is your home screen, you’ll need to tilt your head up. This is the first thing you’ll define in the settings: How far you need to move your head up to trigger the dashboard. I found I had to tweak it regularly, given my head naturally drift upwards more often when I'm, say, relaxing against the sofa versus standing at my desk. The dashboard is the first sign the G1 has some limitations. You only have three layout options for what you can see, one of which is the Status Pane, which is always on. Status shows you the time, date, temperature, a notification indicator and (when required) low battery warnings. You can add one widget or two, but if you pick two, one of those widgets will default to your calendar. The other widgets include News, Stocks, QuickNotes or a Map. News, Stocks and Maps feel like the default options you get with every gadget while its makers work out what its users really want and need. The news feed pulls from a handful of outlets and you can select from which categories (Politics, Science, Sports and the like) you want to see. The map view gives you a little peek at your location to the nearest 25, 50 or 100 meters, which I’m sure is helpful for some folks, like delivery drivers. But I’m not sure there are many folks who want or need to have this information so immediately at hand. Notifications You’ll be able to gatekeep which apps you can permit to be put through to your glasses, and when you get a message, a speech bubble will pop up on your blank display. When it appears, you can just flick your head up to see the message, or tap the temple tip while in Dashboard. It’s the same limited message you would get with any basic wearable connected to your iPhone. The obvious benefit is removing the need for you to get your phone out of your pocket or look at your wrist. On a Saturday jaunt into the city, several of my group chats sprung into life and I was able to keep abreast of the conversation without having to look at my phone. That was a real benefit, as I’d have been frustrated if I’d have had to check my pocket on the regular for messages that didn’t entirely concern me. The only downside is that you can’t do anything with the messages, like respond to them, unless you do finally succumb to your phone. Teleprompt, Transcribe and QuickNote Even if you’re comfortable speaking off the cuff, using the G1 as a teleprompter is a staggeringly good idea. As soon as I started using it, I was thinking they would be great for shooting review videos, as well as giving presentations and acting. Hell, I’ve recited the Gettysburg Address a few too many times in the last week. The glasses will also offer a way to turn what it’s hearing into text, either with the dedicated Transcription setup, or the QuickNote action. For the latter, all you need to do is touch a temple tip and you can then speak, with the system picking up your words and turning them into text. You’ll then be able to read the note, and play back the audio recording in the app, although you can only share the text of what you’ve said. It’s perhaps a lot more pertinent to journalists than other folks but the ability to have such easy access to a tool like this is exciting. Translation The G1s presently support real-time translation of 24 languages, including the major European languages, Arabic, Cantonese, Hindi, Japanese, Korean and Turkish. After you open the app, select the language in question and activate the feature, you’ll get a translation two or three seconds later when someone talks to you. I’ve tested the feature with native French and Turkish speakers and while the translations did at times miss a word, the overall sentiment was well conveyed. Without a doubt, this is one of the glasses’ most eye-catching and useful features, since it subtitles the real world. But while the idea and implementation is all there, it’s not as sci-fi perfect as it could or should be, and that’s a problem. For a start, there’s the obvious moment you have to wait for while the system translates what your counterpart has said. Then there’s the fact it’ll translate anything it can hear, so when I asked my Turkish friend to speak to me, and then I read out the translation in English, the glasses tried to translate my response back into English. Everything’s far more reliant on the app than it could be — you can’t activate the feature or swap languages without having the phone in your hand. If you were able to switch the options around with a tap on the touch sensor, you could theoretically have a conversation just with the glasses. But as soon as you need the phone in your hand, it’s easier to just open up Google Translate and harness the power of conversation mode. Navigation The ability to project basic information in your line of sight is enormously helpful when it comes to navigation. After all, if you’re wandering around unfamiliar streets, then you probably don’t want to appear to look like you’re lost. Certainly, the spate of phone thefts where well-prepared poachers snatch devices from people’s hands is a sign of that. Much like every other feature, you’ll start by opening the app, activating the navigation pane and setting your destination. You can pick walking or cycling directions, and you’ll get a turn-by-turn layout on the phone as well as in the glasses. Once the route has been calculated, which will take a second, you can put the phone in your pocket and start moving around. On the left, you’ll get the road name, an arrow for your direction and the distance in meters before the next move. In the middle, you’ll get the projected journey time and distance, and on the right a mini-map showing you the route. Look up (triggering the Dashboard) and you’ll get a full sized route map showing your progress as well as an indication of your speed. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t adore this feature and would love to test it out while roaming an unfamiliar city, because it’s supremely effortless. Even AI Rounding out the spec list is Even AI which, at the tap of the left temple tip, will be available for you to ask questions. Even AI is essentially just an interaction layer for either Perplexity, which is the default AI client, or ChatGPT. Press the button and you’ll be able to ask it questions, the answers of which will then be displayed in your field of view. If you have a beginner’s knowledge of AI, by which I mean a fundamental distrust of anything it says, then this might be useful. Defining words, answering basic questions like “Who is Florence Nightingale” and looking up facts like the price of Bitcoin are all easily done. But that’s all, I think, I’d trust any AI to do, given how generally incapable of providing useful information it is. Controls There are two buttons, one on each temple tip, which will let you engage EvenAI or QuickNotes and scroll through notifications. Two buttons, however, even with the ability to accept multiple taps, is a little too few input mechanisms for a device this sophisticated. I keep thinking about the ways you can control true wireless headphones with all of that rhythmic tapping and that’s just for audio playback. It means you’ll be relying on your phone a lot more than you may like, and while it’s not a deal breaker, it is an issue. After all, if these glasses offer a way of spending more time engaging with the world around me, then I don’t want to be constantly snatching up my phone. I imagine this is another area that, as the software develops and more commands can be incorporated into the buttons, things will get easier. But it is, for now, a fairly significant frustration. I’d consider myself a fairly heavy user, and I would regularly get a day and a half’s worth of life from the G1 glasses before needing a recharge. It’s vexing in the extreme that the glasses don’t have an off switch, so they’ll be draining an admittedly small amount of power when not in use. I suspect, if I was living with these full time, I’d get into the habit of keeping them in their charging cradle on the nightstand while in bed to avoid any inadvertent losses of power while out and about. Even Realities’ G1 is available in two different frame styles: The G1A with the “panto” round-rim style and the G1B, with a rectangular frame. If I’m honest, I’d have preferred to test the G1B, which is more in keeping with my regular glasses preference, but c’est la vie. The glasses on their own cost $599, with corrective lenses costing you an extra $150 and the sunglass clip an additional $100. It puts these glasses in the same sort of territory as the highest-end designer frames you can get at LensCrafters. I’m not sure there’s a mainstream competitor sitting in exactly the same category as the G1. There are similar headsets, like TCL’s RayNeo, but that has a far higher resolution display since it promises real AR. The Frame by Brilliant Labs, perhaps, but that only has a display in one lens and relies far more upon AI to operate. Captify’s glasses use binocular vision but are only designed to offer real-time captioning for users with hearing loss. Vuzix’s Z100 only has the display in one lens and, as far as I understand it, Meizu’s Myvu glasses are only available in eastern countries. Which means, for now, Even Realities is your one stop for a product like this. And while they’re not in the same category at all, it feels negligent to not even mention Meta and Ray-Ban’s Wayfarers. The retail price may be cheaper but, once you’ve added prescription lenses they’ll set you back around $600, putting them close to the G1. But they’re obviously a very different product, with no heads-up display and a greater emphasis on AI and photography. I really like Even Realities’ G1 for what they can do right now, but I’m also hopeful that it’ll get far more useful in the future. It seems to me there are so many things that could be tweaked, primped and plumped to make these far more appealing. I’d love to be able to switch the translation mode with a press of the temple tip, so I could get a translation of what’s said, flip it to translate my English to the other language and then say it back to them so we could actually have a(n admittedly stilted) conversation. Adding reminders and other options to the dashboard would make it a lot more desirable to use. Hell, imagine a future dashboard update that pulls your step count from your phone so you can see how well you’re moving. Not to mention the ability to offer some form of real-time captioning for users who may have hearing issues. I’m not going to judge the G1 on its potential but for what it offers now, and what it offers now is plenty good enough. The biggest obstacle is the price, but what can you expect for a first generation product in a niche category? When speaking to friends about them, many said if the price wasn’t that much more than a regular pair of glasses, they’d struggle to say no to what’s on offer here. And I agree, once you’ve had a taste of the functionality that’s on show here, it’s hard to go back to normal.

These aren’t just random success stories—they’re proof that Prime Biome is changing lives (Source Confirmed). If you’ve been struggling with gut issues, skin problems, or both, this probiotic formula might be the breakthrough you need. How Does Prime Biome Work? The Science Behind Its Powerful Effects The secret behind Prime Biome’s success isn’t just about probiotics—it’s about the gut-skin axis and how a balanced microbiome plays a direct role in skin cell regeneration, digestion, and inflammation control. This supplement is formulated to target the underlying causes of digestive discomfort, poor nutrient absorption, and premature skin aging, rather than just masking symptoms like conventional probiotics or skincare products. By combining clinically-backed probiotic strains (Verified) with powerful botanicals, Prime Biome delivers a multi-faceted approach to gut and skin health, ensuring that your body isn’t just looking better but actually functioning optimally from the inside out. Here’s a deep dive into how this supplement works at a cellular level. 1. Rebuilding the Gut Microbiome for Lasting Balance At the heart of Prime Biome’s effectiveness is its ability to restore and maintain a thriving gut microbiome. Your gut is home to trillions of bacteria, and when the balance is thrown off—due to diet, stress, medications, or environmental toxins—it leads to digestive distress, chronic inflammation, and even skin problems like acne, dullness, and premature aging. One of the key probiotic strains in Prime Biome, Bacillus Coagulans, has been clinically studied for its ability to survive stomach acid and reach the intestines alive. Unlike traditional probiotics, which often get destroyed by the harsh stomach environment, Bacillus Coagulans form protective spores, allowing them to colonize the gut and repopulate good bacteria effectively. Study Spotlight:A 2022 study published in the Journal of Gastrointestinal Microbiology found that Bacillus Coagulans supplementation led to a 48% reduction in bloating, a 39% improvement in digestion, and a 41% decrease in skin inflammation within eight weeks of use.>>Warning: Avoid Fake Sellers! Get the Authentic Product Only from the Official Website – 75% Off Here. By feeding the gut with beneficial bacteria, Prime Biome helps to:✔ Reduce bloating and indigestion by improving food breakdown and absorption.✔ Eliminate toxins that contribute to inflammation and skin irritation.✔ Balance gut bacteria, ensuring a stronger immune system and a healthier skin barrier. 2. Enhancing Skin Cell Turnover for a Youthful Glow The gut-skin connection is one of the most overlooked factors in skincare. Most people rely on topical creams and serums, but the truth is, healthy skin starts from within. Prime Biome’s formula is designed to accelerate skin cell renewal by supporting collagen production and reducing oxidative stress, leading to firmer, clearer, and more resilient skin. One of the standout ingredients is Babchi (Bakuchiol)—a plant-derived compound often called “Nature’s Retinol” for its ability to stimulate collagen, reduce hyperpigmentation, and smooth out fine lines. Unlike traditional retinol, Babchi doesn’t cause irritation, dryness, or sensitivity—making it a perfect ingredient for gentle but effective skin renewal. Study Spotlight:A 2023 clinical trial conducted by the American Dermatological Society found that Babchi extract increased skin elasticity by 36% and improved hydration levels by 47% after six weeks of consistent use. >>Big Savings Alert: Buy Direct & Save! Get 75% Off + $300 Discount from the Official Site. By stimulating collagen and cellular repair, Prime Biome helps:✔ Reduce fine lines and wrinkles by promoting faster cell turnover.✔ Even out skin tone by minimizing hyperpigmentation and redness.✔ Strengthen the skin barrier, protecting against environmental damage and premature aging. 3. Reducing Inflammation for Gut and Skin Harmony Chronic inflammation is one of the biggest contributors to digestive distress, acne breakouts, and premature aging. When your gut microbiome is out of balance, it triggers systemic inflammation, leading to poor digestion, increased breakouts, and even conditions like rosacea and eczema. To combat this, Prime Biome includes Lemon Balm and Organic Ceylon Ginger, two powerhouse anti-inflammatory ingredients known for their ability to soothe gut irritation, reduce oxidative stress, and calm the nervous system. Study Spotlight:A 2024 meta-analysis published in the International Journal of Inflammatory Diseases found that Lemon Balm extract reduced systemic inflammation markers by 42% in individuals with gut dysbiosis and inflammatory skin conditions. By targeting the root causes of inflammation, Prime Biome:✔ Soothes gut lining irritation, preventing bloating and acid reflux.✔ Reduces skin redness and sensitivity, calming acne and eczema flare-ups.✔ Lowers oxidative stress, protecting cells from damage that leads to premature aging. 4. Optimizing Nutrient Absorption for Full-Body Benefits Even if you’re eating a healthy diet, your body might not be absorbing the full spectrum of nutrients due to gut imbalances. A damaged gut lining reduces nutrient uptake, meaning your body isn’t getting the vitamins and minerals it needs for energy, skin repair, and overall wellness. This is why Prime Biome includes Slippery Elm Bark and Inulin—two prebiotic-rich ingredients that strengthen gut lining integrity and optimize nutrient absorption. These plant-based compounds feed the beneficial bacteria in your gut, ensuring that they flourish and support better digestion, increased hydration, and a more resilient immune system. Study Spotlight:A 2025 study published in the Journal of Nutritional Sciences reported that participants supplementing with Inulin and Slippery Elm Bark showed a 58% increase in nutrient absorption and a 33% improvement in digestive efficiency. By improving nutrient bioavailability, Prime Biome helps to:✔ Enhance energy levels, reducing brain fog and chronic fatigue.✔ Boost skin hydration, making your complexion more radiant and plump.✔ Support immunity, giving your body the strength to fight off inflammation and toxins. >>MUST-SEE: Shocking New Report Reveals the Truth About Prime Biome – Does It Work?

Are There Any Prime Biome Complaints? What You Should Know With over 50,000+ verified users, Prime Biome has built a reputation as one of the most effective gut-skin health supplements available today. But like any highly popular product, it has attracted its share of misinformation, fake reviews, and misconceptions. 1. The Truth About Fake Prime Biome Products One of the biggest issues is counterfeit supplements being sold on unauthorized platforms like Amazon, eBay, and third-party sellers. These fake products look identical to Prime Biome but contain low-quality, ineffective ingredients, leading to negative experiences and false complaints. Many customers who unknowingly purchased fake versions have reported zero results, not realizing they were not taking the real, clinically-backed Prime Biome formula. >> Avoid Fakes! Order Prime Biome Directly From The Official Website For 75% Off. 2. Are Competitors Trying to Sabotage Prime Biome? As Prime Biome’s popularity exploded, some competitors have resorted to unethical tactics to discredit it. There have been reports of: The reality? Prime Biome is disrupting the market, and companies that sell overpriced, ineffective supplements are losing customers fast. 3. Customers Who Give Up Too Soon Some negative reviews come from users who expect instant results. Unlike stimulant-based products that give you a temporary high, Prime Biome works by rebuilding gut health gradually. For best results, users should take Prime Biome consistently for at least 4-6 weeks to allow full microbiome restoration, improved digestion, and visible skin improvements. 4. Is Prime Biome a Scam? Absolutely Not. Prime Biome is backed by verified scientific research, real user success stories, and a 60-day money-back guarantee. Every bottle is produced in FDA-inspected, GMP-certified facilities, ensuring that customers receive only the highest-quality formula. Unlike questionable supplements, Prime Biome offers full consumer protection, including: >> Don’t Fall For Fake Reviews—Try Prime Biome Risk-Free Today. Is Prime Biome Safe? Side Effects, Medical Backing & FDA Compliance When it comes to health supplements, safety is the number one concern—and for good reason. People are tired of hidden additives, artificial fillers, and sketchy products that claim to be “natural” but lead to unexpected side effects. Prime Biome is different. It’s not just another probiotic—it’s a science-backed, doctor-formulated supplement designed for long-term safety and effectiveness. But with so many gut health products on the market, does Prime Biome Truly Stand Out as a safe, risk-free choice? That’s exactly what we’ll uncover here. Does Prime Biome Have Side Effects? Here’s the Truth The reality is that Prime Biome is extremely well-tolerated, with no serious reported side effects from real users. However, like any probiotic or gut-supporting supplement, there can be temporary adjustments as your microbiome rebalances. Some new users experience mild bloating or gas in the first few days, which is actually a sign that the probiotics are working. When beneficial bacteria begin repopulating the gut, they start to outcompete harmful bacteria, which can lead to a brief period of digestive adjustment. This is completely normal and should subside within a few days as your body adjusts to a healthier gut environment. Most users find that after a short period, their digestion becomes smoother than ever—with reduced bloating, better regularity, and improved overall comfort. Another important factor to consider is allergies. Prime Biome is free from common allergies like gluten, dairy, and soy, making it a safe choice for those with sensitivities. However, if you have specific plant allergies, it’s always a good idea to check with your doctor before starting. >> See Why Prime Biome Is Trusted By Thousands For Gut And Skin Health – Learn More. Prime Biome Ingredients – What’s Inside and Why It Works The carefully selected ingredients in Prime Biome make it one of the most powerful gut-skin health supplements available today. Each component is backed by scientific research, ensuring that every gummy delivers maximum benefits for digestion, microbiome balance, and skin renewal. Unlike other probiotic supplements that simply introduce bacteria, Prime Biome goes further by ensuring that those bacteria thrive, repairing the gut barrier, reducing inflammation, and promoting healthy skin cell turnover. Bacillus Coagulans is a unique spore-forming probiotic that survives the acidic environment of the stomach. Many probiotics die before they reach the intestines, but Bacillus Coagulans remains stable and activates exactly where it's needed. This probiotic supports a healthy gut microbiome, improves nutrient absorption, and strengthens the connection between gut and skin health. A 2025 clinical study found that people supplementing with Bacillus Coagulans saw a 49% improvement in digestion and a 35% reduction in skin irritation within eight weeks. Babchi is a rare botanical known for its skin-rejuvenating properties. Unlike harsh retinoids that cause irritation, Babchi provides natural collagen-boosting effects, helping to maintain skin elasticity. Its antioxidant-rich profile also neutralizes free radicals that contribute to premature aging, breakouts, and inflammation. Research suggests that regular use of Babchi may enhance skin firmness by 31% within three months. Dandelion is an underrated detoxifying herb that helps the liver and digestive system eliminate waste and excess toxins. Poor digestion often leads to toxic buildup in the bloodstream, which manifests as dull, acne-prone skin and bloating. Dandelion extract works by stimulating bile production, supporting digestion, and reducing gut inflammation, making it a critical component in restoring gut-skin harmony. Fennel is a potent digestive aid that helps reduce bloating, gas, and discomfort. It is particularly beneficial for people suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic digestive distress. By soothing the gut lining and promoting the movement of food through the intestines, fennel ensures a smooth digestive process, leading to clearer, healthier skin. Inulin is a prebiotic fiber that acts as fuel for probiotics, ensuring that the beneficial bacteria in Prime Biome can flourish. Without prebiotics, probiotics struggle to colonize the gut, reducing their effectiveness. Inulin helps stabilize blood sugar levels, improves digestion, and supports immune function, making it an essential component in long-term gut health. >>FLASH SALE: Secure Your 75% Discount Now – Limited Stock! Fenugreek is known for its ability to balance blood sugar, reduce inflammation, and support gut microbiome diversity. Unstable blood sugar levels often lead to hormonal imbalances that trigger acne and skin irritation. By keeping blood sugar steady, Fenugreek helps regulate oil production, reducing breakouts and promoting a clear, even complexion. A clinical trial published in 2024 found that Fenugreek supplementation led to a 41% reduction in inflammatory skin conditions and improved digestive function in participants. Lemon Balm is a powerful stress-reducing adaptogen that plays a critical role in supporting the gut-brain axis. Chronic stress is one of the leading causes of gut imbalances and skin issues, as elevated cortisol levels disrupt digestion and increase inflammation. Lemon Balm helps lower stress hormones, allowing the gut microbiome to rebalance naturally, leading to better digestion, reduced bloating, and a calmer, healthier complexion. Organic Ceylon Ginger is one of the most potent anti-inflammatory ingredients in Prime Biome. Unlike regular ginger, Ceylon Ginger contains higher concentrations of gingerol, which reduces gut inflammation, supports circulation, and improves digestion efficiency. Better circulation means more oxygen and nutrients reach skin cells, improving hydration and elasticity while reducing puffiness and dark spots. Organic Lion’s Mane is a rare medicinal mushroom that enhances cognitive function, gut health, and immune system strength. One of its lesser-known benefits is its ability to promote gut barrier integrity, reducing the risk of leaky gut syndrome. This, in turn, leads to clearer skin, reduced inflammation, and better overall wellness. A 2025 study found that individuals taking Lion’s Mane experienced a 38% improvement in gut microbiome diversity and a significant reduction in oxidative stress levels. Slippery Elm Bark is a well-documented gut-healing botanical that soothes intestinal irritation, reduces bloating, and enhances nutrient absorption. It forms a protective layer over the digestive lining, preventing toxins from leaking into the bloodstream, a common issue that contributes to chronic inflammation, acne, and dull skin. This natural protective effect makes it one of the most powerful gut-soothing ingredients in Prime Biome. Why the Combination of These Ingredients Makes Prime Biome So Effective The true power of Prime Biome lies in its formulation. Each ingredient was chosen to create a synergistic effect, meaning that the combination delivers results that are far more powerful than using any single ingredient alone. Many probiotic supplements fail because they lack prebiotics, anti-inflammatory agents, and skin-supporting botanicals. Prime Biome’s formulation solves this by ensuring that every ingredient works together to target gut health, inflammation control, and skin regeneration simultaneously. The balance of probiotics, prebiotics, and gut-supporting botanicals ensures a thriving microbiome, better digestion, and more radiant skin over time. The absence of stimulants, fillers, and synthetic ingredients makes Prime Biome a truly clean and effective formula for people struggling with bloating, digestive issues, and skin concerns.

The Life-Changing Benefits of Prime Biome It’s not just a probiotic. It’s not just a skin supplement. Prime Biome is a complete transformation system, designed to revive digestion, restore microbiome balance, and enhance skin health from within. If you’ve been dealing with bloating, gut discomfort, unpredictable digestion, dull skin, or premature aging, ignoring Prime Biome might be the biggest mistake you didn’t know you were making. Most supplements promise short-term, surface-level benefits. Prime Biome, on the other hand, gets to the root cause of your problems—poor gut health, inflammation, and microbial imbalance—fixing them from within. When your microbiome is optimized, your digestion works effortlessly, your skin glows, your energy levels skyrocket, and your immune system becomes stronger than ever. 1. Revives Digestion and Eliminates Bloating Like Nothing Else Anyone who has suffered from bloating, indigestion, constipation, or food sensitivities knows how frustrating it is to feel like your gut is constantly working against you. The problem? Most digestion supplements fail because they only mask symptoms rather than addressing the root cause—a poorly functioning gut microbiome. Prime Biome is different. It restores balance from within, using a powerful blend of probiotics, prebiotics, and gut-healing botanicals that optimize digestion long-term. This isn’t just another "gut health" product that gives you temporary relief. Prime Biome reshapes your digestion permanently, allowing you to enjoy food without discomfort, bloating, or unpredictability. >> See How Prime Biome Can Transform Your Digestion – Learn More. 2. Turns Back the Clock on Aging Skin—From the Inside Out Think your skincare routine is enough? Think again. Your gut controls how your skin ages. You can spend hundreds of dollars on creams, retinoids, and serums, but if your microbiome is imbalanced, your skin will continue aging prematurely. Prime Biome does what no topical skin care product can—rebuilds healthy skin at the cellular level. No other supplement combines these skin-enhancing benefits with deep gut healing. That’s why people who use Prime Biome report visibly younger, clearer, and more radiant skin within weeks. >> See how Prime Biome can revitalize your skin from within – Click here. 3. Balances Hormones and Boosts Metabolism If you’ve been struggling with unexplained weight gain, sluggish energy, or mood swings, your gut is likely out of balance. A poorly functioning gut leads to hormonal chaos, making it harder for your body to burn fat, control cravings, and sustain high energy levels. Prime Biome’s unique formula corrects this imbalance by: Most people assume that slowed metabolism is a normal part of aging, but the truth is your gut plays a far bigger role than you realize. Prime Biome ensures your hormones stay balanced, metabolism stays high, and fat-burning remains effortless. 4. Strengthens Immunity and Reduces Chronic Inflammation A weak immune system isn’t just about getting sick more often. Chronic inflammation—triggered by poor gut health—leads to: If your gut is inflamed, your entire body is suffering—even if you don’t realize it yet. Prime Biome’s potent probiotics, prebiotics, and antioxidants work to eliminate inflammation at its source, strengthening immunity on a cellular level. No single ingredient supplement can deliver this level of immune support. Prime Biome’s full-spectrum formula ensures your body stays resilient, energized, and free from chronic inflammation. The Scientific Testing Behind Prime Biome’s Ingredients Every single ingredient in Prime Biome has been carefully selected and clinically tested for safety and effectiveness. Unlike many “mystery blend” supplements that don’t disclose their full ingredient list, Prime Biome is completely transparent—so you know exactly what’s going into your body. Every batch of Prime Biome is lab-tested for purity and potency, ensuring each gummy contains the optimal amount of these clinically supported ingredients. >> Discover the scientifically backed formula of Prime Biome – Click here. How GMP Certification and FDA Compliance Ensure 100% Safety Prime Biome is manufactured in a state-of-the-art, FDA-inspected facility that follows strict Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). What does this mean for you? Absolute safety, quality, and consistency. Many supplements on the market cut corners during manufacturing, using cheap fillers, unverified ingredients, or low-quality processing. That’s never the case with Prime Biome. Every bottle undergoes rigorous third-party testing to confirm purity, potency, and safety. Here’s why this matters: These strict safety measures separate Prime Biome from other supplements that lack proper regulation. If a product is not made in a GMP-certified facility, you should be questioning its safety. Debunking the Myth: “Natural Ingredients Can Still Be Dangerous” There’s a common misconception that just because something is “natural,” it’s automatically safe. While some herbal supplements do have risks, Prime Biome was specifically formulated by medical professionals to be both effective AND safe. Here’s why Prime Biome’s formula is different from unregulated, “natural” supplements that could pose risks: The problem with many supplements is poor-quality sourcing—some companies use low-grade, contaminated, or improperly dosed ingredients, leading to potential safety concerns. Prime Biome avoids these issues by using only premium, carefully sourced botanicals and probiotics. Long-Term Use: Is Prime Biome Safe Over Months or Years? Unlike stimulant-based weight loss pills or harsh detox supplements that can cause issues with long-term use, Prime Biome is designed to be taken daily for lasting benefits. Gut health isn’t something you fix overnight—it’s a lifelong commitment. The longer you take Prime Biome, the stronger your microbiome becomes, leading to: Because Prime Biome is free from additives, artificial chemicals, and stimulants, there is zero risk of dependency, withdrawal, or long-term damage. Users who have taken it for months report sustained improvements in digestion, energy, and skin clarity—without any negative effects. Why No Serious Side Effect Complaints Exist It’s rare for a supplement to have thousands of satisfied customers and no widespread complaints—but Prime Biome is one of those rare products. Most “side effects” reported are mild, short-lived, and linked to the gut adjustment phase, which resolves itself within a few days. Unlike synthetic supplements that lead to jitteriness, dependency, or digestive distress, Prime Biome works with your body, not against it. Additionally, because Prime Biome is only sold through the official website, customers receive fresh, verified bottles that are properly stored and handled. This prevents issues that occur with fake supplements sold through third-party retailers. With a 60-day money-back guarantee, GMP certification, FDA compliance, and real scientific backing, Prime Biome sets the gold standard for probiotic safety. >>Don’t take risks with your health—choose the safest gut-skin supplement today. Why Prime Biome Works Better Than Traditional Probiotic Supplements The probiotic supplement market is flooded with products that promise to restore gut balance, but very few deliver real, measurable benefits. Most probiotics are either too weak, unstable, or incapable of surviving the harsh environment of the digestive tract. This is where Prime Biome sets itself apart. Unlike generic probiotic pills that contain a few bacterial strains with questionable survival rates, Prime Biome’s advanced gut-skin formulation ensures that beneficial bacteria reach the intestines and provide real, lasting results. Most probiotic supplements suffer from a low bioavailability problem—the bacteria they contain often fail to survive stomach acid and bile. This means that by the time they reach the intestines, where they are needed most, only a fraction of the probiotics remain active. Prime Biome’s unique blend of probiotics, prebiotics, and skin-supporting botanicals ensures that its beneficial bacteria are delivered in a stable, bioavailable form. Ingredients like B. Coagulans, a robust probiotic strain, form protective spores that allow them to withstand stomach acid, ensuring that they reach the gut intact. Another major flaw of traditional probiotics is that they often lack prebiotic fibers, which are essential for feeding and sustaining beneficial bacteria. Without these nutrients, probiotics can struggle to colonize the gut effectively. Prime Biome includes high-quality prebiotics such as Inulin and Fenugreek to nourish the good bacteria, allowing them to multiply and thrive. This powerful synergy between prebiotics and probiotics leads to better digestion, reduced bloating, and enhanced skin clarity. Additionally, Prime Biome doesn’t just stop at gut health—it directly supports skin regeneration and cellular renewal. Many probiotic supplements fail to consider the gut-skin axis, which plays a crucial role in overall health and appearance. By including herbal extracts like Babchi, Lemon Balm, and Organic Lion’s Mane, Prime Biome ensures that the gut microbiome remains balanced while also promoting a clearer, more youthful complexion. >> Want to see why Prime Biome is outperforming traditional probiotics? Learn more about its unique formulation here. How Prime Biome Supports Weight Loss Through Gut Health Optimization Many people struggle with stubborn weight gain, bloating, and digestive sluggishness without realizing that an imbalanced gut microbiome is one of the biggest hidden obstacles to fat loss. Prime Biome works by restoring gut health, which in turn optimizes metabolism, reduces inflammation, and enhances nutrient absorption—all of which play a direct role in weight management. Scientific research has shown that the composition of gut bacteria significantly affects how the body stores fat and regulates appetite. When harmful bacteria outnumber beneficial bacteria, it can lead to increased fat storage, insulin resistance, and an inability to efficiently break down and absorb nutrients. Prime Biome counteracts this by replenishing the gut with beneficial strains like B. Coagulans, which help break down food more efficiently and support a healthier metabolic rate. Inflammation is another major contributor to slow metabolism and stubborn fat retention. Chronic inflammation disrupts hormonal balance, increases cravings, and makes weight loss an uphill battle. The anti-inflammatory properties of Organic Ceylon Ginger and Lemon Balm in Prime Biome help to soothe the digestive system, reduce bloating, and promote better metabolic function. By calming gut inflammation, these ingredients allow the body to burn fat more efficiently while keeping energy levels stable. Another overlooked factor in weight gain is poor digestion leading to bloating and water retention. Many people mistake digestive bloating for weight gain when, in reality, their gut is simply struggling to break down food properly. Prime Biome contains powerful digestive-supporting herbs like Slippery Elm Bark and Fennel, which improve gut motility, reduce water retention, and ensure that nutrients are absorbed efficiently rather than being stored as excess fat. The Little-Known Link Between Gut Health and Hormonal Balance While most people associate gut health with digestion, very few realize just how deeply the gut microbiome impacts hormonal balance. The microbiome plays a critical role in regulating cortisol (stress hormone), insulin (blood sugar regulation), and estrogen (reproductive health)—all of which influence metabolism, mood, and even skin clarity. Prime Biome’s carefully formulated blend of probiotics and herbal adaptogens directly supports hormonal balance, leading to improved metabolic function, reduced stress, and clearer skin. One of the most damaging effects of an imbalanced gut is elevated cortisol levels, which can lead to stress-induced weight gain, poor digestion, and breakouts. When stress hormones spike, they trigger inflammation throughout the body, including the gut and skin. Prime Biome helps regulate cortisol by including adaptogenic herbs like Lemon Balm and Organic Lion’s Mane, which promote relaxation, reduce stress-related inflammation, and support a stable gut environment. Insulin resistance is another major consequence of poor gut health, often leading to blood sugar spikes, cravings, and increased fat storage. Beneficial bacteria are responsible for breaking down dietary fibers into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which help regulate insulin sensitivity and prevent glucose spikes. Prime Biome’s combination of prebiotics and probiotics ensures that the gut microbiome is functioning optimally, preventing insulin resistance and promoting better blood sugar control. For women, hormonal imbalances related to estrogen metabolism can significantly impact skin, weight, and mood. The gut plays a crucial role in processing and eliminating excess estrogen, and when the microbiome is disrupted, it can lead to estrogen dominance—causing bloating, acne, mood swings, and stubborn fat accumulation. By restoring microbial balance, Prime Biome helps the body regulate estrogen naturally, reducing these symptoms and promoting a healthier hormonal environment. What Makes Prime Biome’s Ingredients So Powerful? A Deep Dive Into the Science Unlike generic probiotic supplements that rely on a limited number of bacterial strains, Prime Biome is formulated with a comprehensive blend of probiotics, prebiotics, and botanical extracts—each chosen for its scientifically backed ability to promote gut and skin health. This multi-layered approach ensures that every ingredient works in synergy to optimize digestion, enhance nutrient absorption, and support overall well-being. B. Coagulans, the probiotic powerhouse, is one of the most resilient bacterial strains, capable of surviving stomach acid and colonizing the gut effectively. Studies have shown that B. Coagulans reduces bloating, supports immune function, and enhances nutrient digestion. Unlike many probiotic strains that require refrigeration, B. Coagulans remains stable at room temperature, making it more effective in supplement form. Babchi, the plant-based collagen booster, is a powerful antioxidant known for promoting skin elasticity, reducing inflammation, and supporting cellular regeneration. This ingredient enhances collagen production, which is essential for maintaining firm, youthful skin. Organic Ceylon Ginger and Lemon Balm play a dual role in reducing inflammation and supporting digestion. These ingredients improve gut motility, prevent bloating, and help break down food more efficiently, ensuring that the gut microbiome remains balanced and thriving. Slippery Elm Bark and Inulin act as natural prebiotics that fuel the growth of beneficial bacteria. They enhance gut barrier function, preventing toxins and harmful bacteria from entering the bloodstream, which is a major contributor to inflammation, acne, and digestive discomfort. By formulating Prime Biome with highly bioavailable, scientifically backed ingredients, the supplement delivers far superior results than standard probiotic capsules. Rather than simply replenishing bacteria, it creates an optimal gut environment where beneficial bacteria can thrive, repair gut lining, and restore digestive health—leading to better metabolism, clearer skin, and overall vitality.

Title: Jefferies tells tech giants that tariffs are a 'free hall pass' to reset their goals
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tariffs-free-hall-pass-to-reset-big-tech-profit-guidance-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-07T05:05:24Z
Full Content:
Market-rattling tariffs offer one upside: Companies can use the shifting financial landscape to adjust their performance goals, wrote analysts from Jefferies. In a note on Sunday, Jefferies analysts said that tariffs and related macroeconomic uncertainties are a "free hall pass" for companies to reset their guidance to more conservative figures. "Lower estimates that are more achievable tend to improve investor sentiment and, ultimately, lead to better share performance," said Jefferies analysts led by Brent Thill. The analysts cut their forecasts for 29 tech companies, including Meta, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. The analysts slashed Meta's stock price target for the second time in 10 days, this time from $725 to $600, a 17% cut. Meta is trading at $504, down 10% in the last five days. The analysts also slashed Meta's earnings per share for 2025 by 13%. Price targets are estimates of what an analyst thinks a stock is worth. Earnings per share is an important metric for investors because it assesses a company's profitability and financial health. Jefferies cut Microsoft's price target 5%, from $500 to $475. Microsoft is trading at $360, down 3.5% in the last five days. The analysts cut 2025 EPS estimates for Google and Amazon by 2% and 1%, respectively, but did not change their prices targets. Meta and Amazon get a lot of business from Chinese advertisers who are trying to reach American shoppers. Tariffs on Chinese goods may lead them to pause US advertising, marketing experts told Business Insider. For tech companies, the second quarter, which kicked off in April, "likely represents a peak period of uncertainty, followed by a potentially better 2H/Q4 after expectations are reset and there is more clarity around macro and tariff-related risks," the analysts wrote. The Jefferies analysts are not the only ones adjusting expectations. Businesses from Target to Best Buy to Ferrari have said that they will raise prices in response to increased import duties. Last week, President Donald Trump announced a spree of retaliatory tariffs on nearly every country. These included major manufacturing and raw material hubs, including a 34% tariff on China, 46% tariff on Vietnam, 26% on India, and 32% on Indonesia. On Friday, China pushed back with a 34% tariff on all US imports from April 10. The trade war panic spread to markets, and US stocks suffered their worst single-day losses since 2020 last week.

Thinking at the speed of AI? … “Bitcoin was the solution to being profitable on the Internet without advertising after all”— essay in eric kim voice … Curiosity —> these tech stocks,,,, are based on digital information ,, not physical products,, so why they dropping? Key Points Why Google’s and Meta’s Stocks Are Down Market Reaction to TariffsRecent tariff announcements by President Donald Trump, effective as of early April 2025, have led to significant market volatility. These tariffs, including a 10% blanket tariff on all imports and higher rates for specific countries like China (34%), have raised concerns about increased costs for companies with global supply chains. For Google, this means higher expenses for imported components used in hardware like Pixel phones and Chromebooks, potentially squeezing profit margins. For Meta, similar cost increases affect its hardware division, such as Oculus VR headsets. Impact on Advertising RevenueBoth Google and Meta rely heavily on advertising revenue, which could be indirectly hit by tariffs. Higher prices for imported goods may reduce consumer spending, leading to lower ad budgets from businesses, especially international advertisers. For Meta, it’s noted that 10% of its 2023 revenue came from Chinese companies advertising on platforms like Facebook and Instagram, which could be at risk if tariffs raise costs for these advertisers Why Trump’s Tariffs Are Rattling Even Meta. Global Operations and Economic UncertaintyBoth companies have significant international operations, and the tariff-induced economic uncertainty could disrupt global trade, affecting their revenue streams. This broader market unease, as seen in the sharp declines in major indexes like the Nasdaq (down 5.97% on April 3, 2025), has contributed to the stock drops Stocks ravaged by tariff fallout as global supply chains brace for impact. Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Google and Meta Stock Declines Amid Tariff Announcements This section provides a comprehensive examination of the recent declines in Google (Alphabet Inc.) and Meta Platforms’ stock prices, focusing on the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariff announcements as of April 6, 2025. The analysis considers market reactions, company-specific exposures, and broader economic implications, drawing on recent news and analyst insights. Background on Tariff Announcements On April 2, 2025, President Trump announced a sweeping tariff policy, imposing a minimum 10% tariff on all imports, with higher rates for specific countries, such as 34% for China, 20% for European nations, and 24% for Japan Apple leads a drop in tech stocks after Trump tariff announcement. This followed earlier tariff threats, including 25% on Mexican and Canadian imports and 10% on Chinese goods, announced in February and March 2025 Tariffs war: Meta and Google ‘most unfavorably positioned’ internet stocks By Investing.com. These measures have sparked significant market turmoil, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 3.98%, the S&P 500 losing 4.84%, and the Nasdaq plummeting 5.97% by April 3, 2025 Stocks ravaged by tariff fallout as global supply chains brace for impact. Google (Alphabet Inc.) Stock Decline Google’s stock, under the ticker GOOGL, experienced a notable decline, closing at $145.60 on April 4, 2025, down 3.40% from the previous day, following a broader market sell-off Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) Stock Historical Prices & Data – Yahoo Finance. Several factors contribute to this decline: Meta Platforms Stock Decline Meta’s stock, under the ticker META, also saw a significant drop, falling 9% on April 3, 2025, to $531.62, amid the tariff-induced market sell-off Why Trump’s Tariffs Are Rattling Even Meta. The reasons include: Comparative Analysis Both companies face direct impacts from tariffs on their hardware divisions and indirect impacts through their advertising businesses. Google’s exposure is heightened by its leadership in the tech stock slump, possibly due to its significant hardware costs and international revenue streams Google Leads Tech Stock Slump As Earnings, Trump Tariffs Fallout Weighs On Market. Meta’s vulnerability is noted in its reliance on Chinese advertisers, with specific figures highlighting the potential revenue hit Why Trump’s Tariffs Are Rattling Even Meta. The market’s reaction, as seen in the table below, underscores the severity of the tariff fallout: Conclusion The declines in Google and Meta’s stocks are multifaceted, driven by direct cost increases for hardware due to tariffs and indirect effects on advertising revenue from potential economic slowdowns. The market’s reaction to Trump’s tariff announcements has amplified these impacts, with both companies facing heightened uncertainty as of April 6, 2025. Further developments, such as retaliatory tariffs from affected countries and company-specific earnings reports, will likely influence future stock movements.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures.

Title: Tariffs: Are A Recession And Bear Market Inevitable?

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. President Trump’s much larger than expected “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on Wednesday, ... More April 4, sent stocks plunging as concerns about the economic consequences rose. Many economists forecast the high probability of a US and global recession if these tariffs are maintained. President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on Wednesday, April 4, sent stocks plunging as concerns about the economic consequences rose. The announced tariffs were significantly more sizable than anticipated. While the possible benefits from trading on fairer terms, reducing the U.S. trade deficit, and bringing more production back home are attractive, it remains unclear if tariffs will accomplish that goal, and there are short-term economic headwinds from the strategy. The easiest way to think about Trump’s tariff regime is in five parts: reciprocal, USMCA, China, sectoral, and commodities. The reciprocal portion comprises a 10% tariff on all goods imported into the U.S., and about 60 countries are subject to tariffs above 10%. For example, Vietnam was hit with a 46% reciprocal tariff rate. The universal 10% tariff rate became effective on Saturday, but the higher rate for those specific countries will be implemented on April 9. Canada and Mexico, who are part of the USMCA trading pact, were subjected to no further tariffs beyond the previously announced 25% tariff on all non-USMCA-compliant products. As expected, China was treated as a special case. Tariffs on Chinese goods will be at least 79% and could reach over 100% if the U.S. enforces the announced additional tariffs on countries buying Venezuelan oil. Lastly, specific commodities and economic sectors will be subject to a specified tariff rate rather than a country-specific levy. The commodities and sectors include steel, aluminum, lumber, copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and autos. For example, pharmaceuticals are currently exempt from any tariffs, which helps Ireland as a large exporter in that sector. Tariffs are paid on goods flowing into the country; some portion of that cost is almost certain to be passed along to the end consumer. Most expect companies to absorb some of the additional cost, but the split between the two groups is unclear. Since tariffs add to the costs, they can be considered a tax increase for economic purposes. Strategas Research Partners states these tariffs will be the most significant single tax increase as a percentage of gross domestic product since 1968. This tax increase is almost sure to reduce consumer spending and thus negatively impact U.S. economic growth. Furthermore, corporate earnings could be reduced if companies are unable or unwilling to pass along the full price increase. Largest US Tax Increases Since 1968 To put it into context, Strategas estimates that the revenue generated from the tariffs will be larger than all the tax revenue paid by companies. U.S. Estimated Tax Revenues These estimates are subject to significant uncertainty since the duration or further changes to tariff rates are impossible to estimate. Furthermore, possible retaliation or other second-order effects add to the difficulty in forecasting the likely impact with precision. The vast scale of the tariffs caused the JPMorgan economic team to raise the risk of recession this year to 60%, and it was stated that “these policies, if sustained, would likely push the U.S. and global economy into recession this year.” The increased risk of recession and lower earnings sent stocks 9.1% lower last week. The S&P 500 sits 17.4% below its mid-February high, close to the 20% decline from the peak that defines a bear market. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has fared worse and is deep into a bear market at 28.5% below its mid-December summit. Market Returns The Baa credit rating is the lowest level of investment-grade bonds. The spread is the yield investors demand beyond U.S. Treasury bond rates to compensate for the default risk from buying corporate bonds. These spreads expand when investors worry about more bond defaults, typically driven by deteriorating economic conditions. The spreads on Baa corporate debt increased last week reflecting the increasing fear of an impending economic downturn. Corporate Bond Spreads U.S. Treasury yields moved lower last week despite concerns that increased tariffs could cause a spike in inflation. The lower yields were caused by the combination of a flight to safety, reduced economic growth forecasts, and increased expectations for Federal Reserve short-term interest rate cuts. US Treasury Yields The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks underperformed the less economically sensitive defensive stocks by a wide margin last week. This suggests that economic fears are a primary cause of the stock plunge. Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive Stocks Looking at stock declines around recessions, the average decline in the S&P 500 is almost 30%. The average is dragged lower by the three most recent economic contractions, which were all atypical. Since stocks are already 17.4% below their peak, assuming we enter a recession, the decline would already be worse than three out of the last 12 recessions. S&P 500 Returns Around Recessions The analysis was widened to all the bear market-like stock declines, defined as a greater than 19% fall in prices, and since 1946, half of those plunges were associated with a recession. Not surprisingly, the declines related to recession tended to be more severe, including the deepest stock plunge during the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. Large Stock Declines Since 1946 As sure as the sun always rises, stocks eventually reward the optimist. Unfortunately, timing the rebound is impossible since waiting for good news rarely works. Stocks typically rebound sharply before the data or headlines begin to improve. On average, stocks bottom five months before the end of a recession and have generally risen by over 27% from the bottom before the recession even ends. Just as stocks tend to fall more sharply around recessionary periods, the rebound is typically more robust. S&P 500 Returns Following Large Decline Lows So far, the focus has been on the downside risk. With markets quickly pricing in a poor outcome and coming closer to assuming a recession, it is worth considering how things could turn around. There is always the possibility that Trump’s gambit succeeds in gathering quick concessions from other countries. Since the U.S. is a massive consumer market, one should not underestimate the economic pressure these tariffs will put on different countries. He could also decide that the economic pain was too great and reduce the tariffs unilaterally. The U.S. courts could also strike down the tariffs. While the tariffs seem sure to depress the economy indefinitely, economic activity could see a soft patch rather than a significant contraction aided by quick Federal Reserve rate cuts. As noted previously, the tariffs, if retained, are likely to produce significant tax revenue. This revenue should help the U.S. budget deficit. Furthermore, it opens the door to maintaining and lowering the current tax rates to offset this massive tax increase. The primary focus will likely remain on the fallout from the tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in U.S. policy and retaliation or concessions from other countries. Thursday’s consumer inflation (CPI) will be notable, though it will not reflect the impact of last week’s tariff announcements. Still, the underlying pace of inflation will be noteworthy for Federal Reserve policy decisions, and some of the earlier tariffs were in place, so clues as to the passthrough could be gleaned. Though last Friday’s March jobs release was better than expected, with an increase in 228,000 jobs according to the nonfarm payroll report, it was widely ignored as old news due to the tariff implementation. Markets moved quickly in reaction to the likely economic drag from the tariffs, with four expected rate cuts for 2025 and an over 100% probability of a rate cut on or before the mid-June Federal Reserve meeting. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected First quarter earnings season begins this week, with some large banks reporting on Friday. While current earnings always take a back seat to future guidance, this season's situation will be even more extreme, with investors trying to determine the upcoming earnings bite from the tariffs and any retaliation. Good companies typically have better pricing power and operational excellence, so they should be able to pass along or mitigate the increased costs compared to weaker businesses. While the data does not yet indicate a high likelihood of recession, the massive scale of effectively a tax increase from the expanded tariffs raises the risk. Notably, economic activity may see a brief improvement as companies and consumers move in advance of the tariffs. Still, that pull-forward of activity and the tariff-impacted higher prices for goods will weigh on future growth. The market is getting all vegetables from the tariffs, which have driven stock prices near bear market territory. Stocks have probably not fully priced in a recession, but quite a bit of bad news is priced into the outlook. There is room for optimism that investors could eventually get some dessert by way of tax cuts and deregulation, offsetting the drag from tariffs. History tells us that stocks almost always move higher before the headlines improve, so timing the rebound is nearly impossible. The short-term movements of stocks and the ultimate impact of the tariffs are impossible to predict, so investors should keep enough high-quality bonds and cash to cover upcoming expenses or liabilities. As a positive, bonds have returned to their status of providing a hedge to stocks during this downturn. While predicting the short-term price action of stocks is a fool’s errand, last Friday’s indiscriminate and panic selling does provide some optimism that stocks could find some footing this week. The real opportunity in any challenging period is in finding good companies where the stock market has allowed short-term hurdles or forced selling to send the valuation and expectations low enough to provide attractive long-term expected returns.

The iPhone is a quintessentially 21st century product — Californian in its creation and design and now enmeshed in the global economy.Apple makes most of its iPhones in China, though in recent years the Cupertino-based company has made more of its products in India, Vietnam and other nations. In all, the tech giant says it relies on more than 50 countries and regions to put AirPods, iPads and MacBooks in the hands of consumers.Now, that global supply chain is under siege.This week, President Donald Trump said he would impose a baseline 10% tariff on imports from all countries on Saturday. His administration also added tariffs of 34% on China, 46% on Vietnam and 26% on India.“Apple has nowhere to hide,” said Eric Harwit, professor of Asian studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. “No matter where they’re making their technology, they’re going to be suffering, they’re going to see higher costs.”Trump’s sweeping tariffs have rattled both investors and some of the world’s most valuable tech companies that have fueled the global economy and Silicon Valley’s growth. They’ve also raised questions about whether these global businesses will pass the higher costs onto consumers or slash their payrolls.Apple has been especially hard hit. Its stock plunged more than 9% on Thursday and dropped another 7% on Friday to close at $188.38.Share prices of other tech titans, including Google’s parent company Alphabet, Meta, chipmaker Nvidia and Amazon, also saw big declines, causing the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite to fall 5.8% on Friday — more than 20% below its record set in December. The unease reflects worries among investors that the tariffs could cause lasting damage, potentially making it harder for the U.S. tech industry to compete globally and dominate the race to deploy artificial intelligence technology, analysts said.The duties also are expected to drive up the costs of consumer electronics, including the iPhone, as products become more expensive to produce.“Technology pervades everyday life and these tariffs are attacks on consumer electronics,” said Todd O’Boyle, vice president of technology policy at the Chamber of Progress, a trade group. “They’re attacks on everything that we buy and that includes any foreign parts with global supply chains.”The levies could cause consumers to pay as much as $2,500 more for an iPhone, which costs roughly $1,000, depending on the model.Apple did not respond to a request for comment.Meta, Amazon and Alphabet also produce consumer gadgets but make billions of dollars annually from ads purchased by brands in other countries, which some analysts say could also drop if these advertisers pull back spending.Meta declined to comment, but its annual report cites the possibility that tariffs or a trade dispute could result in a drop of its China-based ad revenue. The company has also expanded production of its mixed reality headsets in Vietnam.Alphabet — which makes phones, earbuds, smart speakers and other consumer electronics — also has cited tariffs among the manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm its business. It did not respond to a request for comment.The White House said it’s imposing tariffs because it wants to shift more manufacturing jobs back to America.Relying too much on foreign producers could threaten economic security by “rendering U.S. supply chains vulnerable to geopolitical disruption and supply shocks,” Trump said in his executive order.“These America First economic policies delivered historic job, wage, and investment growth in his first term, and everyone from Main Street to Wall Street is again going to thrive as President Trump secures our nation’s economic future,” said White House spokesman Kush Desai.He cited recent multibillion-dollar commitments made by companies such as the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Apple to build more manufacturing plants in the United States.The tech industry has been bracing for more tariffs ahead of what the president dubbed “Liberation Day.”The Trump administration already imposed tariffs on certain auto parts and imported aluminum and steel, materials that tech companies use to build data centers that store and manage computer hardware and equipment.The administration spared those materials, along with copper, from its latest tariffs. Semiconductors that power electronics and AI systems also were excluded from what the White House dubbed “reciprocal tariffs.”Exactly how tech companies will respond to the costs of tariffs is still unclear. While Trump wants businesses to shift manufacturing back to the United States, they could also move production to places with lower tariff rates. It would take years for businesses to build new factories.It’s also possible these tariffs will not remain.During Trump’s first term, Apple got exemptions from tariffs imposed on imports from China for some of its products including its smartwatch. Trump’s tariffs in his second term go well beyond China, affecting more countries.Nick Vyas, founding director of the Randall R. Kendrick Global Supply Chain Institute at USC’s Marshall School of Business, said the Trump administration is signaling to businesses that simply shifting production to places outside China isn’t enough.“‘Every dollar that I open up my market for you, I need you to open up the market for me [to] the same degree,’” he said, describing Trump’s thinking.Some tech companies have made efforts to bring more manufacturing back to the U.S.Among them is Santa Clara-based chipmaker Nvidia, one of the world’s most valuable companies.While it appears Nvidia would be spared from the brunt of the tariffs because of the exemption to semiconductors, some industry observers said more tariffs could still be coming.Trump told reporters on Thursday that “chips are starting very soon” when asked if tariffs for chips are off the table.“We’re manufacturing in so many different places. We could shift things around,” Nvidia’s Chief Executive Jensen Huang said at a Q&A with analysts last month. “Tariffs will have a little impact for us short term. Long term, we’re going to have manufacturing onshore.”Apple in February said it would invest $500 billion in the U.S. that would go toward various efforts, including opening a manufacturing facility in Houston.The company said in its annual report that “substantially all” of its manufacturing is done by partners primarily located in mainland China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.Shifting where iPhones and other Apple products are made is not easy.China has engineers who can meet the high quality specifications on Apple products and the U.S. doesn’t have that great a number of engineers with those same skills, Harwit said.“It’s really that level of manufacturing expertise that Apple developed over many years that make it very difficult for Apple to give up on China and for the U.S. to find the skilled workers really needed in the United States to meet their needs,” he added.Daniel Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities, said that it would take Apple three years and $30 billion to move just 10% of their supply chain from Asia to the U.S. Plus, the iPhone’s price tag would increase to $3,500, he estimated.“The chances that Apple and the overall tech supply chain moves to the U.S. is a fantasy, fictional tale, unless you like $3,500 iPhones, $2,500 TVs and $300 AirPods,” Ives said. Apple makes most of its iPhones in China, though in recent years the Cupertino-based company has made more of its products in India, Vietnam and other nations. In all, the tech giant says it relies on more than 50 countries and regions to put AirPods, iPads and MacBooks in the hands of consumers. Now, that global supply chain is under siege.

We could shift things around,” Nvidia’s Chief Executive Jensen Huang said at a Q&A with analysts last month. “Tariffs will have a little impact for us short term. Long term, we’re going to have manufacturing onshore.” Apple in February said it would invest $500 billion in the U.S. that would go toward various efforts, including opening a manufacturing facility in Houston. The company said in its annual report that “substantially all” of its manufacturing is done by partners primarily located in mainland China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Shifting where iPhones and other Apple products are made is not easy. China has engineers who can meet the high quality specifications on Apple products and the U.S. doesn’t have that great a number of engineers with those same skills, Harwit said. “It’s really that level of manufacturing expertise that Apple developed over many years that make it very difficult for Apple to give up on China and for the U.S. to find the skilled workers really needed in the United States to meet their needs,” he added. Daniel Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities, said that it would take Apple three years and $30 billion to move just 10% of their supply chain from Asia to the U.S. Plus, the iPhone’s price tag would increase to $3,500, he estimated. “The chances that Apple and the overall tech supply chain moves to the U.S. is a fantasy, fictional tale, unless you like $3,500 iPhones, $2,500 TVs and $300 AirPods,” Ives said.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / APRIL 05 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR, who will share fresh data, perspectives and insights from the latest survey data.

Title: We just declared a trade war with the world

Enjoy your tax hikes, I guess! by Elizabeth Lopatto Enjoy your tax hikes, I guess! by Elizabeth Lopatto Nice economy you have there, said President Donald Trump’s administration. It would be a shame if something happened to it. The something, announced earlier this week, is a set of globally applied tariffs that make no sense on their face. No sane economist would endorse this. Through a combination of stupidity, incompetence and sheer gangsterism, the Trump administration has decided to levy a series of taxes that encourage blatant corruption, entirely fail to encourage American manufacturing growth, and leave people and companies poorer. That is, assuming that the taxes come into play at all. “This is the craziest of the crazy things we’ve seen thus far.” The central, persistent thing Trump seems to misunderstand about tariffs is that they are paid in the US by people in the US. A reasonable person might also remember that he tried them a few years ago in a trade war, to negative effect. We have, as a nation, shot ourselves in the dick. But don’t take my word for it! Here are some actual experts: There are hints that these tariffs are the buffoonish products of actual clowns. Take the tariffs on uninhabited islands, perhaps part of a trade war on penguins. Or the tariffs on an island occupied primarily by… a US military base. Then there’s the math behind the tariffs, which uses a puzzling formula that is remarkably similar to what several chatbots spit back if asked. The official formulation uses fancy Greek letters that effectively cancel each other out. The Financial Times — a funnier European version of The Wall Street Journal — translated it into “the stupidest chart you’ll see today.” The US has shaken the world’s confidence, and there are consequences for that Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary, doesn’t seem to know the answers to some basic tariff questions when he was asked about them, such as why Canada and Mexico were missing from Trump’s big nonsense tariff chart. Bessent also said he wasn’t part of the tariff negotiations with countries such as China, which is, frankly, weird. If the secretary of the treasury isn’t in the loop on tariff negotiations, uh, who is? The best-case scenario for all this, which still sucks, is that these tariffs — set to roll out in stages on April 5th and April 9th — will be abandoned. Trump has been threatening devastating tariffs on Mexico, Canada, or Colombia for months, only to back down at the first sign of resistance. Even the generally docile members of Congress are exhibiting signs of noticing this is a bad idea, and are at least paying lip service to restraining Trump’s power. But this frankly bizarre US vs. Everyone trade war could still be devastating to the US economy for years to come, even if the nonsense tariffs aren’t enacted. The US has shaken the world’s confidence, and there are consequences for that. Tariffs of any kind are disruptive. Since companies know they will be paying extra on items they import, they will pass the increase on to consumers, especially the poorest ones. They are likely to look for ways to cut costs and are unlikely to splash out on investments, says Meissner. Consumers are likely to do the same thing — cutting back on spending and holding onto necessities for longer than they would have otherwise, at least in part because they know there’s higher likelihood they’ll be fired if companies trim costs. Wages will likely remain the same, even as everything costs more The design of these new tariffs amplifies all of this. They’re global with a minimum tax of at least 10 percent, so companies can’t easily avoid them by moving supply chains around, like many did during Trump’s first trade war. And already we are seeing disruptions. The Nintendo Switch 2 has delayed preorders. Advertising businesses — like Meta, Google, and Amazon — are bracing for pullbacks on spending, especially from Chinese companies. Expect the price of groceries, clothes, and cars in particular to rise steeply. China has announced its retaliatory tariff, which will doubtless make those estimated price rises worse, and it may be the first of many countries to do so. These increases differ from the inflation that happened in the wake of COVID, Wolfers says. During that time, increased prices meant more money for companies, which could then be used to pay their employees more. But — because again, tariffs are a tax — this money will go straight to the Trump Administration. So wages will likely remain the same, even as everything costs more. Let’s talk for a hot minute about how the economy was doing pre-tariff. That dip in consumer confidence predated the latest tariff announcement. The actions of DOGE — firing and unfiring people, slashing social services, freezing previously-agreed-on grants, and generally running amok in the government — already shook consumers. In March, consumers’ expectations for the future were the lowest they’d been in more than a decade. In particular, people were nervous about their employment, which is the kind of thing that leads people to cut spending. A great deal of economics is basically just feelings. People are feeling bad, and the tariffs have them feeling worse. That’s the kind of thing that can spiral into a recession. JP Morgan’s macro economist had previously put the risk of a recession at about 40 percent. That’s not the only bank to do so — S&P Global, Goldman, Barclay’s, Bank of America and Deutsche Bank all agree that the risk is now considerably higher, though they disagree about how much higher. Those deals are “a way of making people beholden to you.” “The economy will perform worse with tariffs,” says Wolfers. That doesn’t necessarily mean a recession — it could simply mean slower growth — but nonetheless some economists, including Meissner, are expecting one. The ostensible reason behind these tariffs is to drive trade deficits to zero, but that makes no sense. A trade deficit essentially means that the US is receiving many goods and services from a country in exchange for pieces of paper, and they are receiving fewer goods and services (and thus giving us less paper), Wolfers says. Who cares? Economics isn’t a zero sum game. Many of our beautiful and brilliant Verge subscribers are in a trade deficit with The Verge, as they pay us $7 a month for our fine text products, and we buy zero dollars’ worth of things from them. Trump’s supposed ultimate goal is to bring manufacturing back to the US, but this isn’t going to happen either. That requires a less uncertain environment so companies will invest in building here, for one thing. It also requires a workforce — and it’s unclear why Americans would choose to work in manufacturing jobs as long as they have other options. Pragmatically, there are two things that explain these idiotic taxes. The first is that the Trump Administration is run by fucking bozos whose main qualification for their job is that they are Donald Trump’s spineless yes-men. The second is that Trump himself is by temperament a gangster, and he’s looking for leverage over every country and business that deals with the US. For instance, domestic farmers have been trying, unsuccessfully thus far, to get exemptions to tariffs so they don’t get “economically drawn and quartered” buying more expensive equipment while selling less food abroad, as one farmer put it. Trump has indicated he’s open to making deals to lower tariffs on individual countries. Uncertainty around bribery and exemptions actually make this clown show worse Those deals are “a way of making people beholden to you,” says Barrett. “I’m torn on whether this is just not well-thought out, or whether the uncertainty is part of the design.” What might one have to do in order to get such an exemption? Well, Colombia, Canada and Mexico provide examples: make a silly concession that lets Trump declare victory while changing nothing of note. After all, Trump is addled by television to a degree that as long as something sounds good on Fox News, it’s a win for him. As for individual industries, we already have indications in the form of tech moguls’ generous donations, generous production deals for Trump family hagiographies, killing DEI programs to make conservative ideologues happy, and massive pro bono law firm deals. But that uncertainty around bribery and exemptions actually makes this clown show worse. The idea behind tariffs is that in the long term, it lets American companies more effectively compete by raising prices on foreign goods. That gives American-made goods a chance to raise their own prices as well, juicing profits. But for that to happen, companies have to invest in building things in America — and as previously mentioned, the uncertainty about how long any given tariffs may last is likely to lead to more of a wait-and-see approach. Which… kinda defeats the purpose. “We have undercut the good faith and standing of the government in the world’s eyes.” Markets don’t like uncertainty. Neither do trade partners. America is likely to be hit with reciprocal tariffs, including from our allies, increasing the country’s pain. The Smoot-Hawley tariffs, famous to anyone who’s read Dave Barry Slept Here, introduced in 1930, are widely credited with worsening the Great Depression. The Trump tariffs are even bigger than those disastrous ones, based on nonsensical math that, for instance, hits an average EU tariff rate of about 2.7 percent with a “reciprocal” rate of 20 percent. The uncertainty also hurts the US politically. “We have undercut the good faith and standing of the government in the world’s eyes,” Barrett says. This undermines the dollar as a reserve currency for the world — one of its important functions for American political power, allowing us to borrow money more cheaply than most other countries. And indeed, the value of the dollar plummeted after the tariffs were announced — to a six-month low against the euro. The US’s bad behavior here is an incentive for people to move their money elsewhere. This is like watching a trainwreck in slow motion. Previously, the Trump administration weakened the dollar by announcing its crypto reserve. Musk unilaterally decided to tank our ability to work as the world’s R&D hub, attracting global talent and boosting our economy — and, additionally, taking an ax to American soft power in the process. Congress, which has chosen to abdicate control over spending, is effectively sidelined. Now the tariffs further endanger American wealth and safety. The only real questions are when we’re going to get the explosion, and how big it’ll be. © 2025 Vox Media, LLC. All Rights Reserved

Title: Trump tanks tech, Intel and TSMC do a deal, and OpenAI sets a fundraising record

UPDATED 11:57 EDT / APRIL 04 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Trump’s high tariffs, imposed late Wednesday, somehow managed to surprise investors, as tech stocks, and just about all stocks along with our 401(k)s, tanked Thursday and looked to be on an even steeper fall Friday — and many observers think even now the market isn’t pricing in the full impact. It’s hard to see how all this doesn’t drive us into a recession, and even harder to see why Trump is doing it. There’s no 3D chess here, only a checkerboard kicked onto the floor by a petty, malignant narcissist. (Ask me what I really think.) Meanwhile, it looks like those tariffs and the market meltdown have put the kibosh on planned initial public offerings, such as Klarna and StubHub. Stablecoin provider Circle finally filed to go public, but it will be interesting to see how soon that will happen now. Only sort-of bright spot: CoreWeave’s seeming dud looks a little better as its stock rose well above its initial price and remains there. Intel and TSMC have reached a preliminary deal for a joint venture to operate Intel’s chip factories, with TSMC taking a 20% stake. But how helpful this will be to Intel, and by extension U.S. chip manufacturing, depends on the details, which are sparse at this point. Elsewhere on the chip front, Qualcomm is getting more acquisitive, looking at buying chipmaker Alphawave, on top of buying Vietnamese artificial intelligence research group MovianAI earlier this week and Edge Impulse last month. OpenAI raised a ridiculous amount of money, a record-setting $40 billion — so much that it utterly skewed the latest venture capital stats. As capable as the company is, a valuation of $300 billion leaves absolutely no room for error, even if the errors aren’t its own. Indeed, Trump’s tariffs could slow down AI growth by making data center components more expensive, and already Alibaba and Microsoft are slowing their data center spending. Yet the AI funding keeps on coming: Alphabet spinout Isomorphic Labs also bagged $600 million and Runway AI $308 million. One rather concerning observation on generative AI from a new Gartner report: “Consumers are not chasing these features. As the manufacturers embed AI as a standard feature in consumer devices, consumers will be forced to purchase them.” Hmm. But AI is about to reset the cybersecurity industry, as Dave and Zeus outlined in the latest Breaking Analysis. And sure enough, a new study shows AI is now outperforming human red teams. Moreover, investors and cyber companies are betting on the reset, as ReliaQuest raised $500 million and Cyberhaven snagged $100 million for their AI-driven cyber tools, and others such as Solarwinds and Exabeam upped their AI games. The TikTok drama drags on as Trump said he would sign an executive order to extend the ban by 75 days. Here’s the news from this week from SiliconANGLE and beyond: OpenAI bags $40B in funding, increasing its post-money valuation to $300B Siemens to buy life sciences R&D company Dotmatics for $5.1B Alphabet spinout Isomorphic Labs raises $600M for its AI drug design engine AI video generation startup Runway raises $308M round backed by Nvidia Gartner forecasts worldwide generative AI spending to reach $644B in 2025 Interesting quote from Distinguished VP Analyst John-David Lovelock, building on the forecast that 80% of that spending will be on hardware such as servers, smartphones and PCs: “Consumers are not chasing these features.

Title: The Scoop: Brands’ tariff response aim to create stability amid market volatility

Also: White House may let China keep TikTok algo control; egg lobby aims to silence critics ahead of annual Easter egg roll. Brands and consumers are reacting to the volatile trade war escalating around the world. “Today is an across-the-board disruption of the American economy, so anything with consumer exposure is getting creamed,” Richard Kramer, an analyst at Arete Research, told the New York Times. In response, various brands and entire industries have wasted little time vocalizing the potential pain the duties will do to their business. Wine producers in France, for instance, have expressed concerns after the Trump administration imposed a 20% tariff. The Bourgogne Wine Board said that the U.S. is critical to the region’s wine sales, with the tariffs potentially costing Burgundy wines up to 100 million euros, according to the Associated Press. French winemaker Vincent Dampt told the AP that the tariffs were “bad news,” though he acknowledged it could have been worse. “I was really stressed with the possibility of having this 200% tariff,” he said, referring to the threat of even higher tariffs made earlier in the trade dispute between the U.S. and the European Union. Dampt noted that the tariffs will likely require slashing prices for the U.S. market. Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs dealt a major blow to the tech sector, making it one of the hardest-hit industries. Major technology firms, including Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon, lost nearly $1 trillion in market value, making it one of the sector’s worst days since the pandemic, the Times reported. While most companies have remained quiet in response, some spoke up, including Ford which launched a campaign in response to the new 25% tariff on imported cars and auto parts. As part of this initiative, Ford is offering U.S. customers the same pricing that its employees receive for vehicles. Why it matters: The Wall Street Journal that the tariff moves and corresponding market shake-ups have resulted in American consumers rushing out to purchase goods in sectors across the board – from yoga pants and TVs to automobiles. While others suspect that other big-scale items, like cars, may suffer major sales slumps. As a result, PR teams need to be particularly strategic with their approaches. They can’t overreach or risk alienating the White House, but they need to find ways to connect with consumers amid this market uncertainty. Ford, for example, is using a very pro-U.S. mantra as part of its campaign messaging: “From America. For America.” The promotion is on display at the top of the company website and across its social channels. The campaign also includes a TV spot voiced by actor Bryan Cranston, where he introduces the campaign as “an unprecedented moment in automotive history,” drawing attention to Ford’s significant U.S. operations. The campaign aims to get ahead of likely price increases, according to Rob Kaffl, Ford’s director of U.S. sales and dealer relations. “We understand that these are uncertain times for many Americans. Whether it’s navigating the complexities of a changing economy or simply needing a reliable vehicle for your family, we want to help,” Kaffl told The Drum. For PR teams, Ford’s approach provides an example of how to address potential consumer concerns with clear, direct messaging that emphasizes company values without alienating other key stakeholders. But this also can only work for companies with certain supply chains with strong American roots and pricing flexibility – others will have to get more creative. Other industries aren’t so lucky, though. Technology companies have been in the crosshairs of the White House, the EU and even China so they understandably aren’t in a hurry to be overly vocal about the subject. Instead, they’re allowing analysts to do a lot of the talking for them. It’s a long-game play, Kramer said. Apple has already finalized its manufacturing plans for 2026, so it can’t avoid tariffs until at least 2027, he said. “You cannot re-architect your supply chain in a quarter,” Kramer said.

April 03, 2025 15:44 ET | Source: Berger Montague Berger Montague PHILADELPHIA, April 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Berger Montague PC advises investors that a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) on behalf of purchasers of AppLovin securities between May 10, 2023 through February 25, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investor Deadline: Investors who purchased or acquired AppLovin securities during the Class Period may, no later than MAY 5, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. To learn your rights, CLICK HERE. Headquartered in Palo Alto, Calif., AppLovin is a developer of a software-based platform for advertisers. According to the complaint, AppLovin and senior management misled investors regarding AppLovin’s financial growth and stability, raising expectations as to the launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and the use of “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analysts Fuzzy Panda and Culper Research each published reports accusing AppLovin of, among other things, reverse-engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged that AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, thus presenting false installation numbers and profits. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025 – a decline of $46.06 per share, or 12%. To learn your rights or for more information, CLICK HERE or please contact Berger Montague: Andrew Abramowitz at aabramowitz@bm.net or (215) 875-3015, or Peter Hamner at phamner@bm.net. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. The lead plaintiff is usually the investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Communicating with any counsel is not necessary to participate or share in any recovery achieved in this case. Any member of the purported class may move the Court to serve as a lead plaintiff through counsel of his/her choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an inactive class member.

Title: The 10 Biggest Billionaire Losers Of The Tariff War So Far

ByGiacomo Tognini ByGiacomo Tognini, Forbes Staff. Mark Zuckerberg (left), Jeff Bezos (center) and Elon Musk (right) at Donald Trump's inauguration in January, alongside Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Bezos' fiancée Lauren Sánchez. Editor's note: This article was updated after the stock market close at 4 pm Eastern time on April 3, 2025. P resident Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that the U.S. would impose a flat 10% tariff on every country in the world, with higher rates for many of America’s largest trading partners including China, India, Japan, South Korea, the U.K. and the European Union. The news sent stock markets tumbling around the world on Thursday, with the S&P 500 index down 5% and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite down 6%. Stock markets in Japan, Hong Kong and Europe also suffered losses. That rout wiped a collective $270 billion from the fortunes of the world’s 3,000 billionaires. The biggest losers so far are the very richest people in the world, particularly those who have cozied up to Trump in recent times. No one has been hit harder than Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, whose fortune is down by $17.9 billion since yesterday’s stock market close, as shares of the Facebook parent plummeted by 9%. Zuckerberg, who sat next to Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk at Trump’s inauguration in January after Meta donated to Trump’s inaugural committee, has also met with the president at the White House several times since then—most recently on Wednesday. The second-biggest loser so far? Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, who has recently tried to grow closer to Trump, sitting in the second row behind the president at his inauguration in January after Amazon donated to Trump’s inaugural committee. In February, he announced the Washington Post—which he bought for $250 million in 2013—would change its opinion pages to focus on supporting personal liberties and free markets. A month later, he opined on tariffs, saying in an X post that the opinion pages would cover "the damaging and distorting effects if tariffs are used to pick winners and losers." With Amazon shares down 9%, Bezos is $16 billion poorer on Thursday. Larry Ellison, the founder of software giant Oracle, is down $9.9 billion, thanks to a 6% drop in Oracle stock. (He’s also a major shareholder in Tesla.) Unlike Bezos and Zuckerberg, Ellison has long been a major donor to Republicans, and he hosted a fundraiser for Trump in 2020 and dined with him at his Palm Beach club Mar-A-Lago last year. In January, he joined the president to announce a planned $500 billion investment in AI data centers in the U.S. alongside OpenAI’s Sam Altman and Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son. Elon Musk, the world’s richest person and Trump’s right-hand-man at the Department of Government Efficiency, is taking a beating, too. He has lost $8.7 billion, the fifth-most in dollar terms among billionaires, with Tesla shares slumping by more than 5% after a rough week in which the automaker announced its sales dropped by 13% in the first three months of the year. Meanwhile, French luxury tycoon Bernard Arnault, who was the world’s richest person until last year, suffered an $8.6 billion loss as shares in his conglomerate LVMH dipped by nearly 6%. Arnault made a public display of support for Trump in January, attending his inauguration alongside two of his five children, who are all executives at LVMH. Besides Bezos and Zuckerberg, many other tech barons—including Michael Dell, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang and Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin—also saw steep losses. At least five billionaires have fallen out of the ranks entirely today. The biggest loser in percentage terms has been RH (formerly Restoration Hardware) CEO Gary Friedman, whose net worth has fallen by 37%, to about $730 million. Shares in the upscale furniture firm have plunged by 40%, wiping $435 million from Friedman’s fortune. Other dropoffs made their fortunes in the clothing industry, which could also be hard-hit by tariffs: The U.S. is the largest importer of apparel in the world, sourcing most apparel from Asia, including 21% from China and 18% from Vietnam. It’s no surprise then that husband-and-wife duo Kenneth and Yvonne Lo, the Hong Kong-based cofounders of clothing manufacturer Crystal International Group, also have fallen below the $1 billion mark as shares in the Hong Kong-based firm tumbled by 23%. Crystal, which makes clothes for companies including Gap, Abercrombie & Fitch, Nike, Adidas and Puma, relied on North America for 38% of its revenues in 2024. Brian Hill, the founder of Vancouver-based women's fashion retailer Aritzia, also saw his net worth fall below $1 billion as the firm's stock cratered by 20%. And how is Trump faring amid the market upheaval? Not so bad. The president’s net worth is down by $40 million, to $4.6 billion, as shareholders pushed the price of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., the parent company of his social media outfit Truth Social, down 3%, less than overall market’s decline. Here are the 10 biggest billionaire losers as of the market close:

April 03, 2025 14:15 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On March 27, 2025, investors in AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) saw the price of their shares drop $65.92, wiping out about $20 billion of the company’s market value, after prominent short seller Muddy Waters Research revealed its short position in the stock. Muddy Waters’ report comes on the heels of a recently filed securities class action lawsuit, captioned Quiero v. AppLovin Corporation, et al., No. 4:25-cv-02294 (N.D. Cal.). The suit seeks to represent investors who purchased AppLovin securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Hagens Berman is investigating the claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Recent Development: On March 27, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a scathing report titled “AppLovin: Deep Data Analysis Shows APP is Just Another Scammy AdTech Company.” The report’s focus is in part on “retargeting” (a strategy that aims to re-engage potential customers who have previously interacted with a brand), “incrementality” (the additional or incremental lift in sales or conversions that a marketing activity generates), and AppLovin’s compliance with third party platforms’ TOS (terms of service). Muddy Waters contends that “APP e-commerce is Mostly Retargeting, Incrementality is Low, and it Clearly Violates Platforms’ TOS.” Muddy Waters alleges that: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Securities Class Action: The Muddy Waters report follows the filing of a securities class action complaint alleging AppLovin made false and misleading statements, while failing to disclose critical details about its flagship AXON 2.0 digital advertising platform. The company had heavily promoted the platform as "the best and fastest-growing product we’ve ever released." Investors were allegedly led to believe that the platform, which reportedly leverages “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would redefine the digital advertising landscape by enhancing ad placement efficiency and expanding into e-commerce and web-based marketing. However, the alleged narrative first shifted on February 26, 2025, when short sellers Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research published damaging reports that raised pointed questions about the company’s claims. Both research firms accused AppLovin of misleading investors regarding the platform's true capabilities and ethical practices. Fuzzy Panda Research alleged that the company violated app store policies by exploiting user data in questionable ways, predicting that tech giants Apple and Google would ban AppLovin from their app stores. Additionally, they accused AppLovin of “stealing data from Meta” as part of its e-commerce initiatives, foreseeing swift retaliation from Meta. Culper Research criticized the company for allegedly using AXON 2.0 as little more than a promotional facade to obscure the real drivers behind its business strategy. Culper's report further claimed that AppLovin's growth in mobile gaming has relied on “systematic exploitation of app permissions that enable advertisements themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations onto users’ phones, with just a single click – an event that is often inadvertent thanks to the Company’s notorious UX gimmicks” and that “each illicit install translates directly to profit.” “We are investigating claims that AppLovin may have misled investors about whether its growth may be attributable to illegitimate conduct,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: Trump's Tariffs Are a Bruising Defeat for the AI Industry

Time Published: 2025-04-03T17:29:13Z
Full Content:
If you follow tech stocks, there's probably one thing on your mind today: Donald Trump's tariffs. Yesterday, Trump announced his long-teased "reciprocal tariffs" on foreign imports coming into the US. Among them are a 32 percent tariff on Taiwan, 24 percent on Japan, 26 percent on India, and 34 percent on China — all major players in the global tech trade. As a result, the magnificent seven (M7) stocks — a stock trader term for the current whales of the tech industry: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla — are in a freefall today, as investors sell off their shares to brace for economic uncertainty. Among the tech industry, the stagnant AI sector is being hit particularly hard, as energy costs are anticipated to skyrocket along with the cost of important resources like steel, precious minerals, and semiconductors. As such, the cost to build and run data centers, the massive facilities that make AI computing possible, is expected to spike as the supply chain adjusts to the new normal. The vast majority of chips that power these data centers come from hard-hit countries like Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, and Vietnam, while the US makes just 11 percent of its chips at home. Trump's tariffs will force countries from those companies to hike their chip prices, and US companies will no doubt hike their prices to compensate, which will ultimately run off to consumers. That's a crushing blow for American AI companies, which were already facing the consequences of investor skepticism, lagging revenue, and a disappointing debut AI IPO by CoreWeave. Broader details about how these tariffs will affect the tech industry are foggy right now, as the stock market is moving at a breakneck pace, but there is one common theme: everything is down. Apple, for example, is heading for its biggest single-day plunge in stock price in nearly 5 years, dropping over 8 percent in just the first few hours of trading. Other M7 stocks are likewise plummeting, with Amazon down almost 9 percent, and Nvidia down by 6.7 at the time of writing. Tesla has continued its months-long cascade with a 7 percent dip so far. If you're wondering why we're doing this, you're not alone. For decades, the United States has sat atop the global economic food chain. Thanks to years of military and economic supremacy, the US dollar became the world standard, making it easy to export cheap consumer goods as high-paying American jobs became starvation industries in countries dependent on US trade. Trump's tariffs seem to be an attempt to reverse all that — an economic experiment that's never really been attempted at this scale. The entire move hinges on the bet that companies will shift production from places like Vietnam and Taiwan back into the US, a gamble which business leaders say comes with high costs and even higher risks. As Trump's tariffs aren't enshrined in law, they could be easily undone by the courts or the next presidential administration, making a long-term investment into, say, a $5 billion semiconductor plant on US soil hard to justify from a business standpoint — and at the end of the day, isn't what this is all about?

April 03, 2025 13:08 ET | Source: The Gross Law Firm The Gross Law Firm NEW YORK, April 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Gross Law Firm issues the following notice to shareholders of AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ: APP). Shareholders who purchased shares of APP during the class period listed are encouraged to contact the firm regarding possible lead plaintiff appointment. Appointment as lead plaintiff is not required to partake in any recovery. CONTACT US HERE: https://securitiesclasslaw.com/securities/applovin-corporation-loss-submission-form/?id=140436&from=3 CLASS PERIOD: May 10, 2023 to February 25, 2025 ALLEGATIONS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025.

Title: Trump Delusionally Brags About Tariffs as Stock Market Crashes

In the topsy-turvy world of the Trump administration, market panic and financial suffering are somehow good things. The president unveiled his economic agenda on Wednesday, revealing steep tariff hikes on practically every country in the world—regardless of whether the U.S. is running a trade deficit or surplus there. The news sent markets reeling. But by Thursday morning, Donald Trump was still celebrating his plan. “THE OPERATION IS OVER! THE PATIENT LIVED, AND IS HEALING,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “THE PROGNOSIS IS THAT THE PATIENT WILL BE FAR STRONGER, BIGGER, BETTER, AND MORE RESILIENT THAN EVER BEFORE. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!” But it’s unclear what metrics—if any—Trump used to measure his success. In reality, American businesses were seriously disturbed. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged by 1,500 points, about 3.5 percent, while the S&P 500 sank by 3.9 percent, setting both on pace for their worst day since the 2022 inflation crisis. The Nasdaq Composite tanked by more than 5 percent—bringing it down by 17 percent from its all-time high and down 13 percent year-to-date, the index’s worst performance since March 2020. Stock futures similarly plummeted. The value of the U.S. dollar dropped, and the price for a troy ounce of gold skyrocketed. Overnight, some of the country’s most competitive companies lost hundreds of billions of dollars. Nike and Lululemon, whose business models rely on international manufacturing deals in China and Vietnam, each lost more than 10 percent. Big-box stores also saw prominent losses: Best Buy, Target, and Home Depot lost 5 percent. The tech industry was similarly shaken: Apple was down 9 percent (worth approximately $300 billion in market value), Alphabet by 4 percent, Amazon by 7 percent, Meta by 7 percent, Microsoft by 3 percent, and Nvidia by 6 percent. Stores that rely heavily on imported goods saw their stocks tank too. Five Below lost 29 percent, Dollar Tree fell by 8 percent, and the Gap suffered a 22 percent loss. “The macro does not make sense, but the level of chaos and uncertainty, coupled with revaluing highly overpriced stocks, is hitting hard,” assessed CNBC analyst Ron Insana on Thursday. In a note to investors, JP Morgan said that Trump’s tariffs had a 40 percent chance of slingshotting the U.S. economy into a recession. JP Morgan underscored that the tariffs would cause a price surge—adding 2 percent to the consumer price index—and additionally raise taxes on Americans by $660 billion a year, “the largest tax increase in recent memory by a long shot,” reported CNN. “The impact on inflation will be substantial,” the analysts said, according to CNN. “We view the full implementation of these policies as a substantial macroeconomic shock.” A judge has ordered the Trump administration to release a man whom it wrongly detained and planned to deport to El Salvador. In a brief one-page filing overnight Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Rolando Olvera ordered that the government not only release Adrian Gil Rojas but that it buy him a ticket from Brownsville, Texas, back to New York. “The Court holds that the Petitioner is a Venezuelan national with a valid Temporary Protected Status and was wrongfully detained,” Olvera wrote. “The Court further holds that Respondents produced no evidence that Petitioner is a danger to the public,” he added. The government had argued that it should be allowed to detain and deport Gil Rojas because his TPS was set to expire on April 2, but his lawyer insisted that he was in the process of reopening his immigration case and that there was reason to believe that the Trump administration’s efforts to repeal TPS would fail. The lawyer was right: On Monday, a San Francisco judge blocked the government from revoking the protected status of about 350,000 Venezuelans. Judge Edward Chen slammed Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem for making “sweeping negative generalizations about Venezuelan TPS beneficiaries.” “Acting on the basis of a negative group stereotype and generalizing such stereotype to the entire group is the classic example of racism,” Chen said in his order. Gil Rojas, who said that he was arrested in New York last month, had been one of dozens of Venezuelan nationals detained by ICE who were sneakily moved closer and closer to an airfield in Harlingen, Texas, where the government staged a mass deportation to a notorious torture prison in El Salvador. On March 14, the plane that was supposed to take Gil Rojas suffered a mechanical issue and was rescheduled for the following day, giving his lawyer enough time to get Olvera to issue an order blocking his immediate removal. Gil Rojas was spared, unlike the dozens of others for whom due process was suspended under Donald Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime law he has reappropriated to aid in his mass deportation efforts. Olvera said that when Gil Rojas was returned to New York, he should be released on his own recognizance, and recommended that he wear an ankle monitor while his immigration case was pending. Earlier this week, the Trump administration admitted that it had wrongly deported Kilmer Armado Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national who had been granted protected status from being sent back to El Salvador. The government blamed an “administrative error,” and a judge ruled that the man could not be returned to the U.S. because the court lacked jurisdiction now that he was out of U.S. custody. Evidence that the government expedited the deportation of individuals who, as Olvera put it, were not a “danger to the public” only continues to mount. The government revealed that it had heavily relied on the tattoos to identify members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang the U.S. government has deemed a terrorist group, for deportation. But experts on the gang say that there are no tattoos that signify TdA affiliation. When Democrats attacked the Trump administration for the gargantuan price of eggs, the administration responded by importing vast quantities from Turkey and South Korea—two countries that were hit hard by the tariffs imposed on Wednesday. When asked about the issue, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins had no definitive answer on whether those imported eggs would be tariffed, reinforcing the multiple contradictions at the center of Trump’s isolationist trade war in the process. “President Trump yesterday gave you much praise talking about the job you’ve done in the last month and a half. I wanna talk about what you’ve done with eggs,” Fox Business’s Maria Bartiromo asked Rollins on Thursday. “National egg prices have declined 9 percent from last week, now averaging $3 a dozen, according to the USDA. Secretary … are eggs gonna be tariffed?” “Well, so, yeah let’s pivot to eggs.… Listen, we rolled out a very bold plan about a month ago.… Obviously it’s his vision we’re effectuating. The market reacted very favorably to it, [it] included some short-term imports but also included helping our poultry farmers in America,” Rollins answered, avoiding the question. “So as we repopulate our chicken farms and our egg-laying farms, I think we’ll see the price coming down even more.… Only good news on the egg front, and hopefully it will hold.” "Yes, I mean, all to be determined, we're all in negotiations, but yes, that's a possibility" -- Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins can't definitively answer a question about whether imported eggs are being tariffed pic.twitter.com/DeQf55p14J “So where are the eggs coming from that you’re importing?” Bartiromo asked. “Well, we’re importing from Turkey, we’re importing from South Korea, to a few other countries right now,” Rollins responded. “But again, at the end of the day. once our farms are repopulated … then we’ll go back to pretty much using all American-lain eggs.” “So then that means that eggs will be tariffed, if you’re taking them from Turkey, right? That’s part of the tariff plan,” Bartiromo pushed. There will be a 10 percent tariff on Turkey, according to Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement. “Well, yes, all to be determined,” Rollins replied, refusing to commit. ‘We’re all at negotiations, but yes, that’s a possibility.” Lower grocery prices—and lower prices in general—were a central theme of Trump’s campaign. Trump himself riffed on it at his “Liberation Day” announcement. But the new tariffs go directly against those promises, and even his inner circle are struggling to find a way to explain themselves. Got a problem with the Trump administration? Good luck. Recently laid-off employees from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services were told to contact Anita Pinder, the former director at the agency’s Office of Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights, with any complaints. A notice informed severed workers that they had 45 calendar days to contact Pinder following their termination date, listing Pinder’s name, email, and phone number. But those who knew Pinder said the directive came as a “gut punch,” according to The Washington Post, since Pinder died last year. “They couldn’t have run it past the people at CMS that were at the funeral and knew she died,” Karen Shields, one of Pinder’s former co-workers, told the Post. “This is a lack of communication. There is just a better way to do this.” Shields told the newspaper that it “pained” her to see Pinder’s name used in the reduction-in-force notices. “She would have been someone, even though her job would have been on the chopping block, she would have helped,” Shields said. The negligent error is just one recent instance in which the “shock and awe” of the Trump administration’s federal makeover has resulted in dud details and mass confusion. At the Food and Drug Administration, fired staffers were instructed to contact an Office of Equal Employment Opportunity employee that had left the agency more than a month ago, the Post reported. So far, the Trump administration—directed by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency—has fired more than 100,000 federal employees. But tens of thousands more government jobs are expected to be on the chopping block as Trump pursues a second round of “voluntary” buyouts. More than 10,000 jobs are expected to be cut at the Department of Health and Human Services, which encompasses the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed downsizing the agency’s 82,000-person workforce by nearly a quarter. A new Gallup poll shows that Americans are much more worried about Social Security and the economy. The poll, which measured opinions from March 3 to March 16, said that concern about the Social Security system is at a 15-year high, with 52 percent of Americans worried about it a “great deal.” Also ranking high were the economy at 60 percent, health care costs at 59 percent, and inflation at 56 percent. The worries reflect the Trump administration’s actions over the past few months, with cuts made to the Social Security Administration and the whiplash over the president’s bizarre tariff decisions. Those fears may get worse, as Trump went ahead with instituting aggressive tariffs against countries across the world on Wednesday, calling it “Liberation Day.” Meanwhile, Elon Musk, who is overseeing much of the administration’s policy, has called Social Security “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.” Markets have already plummeted Thursday, and criticism of the tariffs have even come within the Republican Party. Cuts to the Social Security Administration threaten to cause interruptions to benefits for 73 million retired workers, their survivors, and poor and disabled Americans. Last month, Martin O’Malley, who headed the SSA under President Biden, warned that the cuts could result in the agency missing payments for the first time in its 80-year history. It’s no surprise that the last time worries about Social Security were this high, the country was in the midst of a recession brought about by the financial crisis of 2008. The difference between now and then is that these worries are brought about by self-inflicted crises. Neither the SSA or the economy were in trouble prior to Trump’s inauguration. If the president continues on its current course, these worries could evolve into full-blown panic over losing Social Security and an even worse recession. The Trump administration is urging nervous voters to “trust” it in response to the impending economic fallout from the President’s tariffs on virtually all foreign imports. “To anyone on Wall Street this morning I would say trust in President Trump,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on CNN Thursday morning. “This is a president who is doubling down on his proven economic formula from his first time. We saw a wages increase, we saw inflation come down. We had a Trump energy boom, we had the largest tax cuts in history, and that’s exactly what the president intends to do.… The United States of America is no longer going to be cheated by foreign nations around the world.” The trade war that the president announced on Wednesday as “Liberation Day” has already tanked the stock market. The country is lurching into a recession, and there is little indication that things will improve anytime soon. Indeed, the tariffs announced on Wednesday are little more than a spiteful policy intended to stick it to friend and foe alike, ostensibly for the purpose of reinvigorating American manufacturing. This is virtually impossible, as these aggressive reciprocal tariffs will most certainly drive up prices for manufacturers and consumers across the country. But the administration would rather have you believe that the economic impact won’t be that bad, or even noticeable. “What can you tell the American people that—they just can’t afford an extra $3 here and there—about the government making up the difference from them?” Lawrence Jones asked Vice President JD Vance on Thursday morning. “Will costs go up at some point, will this just be temporary? Are we talkin’ three months or six months?” “We know a lot of Americans are worried. So we are working very hard to bring prices down,” Vance said. “What I ask folks to appreciate here is that we are not gonna fix things overnight.… We know people are struggling, we’re fighting as quickly as we can to fix what was left to us. But it’s not gonna happen immediately. But we really do believe that if we pursue the right deregulation, we pursue those energy cost-reducing policies, yes people are gonna see it in their pocketbook, they’re also gonna benefit from the fact that foreign countries can’t take advantage of us anymore, that means their jobs are gonna be more secure.” Neither Vance nor Leavitt actually explain how actions like hitting China with a 34 percent tariff will bring prices down for the everyday American, or how this country will be a self-sufficient producer in just a few years. This backtracking and gaslighting is a far cry from Trump’s promise to “immediately bring prices down, starting on day one.” In the scores of countries hit by Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs announced Wednesday, one was mysteriously—but not surprisingly—absent: Russia. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Axios Wednesday that Moscow had been spared from Trump’s tariffs because U.S. sanctions already “preclude any meaningful trade.” Similarly, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News that it wasn’t necessary to place tariffs on Russia because after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, trade between the U.S. and Russia had effectively dried up. But the claim that the U.S. doesn’t trade with Russia isn’t remotely true. In 2024, the U.S. imported $3 billion worth of goods from Russia, which was down from $4.6 billion the year before. While this number may be small in comparison to key trading partners such as Canada, which imported a whopping $412.7 billion worth of American goods in 2024, it is still significantly more trade than with other countries that Trump levied steep tariffs against. For example, Saint Pierre et Miquelon, a small French island territory off the coast of Canada, was hit with a whopping 50 percent tariff on imports to the U.S. The island, which has a population of roughly 5,000 people, imported only $100,000 worth of U.S. goods in 2024 and exported roughly $3.4 million worth of goods back. If that’s not low enough, Trump even listed several uninhabited islands as receiving a 10 percent tariff on imports to the United States: Heard Island and the McDonald Islands, an Australian territory that is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site for its “complete absence of alien plants and animals, as well as human impact.” Clearly, a lack of trade was not an actual consideration in the Trump administration’s decision to levy tariffs, though Leavitt claimed that existing sanctions were also why Cuba, Belarus, and North Korea were not included on the list. With Leavitt’s excuse falling flat, it seems increasingly likely that Trump has attempted to carve out a back door for Russian President Vladimir Putin to continue to do business with the U.S. as it makes an economic enemy out of every other country in the world. Canada and Mexico were also absent from the list because Trump had already hit them with 25 percent tariffs on all U.S. imports, according to Leavitt. The Trump administration seems to have destroyed global economies overnight while misunderstanding basic economics. In the wake of Donald Trump’s tariff announcement Wednesday, former New Yorker financial writer James Surowiecki pointed out that a column on Trump’s tariff sheet labeled “tariffs charged to the U.S.A.” was likely founded on bad math. “They didn’t actually calculate tariff rates + non-tariff barriers, as they say they did. Instead, for every country, they just took our trade deficit with that country and divided it by the country’s exports to us,” Surowiecki argued. “So we have a $17.9 billion trade deficit with Indonesia. Its exports to us are $28 billion. $17.9/$28 = 64 percent, which Trump claims is the tariff rate Indonesia charges us.” “What extraordinary nonsense this is,” he added. That would mean that the Trump administration imposed earth-shattering tariff hikes on the rest of the world without looking at the whole picture. Mainly, that the administration calculated the tariffs charged by other countries by only looking at goods provided, rather than the combined value of goods and services—something that “most economists seem to think is an odd way to calculate tariffs,” according to BBC Verify’s Shayan Sardarizadeh. The White House initially refuted the tariff theory. White House Deputy Press Secretary Kush Desai posted on X that “we literally calculated tariff and non tariff barriers.” But in an attempt to prove his point, Desai grabbed a formula from the US Treasury website that actually proved Surowiecki’s. Sardarizadeh broke it down. “∆τᵢ = (x-m) / (ε x φ x m),” he shared. “The formula includes ‘x’ for exports and ‘m’ for imports.” “But it also has ‘ε’ for ‘price elasticity of import demand’, set at 4 by the Treasury; multiplied by ‘φ’ for ‘elasticity of import prices’, set at 0.25 by the Treasury, which means they basically cancel out each other as 4 x 0.25 = 1,” Sardarizadeh continued. “So, in effect, all you’re left with in the formula is exports - imports / imports, which is what X users and journalists had accurately pointed out all along.” But the administration’s bad math only matters so much to the tariff-heavy agenda. Even in countries where the trade deficit was less than 10 percent, or even in countries where there was a surplus, Trump still tacked on a 10 percent tariff. Donald Trump announced a range of tariffs on nearly every country in the world—including, inexplicably, some practically uninhabited islands, one of which is home to a U.S. military base. The British Indian Ocean Territory, a small cluster of islands in the South Indian Ocean, was hit with 10 percent tariffs on U.S. imports from the Trump administration Wednesday as part of its Liberation Day announcement. The islands are mostly uninhabited, save for approximately 3,000 U.S. and U.K. military personnel who are stationed at a joint Navy Support Facility on the island Diego Garcia. Trump’s tariffs would mostly affect the service members there. Another roughly 1,200 people live on the country’s Chagos Archipelago. As one might expect from the name, the territory is owned by the United Kingdom, which Trump hit with a 10 percent tariff, relatively low compared to other countries. Trump also announced 10 percent tariffs on the Heard Island and McDonald Islands, an uninhabited Australian territory that was listed as a Unesco World Heritage site for its “complete absence of alien plants and animals, as well as human impact.” Australia was saddled with a 10 percent tariff, as well. It’s unclear whether the tariffs on these territories would compound to 20 percent. Crucially, it’s unclear that anyone thought about this at all. Online, some speculated that the tariffs were doled out according to internet domains, and that because the Heart Island and McDonald Islands use a different domain (.hm) than Australia, (.au) they were considered different countries. That seemed to be the only explanation for levying a tariff on a territory that has no economy to speak of. Donald Trump claimed Wednesday that the United States entered the Great Depression as a result of turning its back on the policy of placing tariffs on other countries in favor of an income tax. During a winding speech to mark the so-called Liberation Day, Trump presented an alternative history where steep tariffs, like the ones he’d come to celebrate, could have prevented the worldwide economic disintegration of the early twentieth century. “From 1789 to 1913 we were a tariff-backed nation, and the United States was proportionately the wealthiest it has ever been,” Trump said, adding that the U.S. was “collecting so much money, so fast, we didn’t know what to do with it! “Then, in 1913 for reasons unknown to mankind, they established the income tax so citizens, rather than foreign countries, would start paying the money necessary to run our government,” he said. “Then in 1928 it all came to a very abrupt end with the Great Depression, and it would have never happened if they had stayed with the tariff policy; it would have been a much different story,” Trump said. “They tried to bring back tariffs to save our country, but it was gone. It was gone. It was too late, nothing could have been done.” Trump’s revisionist history is designed to promote his economic agenda—not reflect what actually happened. Not only could tariffs not have prevented the Great Depression, they made it even worse. In 1913, as the result of struggling farmers and Democrats advocating to establish an income tax, Republicans put up an income tax amendment, hoping that it would be rejected—it wasn’t, and the Sixteenth Amendment became law. At the same time, Congress passed the Underwood Simmons Tariff Act that lowered tariff rates from 40 percent to 27 percent, in a Democrat-backed effort to promote free trade. Crucially, tariffs were raised again in 1921, after Republican President Warren Harding entered the White House and began a reinvigorated era of protectionism. In 1930, Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which raised tariffs in all sectors and is considered to have exacerbated the worldwide economic downturn that lasted from 1929 until 1939, by undermining international trade and affording little protection to domestic producers. Smoot-Hawley was disastrous not only for the U.S. economy, tanking U.S. exports to Europe from $2,341 million in 1929 to just $784 million in 1932, but also for global trade, which declined by a whopping 66 percent between 1929 and 1934, according to the U.S. Office of the Historian. The effects of Smoot-Hawley were so awful that it marked the end of steep tariffs in American trade policy for the rest of the twentieth century. Trump’s baseless insistence that lowered tariffs led to the Great Depression is representative of his entire economic policy, and just how untethered from reality it has become.

Amazon and Meta shares are down about 7 percent. by Todd Haselton Shares of Apple, Amazon, and other tech stocks are getting walloped on Thursday as the markets digest the impact of President Donald Trump’s new round of tariffs announced on Wednesday evening. Shares of Apple were down about 9 percent on Thursday morning, which would mark the biggest drop in about five years if it holds until the close, according to CNBC. Amazon shares dropped about 7 percent. Both companies rely heavily on imports from other countries, like China, on which Trump plans to impose a 54 percent tariff beginning April 9th. Apple also manufactures some products in countries like Vietnam, on which a 46 percent tariff was announced. The tariffs, if they aren’t walked back, could mean increased prices on electronics for consumers or slimmer margins for companies like Apple and Amazon if they choose to eat some of the costs. Apple has typically had a gross margin, the amount of cash it gets to keep after it sells stuff, of around 38 percent, though it has been higher. Wall Street is likely concerned about lower demand if Apple has to increase the price of Macs, iPhones, iPads, and other products. Other big tech companies were impacted as well. Shares of Nvidia were down more than 4 percent on Thursday morning while Tesla stock was also down about 4 percent, giving up most of its Wednesday gains. Shares of Meta are down about 7 percent.

Title: Apple leads Magnificent 7 stock drop amid Trump tariffs

Apple (AAPL-3.08%) shares were down by 8.3% during afternoon trading on Thursday, leading the decline of Magnificent 7 stocks after President Donald Trump announced “reciprocal tariffs” following the market close on Wednesday. At mid-day on Thursday, Amazon was down by 7.2%, Nvidia was down by 6.2%, Meta was down by 5.8%, Tesla was down by 4.3%, Alphabet was down by 3.1%, and Microsoft was down by 1.4%. During pre-market trading, Apple had been down by 8.2%, while Amazon (AMZN-1.06%) was down by 6.7%, Meta (META-0.03%) was down by 6.6%, Nvidia (NVDA+1.18%) was down by 6.2%, Tesla (TSLA-2.17%) was down by 6.2%, Alphabet (GOOGL-0.18%) was down by 3.8%, and Microsoft (MSFT+0.50%) was down by 1.9%. Meanwhile, S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures all pointed to a lower opening on Thursday morning. The Trump administration’s tariffs are being applied on a country-by-country basis, and are calculated by combining the rate of tariffs, non-monetary barriers, “and other forms of cheating.” Trump said the U.S. will charge other countries “approximately half” of their charges. “April, 2, 2025 will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America’s destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again,” Trump said on Wednesday, adding that his tariffs are the “declaration of economic independence.” Baseline 10% tariffs are expected to go into effect on Saturday at 12:01 a.m. ET, while reciprocal levies are set to be effective on April 9 at 12:01 a.m. ET. Jefferies (JEF-1.28%) analysts said in a note on Thursday that the Trump administration’s 54% tariffs on China and 26% tariffs on India “caused a selloff on the Apple supply chain.” The analysts said it is currently unclear if Apple will be exempted from the tariffs as it was during Trump’s first administration in 2018, and that the company’s plan to invest $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years could “help it get exemption.” “The simple thought is likely that Apple’s products will be subject to this tariff, and thus demand will get hit and thus the supply chain will suffer,” Jefferies analysts said. “[I]n the worst case,” the analysts estimated that if Apple’s iPhone imports are subject to the 54% tariff on China and the company absorbs the cost to avoid a negative impact on sales volume, its full year net profit could be reduced by 14%. “It is possible for AAPL to raise price and pass on some tariff burden to high-end consumers without affecting volume too much (upside to our forecast), but that may be offset by the fact that some non-iPhone products would also create additional [negative] impact on AAPL’s earnings,” Jefferies analysts said. However, the analysts said that even if Apple is exempted from the reciprocal tariffs, “it will need to accelerate its supply chain diversification efforts, and thus needs to pay its suppliers better and give more share to those who could help AAPL achieve this objective.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Will Trump's New Tariffs Drive Up Headset Prices In The US?

With a 54% tariff set to apply to Chinese-made goods and 46% for Vietnam, will the price of VR headsets in the US soon increase? Enacted by President Trump via executive order yesterday, the new import tariffs are set to take effect from April 9, next Wednesday. They apply to goods manufactured in these countries, not just sold by companies from them. And while there are some exemptions, VR headsets aren't on that list. Most headsets today, including Apple Vision Pro, Meta Quest, PlayStation VR2, and Pico, are made in either China, Vietnam, or both. While Trump had already placed a 20% tariff on Chinese imports in recent months, headset companies could plausibly absorb these added costs, and he hadn't yet applied a tariff to electronics made in Vietnam. But with tariffs moving to 54% and 46% for China and Vietnam respectively, it seems very unlikely that most headset companies will be able to avoid increasing prices. For example, analyst estimates placed the cost to Meta of each Quest 3 at around $430, excluding R&D and other indirect costs, and thus the new tariffs should bring this to around $650, significantly higher than its current $500 price. Could we soon see a $700 Quest 3, $500 Quest 3S, and PlayStation VR2 move back to $550? Even the US-assembled Bigscreen Beyond 2 would feel the heat from the tariffs. Most of its components, such as its expensive micro-OLED displays from China, would be affected. And this cost would almost certainly need to be passed on to the buyer. Meta has been moving around half of Quest production to Vietnam, to avoid the tariffs Trump was expected to place on China. But with Vietnam hit too, this diversification won't make a major difference. Not every company will necessarily need to increase prices, though. The same analyst estimates place the cost to Apple of each Vision Pro at around $1700, also excluding R&D and other indirect costs, and thus Apple could still be making an acceptable profit even if the cost soon rises to around $2500. Consumer hardware companies typically build up large stock pools in each country they sell in, so we're not expecting to see Quest and PS VR2 prices suddenly jump next week. But eventually the US stock of these headsets will run out. And when new units are coming in at around 50% higher cost, how could the current US prices hold? Of course, it's possible that President Trump scales back or cancels these tariffs entirely by then. Trump's administration has described tariffs as a mechanism of putting pressure on countries to make certain policy changes, and perhaps the US president decides his aims have been satisfied before US headset stockpiles run out. The rapidly shifting global political landscape makes definitive predictions here impossible, so we'll be keeping a close eye on the situation over the coming weeks and months.

Title: How and where Trump's new tariffs affect Apple

AAPL: 173.12 ( 8.34 ) Copyright © 2025 Quiller Media, Inc. All rights reserved. Donald Trump's signed tariff plan - Photo credit CNBC Last updated 5 days ago President Trump's new tariffs go far beyond China, and hit every nation in the world. Here's how badly Apple has been hit, and where it has been struck globally. In February 2025, the Bank of America said that the impact of tariffs on Apple would be significant. Before the extent of the tariffs were announced, Bank of America estimated that they would mean Apple may have to raise iPhone prices by 10%. Apple has yet to make any announcements about price changes. It might have attempted to swallow small increases in component costs, but it is unlikely to absorb these massive ones. The company has previously made a point of how it has kept the iPhone costs the same for years — although only in the US. That means it has borne at least some inflation costs mostly because of smart buys of commodities like DRAM and NAND, and also any added expense of new technologies being added to the iPhone. But those costs will continue to rise anyway, and the addition of tariffs may mean even Apple cannot avoid raising its prices. Previously Apple was able to negotiate a tariff exemption during President Trump's first term, but as yet it has failed to do so again. So at present, Apple will have to pay the tariffs on everything it imports into the US. And, there is some double-dipping involved, perhaps. An iPad assembled in Vietnam will also incur a cost for having a processor manufactured in Taiwan. It should be clear that a TSMC processor made in Arizona would face no tariff, but materials imported to make those chips will be impacted. And, for now, it appears those chips are completed in TSMC's facilities in Taiwan, at least until the AMKOR finishing plant comes completely on line. Taking each country's tariffs separately, though, this is what CNBC says Apple now has to pay for devices or components from each of its biggest supply regions. ChinaChina currently accounts for: 80% of Apple's whole production capacity Assembly of 90% of all iPhones Assembly of 55% of Macs Assembly of 80% of iPads Overall, it's estimated that around 40% of all of Apple's suppliers are based in China. Tariffs that Apple will have to pay to import goods from these suppliers are immediately set to 34%. IndiaCurrently India assembles approximately 10% to 15% of iPhones, but has been expected to reach up to 20% by the end of 2025, helped by the country cutting import taxes for Apple and others. Apple is now required to pay a tariff of 26% on imports from India. VietnamVietnam has benefited from an increase in investment from Apple, partly to avoid the expected tariffs, and partly to avoid overall US/China trade tensions. It has also been intended to reduce Apple's over-dependence on China as a single supply source. Now, however, Apple will have to pay an import tariff of 46%. This will affect: Assembly of 20% of iPads Assembly of 90% of Apple Watch Other major countriesApple produces some Macs in Thailand, which now has a 36% tariff. Malaysia also manufacturers the Mac, and is facing a 25% tariff. The vast majority of processors in all Apple devices, though, are manufactured by Taiwan's TSMC. And imports to the US from Taiwan now have a 32% tariff. The impact on Apple, and market sentimentAnalysts are starting to chime in on what they expect to see from these tariffs. Krish Sankar from TD Cowen believes that US sales account for about 31% of total revenues with about 75% coming from hardware products. He estimates that every 10% of tariffs would impact Apple's net income by about 3.5% in FY25 and FY26 EPS. He also estimates that Apple will raise prices to offset tariffs, and estimates that every 10% of tariffs levied can be offset by an about 6% increase in product average selling price. Samik Chatterjee from JP Morgan has also come up with the 6% figure. Analyst Daniel Ives from Wedbush calls the tariff plan "illogical," and "economic Armageddon" for the global economy, and specifically, the American consumer. Ives reiterates that when other countries are hit with tariffs, it's ultimately the American consumer that bears the entire brunt of the bill. He still considers Apple a focus to own in a stock portfolio, but is expecting to see at least in the short term a 10% hit. Trump's new tariffs immediately caused stocks in technology firms to fall. Apple saw the largest drop of any technology firm. Apple's stocks fell almost 7.5% in extended trading as of 8 AM Eastern Time on April 3. It's not clear what the market sentiment will be when the market opens. In comparison, Nvidia's shares dropped 4%, while Tesla lost approximately 4.5%. Amazon, Meta, and Google parent company Alphabet all lost between 2.5% and 5%, while Microsoft is down almost 2%. Unless Apple stocks rebound during regular trading, this fall is the company's worst since September 2020. That was when the iPhone 12 launch was delayed because of COVID disruption.

Would welcome comments. Maybe I’m missing something but Tim meeting with Trump and in Feb and then both announcing the 500b US investment has total exemption written all over it. Again am I missing something? Would welcome comments. Apple's Mac sales are rising sharply just as Trump's tariffs guarantee that the the global PC market will have one of its most unpredictable years ever. The Asahi Linux project is having trouble bringing the operating system to M4 Macs, with some chip changes making working with the latest Apple Silicon models a lot tougher. Apple Arcade is set to see five new games roll out this May, including a new entry into the "What the" series and a new Lego endless racer. Built with Thunderbolt connectivity and tuned for macOS, QNAP's latest network attached storage devices are tailor-made for multiple Final Cut editors and creative pros. Earnings for what may be Apple's last quarter without massive tariffs, that saw releases of iPhone 16e, updated Macs, and new iPads will be announced on May 1, followed by a conference call. Apple Vision Pro introduced new ways of controlling apps through gestures, but it appears that Apple wants to extend that to controlling any device it makes. A questionably sourced report claims a new version of the Apple Vision Pro is in mass production now, with the new model supposedly going on sale within a year. A social media post has gone viral with the claim that Apple will be releasing emojis of major pop stars as part of iOS 18.5. The only problem is, the prediction is complete crap. Apple and Michigan State University are opening a free manufacturing training academy in Detroit to help U.S. suppliers modernize their operations. Ming-Chi Kuo's Apple commentary is normally fairly insightful, but his latest batch on how Apple can shoulder President Trump's tariff burden is short-sighted, and doesn't make a great deal of sense. The Keychron Q3 HE is a great compact mechanical keyboard, one that offers lots of customization thanks to its Hall Effect switches.

Title: The Biggest Billionaire Gainers 2025

Time Published: 2025-04-03T10:30:00Z

ByRoy Canivel ByRoy Canivel, Forbes Staff. The past 12 months have been very good to the planet’s billionaires. There are more of them (3,028) than ever before and they’re richer than they’ve ever been (worth a combined $16.1 trillion). Overall, the billionaire class is nearly $2 trillion richer than last year. But the big gains have not been shared evenly: $453 billion of the increase comes just from ten super fortunate people. These ten biggest gainers on Forbes’ 2025 World’s Billionaires list each added tens of billions—or, in one case, more than $100 billion—to their already-massive fortunes since the 2024 ranking. They made their money in retail, finance and, mainly, tech. No one in the world gained more than Elon Musk, who took back the title of richest person in the world after a stellar year for his startups SpaceX and xAI, plus a 12-month rise in the share price of Tesla, despite a recent selloff. Musk is an astonishing $147 billion richer this year. He’s the only billionaire to add nine figures to his net worth since the 2024 list. Eight of the ten are American citizens, either through birth or, in the case of Musk, naturalization. The other two are Lei Jun, a Chinese citizen whose fortune grew by 300%, to an estimated $43.5 billion, thanks to higher demand for his company’s electric cars, and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, a Canadian citizen worth an estimated $62.9 billion amid a jump in crypto markets. Tim Pannell for Forbes The only daughter of Walmart founder Sam Walton (d. 1992), she became the world’s richest woman in September, her first time since 2022. She hit the $100 billion mark in November as Walmart shares climbed to record highs. The stock is up more than 53% since last year. Best known for spearheading the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in her family’s hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas, Walton has given away an estimated $1.7 billion, including her most recent gift, disclosed in an August filing, of $249 million to help fund the new Alice L. Walton School of Medicine, also in Bentonville. Changpeng Zhao, who goes by CZ, is the founder and former CEO of Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world. In November 2023, Zhao stepped down as Binance's CEO as part of a sweeping settlement with U.S. authorities. He pleaded guilty to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and was sentenced to four months in prison. He also paid a $50 million fine. He’s richer this year amid bull crypto markets and a Forbes investigation into his vast holdings of Binance’s exchange-issued token, BNB. Despite demands from the Justice Department to break up Google, the Alphabet cofounder and board member is $30 billion richer thanks to a 30% rise in the Google parent company’s shares. Page, who stepped down as Alphabet CEO in 2019, is reportedly working on a new company that plans to apply AI to manufacturing. The youngest son of Walmart founder Sam Walton (d. 1992), he retired from Walmart’s board in 2016 and yielded the seat to his son Steuart. He remains the chairman of the family's Arvest Bank Group, which boasts assets of $26 billion. The cofounder of Susquehanna International Group, one of Wall Street's largest and most successful trading firms, has invested in hundreds of private companies globally, including TikTok parent ByteDance, its most valuable holding based on Forbes reporting. He’s benefitted as ByteDance’s valuation has hit $312 billion in private markets amid a bidding war over TikTok. In September, he became the first member of America’s richest family to join the $100 billion club, on the back of rising Walmart shares. The eldest son of Sam Walton (d. 1992), he retired from the board in June 2024, after more than four decades as a director. Visual China Group via Getty Images From budget-friendly smartphones to electric vehicles, Xiaomi has come a long way since Lei Jun cofounded the Hong Kong-listed company in 2010. With the firm’s electric vehicle venture seeing higher demand for its cars, shares have climbed more than 300%. Last year, Lei was worth an estimated $10.9 billion. He is also the chairman of Hong Kong-listed software firm Kingsoft and an investor in JOYY Inc., a Nasdaq-listed live-streaming and social media platform formerly known as YY.com. Not long ago, Mark Zuckerberg banned President Donald Trump from Facebook and Instagram following the January 6 riots. One presidential election later, the Meta founder has friended Trump, including putting pro-Trump entrepreneur Dana White on Meta’s board in early January and cohosting an inauguration reception for the president alongside several Republican billionaires. Shares of his social media giant have surged nearly 25% since last year’s list, making Zuck the second richest person in the world for the first time. Ellison, too, has been sticking close to Trump. He may not have been front and center among tech tycoons during the president’s inauguration, but he stood a few feet away from Trump when the president soon announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative backed, in part, by Ellison’s software firm Oracle. Ellison’s net worth went up by $51 billion this year thanks to a growing AI business that helped push Oracle’s stock price up by 40%. AFP via Getty Images Thanks to an incredible $147 billion year, Elon Musk, yet again, is the richest person alive. All of his largest assets have gone up in value: Tesla stock is up 50% since last year’s list, rocket maker SpaceX is worth $350 billion, nearly double its valuation from last year, and Musk’s artificial intelligence business, xAI, raised $6 billion from private investors at a $50 billion valuation in November—then, last week, Musk announced that xAI was acquiring X (formerly Twitter) in an all-stock deal that valued X at more than what Musk paid in 2022, and boosted xAI’s valuation to an apparent $80 billion–a $30 billion bump from just three months ago.
