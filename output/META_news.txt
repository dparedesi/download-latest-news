[+] Illustration by Dominika Zarzycka/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) The biggest market loss in history happened on Jan. 27, with with Nvidia stock plummeting 17% by the close of U.S. markets. This led to a record $589 billion loss in market capitalization. Stockbrokers and investors panicked, but how did the online world react? Well, it did what it does best: joked about the whole debacle. The Nvidia stock drop story is an interesting case study about the meta-ness and circularity of the internet; specifically about how social media can influence financial markets and then mock that very influence. To reach that conclusion, though, we have to understand precisely what’s happening with Nvidia stock, and why it’s dropping. Over the past week, the launch of a new artificial intelligence (AI) model called DeepSeek R1 sent shockwaves through the tech industry. Without getting bogged down in detail, this open-source AI is reported to deliver the same performance as models from other companies, such as OpenAI, but at a far lower cost. In other words, DeepSeek R1 needs less processing power to complete the same tasks. Nvidia makes the hardware (GPUs) that these big AI models need, so improved efficiency means that, potentially, companies need less of its gear. This is one of the key reasons why Nvidia stock nosedived. Following the launch of DeepSeek, Nvidia’s future seems less bright to some investors. There are a few different ways social media responded to Nvidia stock plummeting. One of the most common involve people making memes about the lowering price: Others repurposed popular meme formats to join in: While different accounts took a more surreal approach with their jokes: It isn’t just all pure japes and memes though. Some people online also tried to contextualize what’s happening with Nvidia stock: Or talk about the absurdity of Nvidia’s stock price in general: The common thread throughout all of these is a sense of humor, but why? What’s happening for the internet to act this way? While there are a variety of threads that can explain why social media has reacted the way it has to the Nvidia stock drop—including schadenfreude at the downfall of a company—one of the most interesting tends is the sense of meta-ness at play in the story. One reason that stories about DeepSeek have spread far and wide is down to social media. Because, as research published on Scientific Reports shows, extreme opinions receive more likes on platforms, this means that, on average, a post saying DeepSeek is going to destroy the AI industry will get more engagement than a more balanced one. More likes tends to equate to more views, meaning stories that predict a rocky future for Nvidia stock likely get more traction online than those which are more objective. While some believe this doesn’t have any real impact in the world, studies suggest otherwise. Social media has been shown to directly impact stock prices. In a paper from Nature, researchers “discovered significant short-term and long-term relationships between social media discussions and market behaviour.” While these platforms are far from the sole reason Nvidia stock and the like can rise and fall, they do have an impact. And this is where things get particularly interesting. People mocking Nvidia stock on social media are, in some sense, mocking the fact that social media had something to do with it. The internet is almost like a snake eating its own tail. Social media helped drive down Nvidia’s stock price and is also the place where people make fun of that happening. It’s a never-ending cycle. Ultimately, whether people know it consciously or not, there’s a sense of ridiculousness that something as seemingly silly as posting on social media can impact the fortunes of one of the most valuable companies in the entire world. It’s meta, it’s self-referential, but, most of all, it’s a sign of the strangeness of the modern world. So what comes next? It’s likely that, at some point, Nvidia stock will recover, but after that? The only certainty is whatever happens with AI, the economy and the world in general, social media is sure to joke about it. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Chinese Quant Whiz Built DeepSeek In The Shadow Of a Hedge Fund Rout

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Three years ago, Liang Wenfeng’s quantitative hedge fund firm apologized profusely to investors for losing money during a tumultuous period for China’s stock market. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials NYC Subway’s Most Dangerous Stations Are on Lexington Ave. Line Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump’s Spending Freeze Memo Newsom Enlists Magic Johnson, Guggenheim CEO for LA Rebuilding It was a surprising stumble for Zhejiang High-Flyer Asset Management, which used artificial intelligence to pick stocks and had grown rapidly to become one of the country’s largest quant funds. As the firm navigated through that crisis and its assets shrunk by more than a third from a peak of more than $12 billion, behind the scenes Liang was laying the groundwork for a new AI startup, DeepSeek. DeepSeek, which grew out of High-Flyer, is now threatening to upend the global artificial intelligence supply chain and challenge the seemingly-unassailable US lead in critical frontier AI technologies. The sudden popularity of the 20-month-old firm’s breakthrough technology and its namesake app sparked a massive US and European stock rout on Monday, wiping out close to $1 trillion in combined market value from chip giant Nvidia Corp. and other peers. It has also drawn shock and awe over how Liang, an engineering graduate who has never studied or worked outside of mainland China, pulled off such a feat. He has demonstrated that with local artificial intelligence engineers, constrained access to the latest semiconductor technologies and limited resources, it is possible to match — and even surpass — the best in the field. “Every country in the world could have that kind of a project going on, if they can acquire the talent and be able to work on it, of course. The rest of the industry is going to learn from this,” said Shuman Ghosemajumder, co-founder and CEO of Reken, a San Francisco-based AI startup. The question now gripping investors, companies and policymakers is whether artificial intelligence requires hundreds of billions of dollars in capital expenditure to come up with the latest innovations and vanguard AI models — and whether export controls can hold off Chinese competition. Follow The Big Take daily podcast wherever you listen. Liang has been compared to OpenAI founder Sam Altman, but the Chinese citizen keeps a much lower profile and seldom speaks publicly. “OpenAI is not a god and cannot always be at the forefront,” Liang told Chinese media outlet 36Kr in July 2024. The previous year, Liang said more investment doesn’t necessarily lead to more innovation. He has also opined on how Chinese companies have long been mostly followers as opposed to technology innovators. The problem has been a “lack of confidence and not knowing how to organize high-density talents to achieve effective innovation,” he was quoted as saying. An Outlier Liang was born in 1985 in Zhanjiang, an economically poor city in China’s southern Guangdong province. His father was an elementary school teacher. He studied electronic engineering at Zhejiang University, a prestigious college in the city of Hangzhou, and also earned a master’s degree in information and communication engineering there. High-Flyer was as much an outlier in China’s quant industry as DeepSeek is to the global AI industry. Liang and two of his former university classmates started dabbling in domestic stocks in 2008. Unlike the founders of most Chinese quant funds, none of them had overseas or institutional trading experience. The trio tried different strategies from discretionary trading to arbitrage, before settling on using a systematic approach to implement trading ideas in 2015, the year they set up High-Flyer. They initially built a model based on price-and-volume factors, before trying machine learning in 2016. The new tool allowed the firm to dig deeper to find new factors and identify “non-linear” connections between factors, its chief executive officer Simon Lu said in an interview in 2020. The founders integrated machine learning into High-Flyer products in 2018. AI allowed High-Flyer to achieve “a lot of innovations” and develop a multi-strategy, multi-cycle investment model to “pile up” returns from different sources of returns, according to a 2020 brochure for the firm. Its flagship product benchmarked against the CSI 500 Index integrated low-risk strategies like intra-day trading, allowing it to beat the gauge by a combined 120 percentage points in the previous three years, it showed. High-Flyer grew assets quickly as a result, reaching more than 90 billion yuan in 2021 before it stumbled later that year. In December 2021, after experiencing record drawdowns at some funds, High-Flyer said its artificial intelligence mistimed some trades and performed poorly during periods of large stock swings. “We feel deeply guilty,” it told investors. The firm also stopped accepting fresh inflows and said it would reduce its assets under management and adjust its strategies. Three months later, its marketing head warned that certain volatility-sensitive clients should redeem their money — a highly unusual move. Last year, High-Flyer said it would wind down products that had made two-way bets on the markets, and focus on “long-only” strategies in which it took only bullish positions on stocks. Its assets under management have dropped to around 60 billion yuan. Research Funding DeepSeek’s research was funded by High-Flyer’s R&D budget, Liang said previously. It drew computing resources from the quant fund, which had amassed 10,000 Nvidia GPUs in 2021, prior to US bans on exports of sophisticated Nvidia chips and other graphics processing units. Liang recruited engineering talent almost exclusively from China. Many were fresh out of top universities, interns in their final leg of doctoral studies and Olympiad medal holders. “He’s a nerd but nerd in this context is not a negative,” said Zihan Wang, a Ph.D. student at Northwestern University who did a six-month internship at DeepSeek in 2024. Wang said Liang ran many experiments on his own, and DeepSeek operated much like a research lab. “It started small, but as they got real progress, they started to get excited,” he said. The startup began periodically releasing models, seemingly impervious to — even stirred up by — the US ban on exports of cutting-edge AI accelerator chips. DeepSeek released its R1 advanced AI reasoning model on Jan. 20, the same day Donald Trump was sworn in as America’s 47th president. Earlier that Monday, Liang attended a closed-door business symposium in Beijing that was hosted by Chinese Premier Li Qiang. There, experts in technology, science, education and other fields offered their opinions and suggestions for a draft government work report, according to the official Xinhua news agency. Video footage on YouTube shows Liang sitting across the table from Li and speaking, with the Chinese leader nodding attentively. Significantly, DeepSeek open sourced its R1, allowing researchers and developers to freely use, modify and commercialize the model. That sent a signal that it wants to collaborate and innovate with others in the global AI community. Liang stands out among Chinese entrepreneurs because of that non-commercial goal, his laser-focus on research and the realization of Artificial General Intelligence, said Thomas Qitong Cao, assistant professor of technology policy at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. Liang is assumed to own 51% of High-Flyer. That would give him a stake worth $71 million based on a comparative analysis, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. If DeepSeek reaches the same potential as OpenAI, valued at roughly $150 billion, the founder could potentially be in line for a massive windfall. Some have questioned whether Liang’s DeepSeek is as promising as it appears. Shortcomings include the startup’s infrastructure’s ability to handle global traffic waiting to try its service, or the app’s handling of sensitive subjects such as the 1989 protests in Tiananmen Square and queries on Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Experts have also questioned the assumption that DeepSeek was building with 10,000 A100 Nvidia chips, with analysts like Dylan Patel speculating that DeepSeek needs at least 50,000 of Nvidia’s far-more powerful chips, the H100s. Meta Platforms Inc., for instance, operates the equivalent of 600,000 Nvidia H100s. Still, Liang is prompting a rethink and re-calibration in the global AI ecosystem. It’s made obvious that the “The AI race won’t be won by creating the most sophisticated model; it’ll be won by embedding AI into business systems to generate tangible economic value,” said Mike Capone, chief executive officer of Qlik, a data analytics and artificial intelligence platform. --With assistance from Biz Carson, Pui Gwen Yeung and Pei Yi Mak.

The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market Monday, initiating a massive selloff led by Nvidia, which roared back Tuesday, recovering almost half of its record-setting losses. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generate by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner, Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models and I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months is “our leading AI companies taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company. Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history. Broadcom had slipped 16% as of 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, 9:30 a.m. ESTDomestic leaders in AI showed stinging losses at market open Monday as Microsoft dropped 4% and Tesla slipped 2%, with semiconductor chip architect Nvidia diving 12% and other big chip stocks like Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company falling more than 10% apiece. Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model "AI's Sputnik moment." Jan. 25The DeepSeek mobile app became the No. 1 app in iPhone stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the U.S. and the U.K. Jan. 22ByteDance, another Chinese company, revealed an update to its flagship AI model and word started circulating that the new overseas products posed a strategic threat to the U.S. tech giants pursuing AI dominance. Jan. 20DeepSeek launched its R1 advanced reasoning model, claiming it rivaled OpenAI's o1 product on several performance benchmarks and was created for far less money than spent by American companies like Microsoft and Meta. The selloff stems from weekend panic over last week’s release from the relatively unknown Chinese firm DeepSeek of its competitive generative AI model rivaling OpenAI, the American firm backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, and its viral chatbot ChatGPT, with DeepSeek notably running at a fraction of the cost of U.S.-based rivals. The idea of a rival undercutting the largely U.S.-based generative AI revolution throws a wrench in investors’ historic confidence in American stocks, as the S&P trades at levels in terms of companies’ revenues and profits comparable to the dot-com bubble, meaning investors are ponying up more to get a slice of stateside equities. DeepSeek is “bad news” for American tech behemoths with “plans to dominate the AI market with their expensive AI services,” cautioned Yardeni. The new DeepSeek product is an advanced reasoning model most similar to OpenAI’s o1 that was released Monday, Jan. 20. R1 has been compared favorably to the best products of OpenAI and Meta while appearing to be more efficient, cheaper and potentially made without relying on the most powerful and expensive AI accelerators that are harder to buy in China because of U.S. export controls. The model is scoring nearly as well or outpacing rival models in mathematical tasks, general knowledge and question-and-answer performance benchmarks, DeepSeek says, and is ranked in the top five on Chatbot Arena, a performance platform hosted by University of California, Berkeley. Don’t “buy into the doomsday scenarios currently playing out” about DeepSeek, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note to clients, adding the “panic over the weekend seems overblown.” DeepSeek’s assertion it cost just $5.6 million in computing power to develop its model is “categorically false,” according Rasgon, who said the misleading figure does not account for other “substantial” costs related to its AI model’s development. American AI billionaires like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang theorize DeepSeek actually owns more than $1 billion worth of Nvidia equipment. DeepSeek is a new entrant to the AI large-language model arms race involving OpenAI, Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet. The AI battle came to a national stage last week when President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion joint venture building out the infrastructure necessary to power OpenAI’s artificial general intelligence initiatives. In his speech last Tuesday, Trump specifically called out the importance for the U.S. to beat out China on AI, saying about the technology: “We want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor and others are competitors.” Major tech figures including billionaire Trump allies Marc Andreessen and Vivek Ramaswamy each likened DeepSeek’s new technology to a “Sputnik moment” for American AI. Nvidia, which was the world’s most valuable company prior to Monday’s slide, designs a majority of the semiconductor and data storage technology necessary for large-scale AI, including DeepSeek’s, enjoying an explosion in profits as companies around the world fought over Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The magnificent seven includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, accounting for about $17 trillion of market value between the seven giants. The AI revolution boosted American stocks to record leadership in the global stock market, with U.S. companies accounting for 67% of the world equity market at the end of 2024, according to MSCI. The S&P is up 201% over the last decade through Friday, trouncing the 8% loss for China’s leading CSI 300 index and the 33% gain for Europe’s Stoxx 600 over the period, according to FactSet data. Monday’s selloff sets the stage for a notable week for Big Tech stocks. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will all report fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, while Apple will follow Thursday.

Title: Streamlined $MIND AI Presale to 100x as DeepSeek Beats the Big Boys of AI

The launch of DeepSeek V3 has sent shockwaves through the US stock and crypto markets. Word that the AI model built by Chinese startup DeepSeek is superior to its American counterparts has made the US markets and AI industry see red. Not only is DeepSeek the most resource-efficient AI model the world has seen, but it outperforms the likes of ChatGPT 4o, Claude, and Llama. And that isn’t even the most scary part. DeepSeek offers superior results at a fraction of the cost of competitors like OpenAI, Google, and Meta. While OpenAI has been raising $18B with the goal of plowing it into massive data centers and other infrastructure, DeepSeek has built a super-efficient model for a mere $5.5M. This single move has shattered the myth that AI is a capital-intensive domain reserved for the big players. Investors are worried that DeepSeek’s cost-effective model could disrupt the current AI landscape, leading to increased competitive pressure on established players. This has resulted in a negative sentiment towards tech stocks and cryptos, particularly those heavily invested in AI. As a case in point, AI leader Nvidia was the worst-hit company on NASDAQ yesterday. Its shares fell by 17%, the worst one-day fall to date. This wiped off $593B in the company’s market cap, the highest capitalization loss ever for a Wall Street company. AI crypto tokens also experienced the impact of the DeepSeek saga. The AI category on Coingecko is down 6% in the last 24 hours, with AI agent coins losing 11% and AI agent launchpads losing 24.6%. After a hit like this, it’s going to take some real self-reflection to get the AI agent market back on track. Moving ahead, it’s possible that only tokens with a notably streamlined and elegant approach will attract investment. Cue MIND of Pepe ($MIND). $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that monitors, participates in, and propels meme coin discussions and interactions on various social media platforms. Through listening, collaborating, and learning, it forms its own conclusions and delivers real-time actionable insights for $MIND token holders. The $MIND AI agent comes as the answer to the information overload in the crypto space, which makes it difficult for the average investor to identify the best assets to invest in. $MIND – a self-evolving AI agent, solves this through hive-mind analysis. $MIND is a streamlined AI token project that provides token holders with early access to insights, opportunities, and trends. The $MIND presale is currently live and has already raised $4.1M so far. You can buy the token from the official presale website for just $0.0032144 right now. However, the next price increase is set to take place in less than 2 days, meaning this may be the lowest price you’ll ever get $MIND for. Moreover, since it’s still early days for the presale, investors can choose to stake their holdings and earn a sizable reward of 537% APY. The developers have reserved 15% for staking rewards. 20% of the token supply has been kept aside for marketing, which is going into building a strong community of $MIND holders. The project already has around 14K followers on X and an active Telegram community. Another 10% of the supply is reserved for listing and 30% for long-term project development.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. DeepSeek, a little-known Chinese start-up whose affordable technology matches the likes of the most formidable American tech titans such as OpenAI and Meta Platforms, has raised investor concerns over the necessity of pouring billions of dollars into research and development. The Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) company released its open-source reasoning model, R1, earlier this month. The model's capabilities roughly match those of advanced models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google while having significantly lower training costs. "The impressive performance/cost dynamics have raised investor concerns about the necessity of the billions of dollars of capital expenditures by large US tech companies and the billions more they are planning to spend on generative AI in the coming years," said Malik Ahmed Khan, an equity analyst from Morningstar. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. Large US tech companies may follow suit and replicate some of the AI training techniques that DeepSeek leveraged to drive the cost of R1 down, he said in a research note on Tuesday. When DeepSeek launched, it quickly became the most downloaded app in Apple's US AppStore. The better-than-expected performance of DeepSeek led to a sell-off of Nvidia and tech peers on Wall Street on Monday. Its shares plunged 17 per cent to US$118.58, erasing almost US$600 billion of market value. Nvidia's logo and a decreasing stock graph are seen in this illustration taken January 27, 2025.

Photo: Reuters> "This was bound to happen, and it could have come from anywhere," said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at French investment bank Natixis. "It came from China, all the more so, in a way, to see a correction." Wei Sun, principal analyst for AI at Counterpoint Research, said the Nvidia sell-off reflects shifting perceptions in AI development. "DeepSeek's success challenges the belief that larger models and more computing power drive better performance, posing a threat to Nvidia's GPU-driven growth strategy," Sun said. "It also questions the need for massive investments like the US$500 billion Stargate Project. By achieving cutting-edge results with fewer resources, DeepSeek highlights the potential of efficient innovation over sheer scale, marking a turning point in the AI race." While the correction may have been an initial reaction to the hype around DeepSeek, Garcia-Herrero said she does not believe it would be a permanent correction. "The US is going to double down on investment in AI," she said. "There will be more money in the US for the AI industry, if not more than before. Because [previously] it was kind of the understanding that China was falling behind, especially in Gen AI and now we see that was not the case." US President Donald Trump has called DeepSeek's strong showing a "wake-up call" and "positive" for America's tech sector. He also warned that he would slap tariffs on foreign-made semiconductors, including chips made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company or TSMC, if they do not start producing them stateside. Despite DeepSeek not having access to leading AI accelerators, such as Nvidia's best Hopper and Blackwell products, its large-language model (LLM) is believed to be on par with some of the best models released by OpenAI and others. "DeepSeek raises concerns that future LLMs will be developed with fewer AI GPUs from Nvidia, lower capital expenditure from hyperscalers, and perhaps less of a need for a massive energy buildout in the US," said Brian Colello, strategist at Morningstar. Nvidia on Monday responded to the hype generated by the Chinese AI firm and said its advances show the usefulness of its chips for the Chinese market and that more of its chips would be needed in the future to meet demand for DeepSeek's services. DeepSeek claims to have trained its model on only 2,048 Nvidia H800 GPUs over a two-month period, which at US$2 per hour explains the US$5 million headline number announced. This is driving a reassessment of AI investment strategies, focusing attention on the sustainability of AI capital expenditures, the AI competitive landscape, and the monetisation of AI, according to Richard Clode, a portfolio manager at Janus Henderson. DeepSeek is charging significantly less than OpenAI to use its models - about 20-40 times lower- according to Janus Henderson. This adds to concern about AI monetisation, given the extraordinary amounts of capital outlay deployed in the West. Last year, OpenAI said it closed a long-awaited funding round at a valuation of US$157 billion, including the US$6.6 billion the company raised from an extensive roster of investment firms and big tech companies, including Microsoft and Nvidia. Analysts say that DeepSeek shows a Chinese company can compete with the best-of-breed AI companies in the US, despite the current restrictions on Chinese access to advanced US semiconductor technology. "The breakthrough could be that DeepSeek can achieve a state-of-the-art model without state-of-the-art equipment," according to analysts at ING. According to ING, the market needs to price in a slower adoption rate of high-performance computing and revenues of companies selling AI models.

Title: OpenAI’s Sam Altman vows ‘better models’ as China’s DeepSeek disrupts global AI race

Time Published: 2025-01-28T07:34:02Z
Full Content:
OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman said he would fast-track product releases and “deliver much better models” after advances by Chinese start-up DeepSeek undermined Silicon Valley’s lead in a global artificial intelligence arms race. DeepSeek’s generative AI chatbot, a direct rival to ChatGPT, is able to perform some tasks at the same level as recently released models from OpenAI, Anthropic and Meta, despite claims it cost a fraction of the money and time to develop. The release of DeepSeek’s R1 model last week and its rise to the top of Apple’s App Store has triggered a tech stock sell-off. Asian tech shares fell on Tuesday in the wake of a Wall Street rout overnight. The Nasdaq fell 3 per cent and US chipmaker Nvidia, which produces the chips used to train large AI models, slumped 17 per cent, losing $600 billion (€570 billion) in market capitalisation. On Monday evening, Altman wrote on X that DeepSeek’s model was “impressive, particularly around what they’re able to deliver for the price”. He added: “We will obviously deliver much better models and also it’s legit invigorating to have a new competitor!” Altman, who last week announced that investors including SoftBank would spend up to $500 billion to build a network of data centres to power its AI models, added that computing resources were “more important now than ever before”. Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon and Oracle have earmarked $310 billion in 2025 for capital expenditure, which includes AI infrastructure, according to data compiled by Visible Alpha. Such estimates have been based on the premise that huge amounts of computing power will be needed to advance AI capabilities. But DeepSeek’s ability to compete on a fraction of the budget of OpenAI — which was recently valued at $157 billion — and rivals Anthropic, Google and Meta, has raised questions about the vast sums being poured into training systems. “The winners won’t be the ones burning the most cash,” said Aidan Gomez, founder of Toronto-based Cohere, which builds large language models for enterprises. Instead, he said, they would be those “finding efficient solutions”. The advances by DeepSeek have also exposed risks for venture capitalists who put almost $100 billion into US AI start-ups last year. “There’s now an open weight model floating around the internet which you can use to bootstrap any other sufficiently powerful base model into being an AI reasoner,” said Jack Clark, co-founder of Anthropic, in a blog on Monday. “AI capabilities worldwide just took a one-way ratchet forward,” he added. “Kudos to DeepSeek for being so bold as to bring such a change into the world!” DeepSeek’s success has complicated the argument that massive cash piles create an unassailable advantage, which has helped leading Silicon Valley labs raise tens of billions of dollars over the past year. “If you’re Anthropic or OpenAI, attempting to be at the forefront, and someone can serve what you can at a tenth of the cost, that’s problematic,” said Mike Volpi, who led Index Ventures’ investment into Cohere. The sudden release of DeepSeek’s latest model surprised some at Meta. “The main frustration is, ‘Why didn’t we come up with this first?’ when we have thousands of the brightest minds working on this,” said one Meta employee. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg — who last week said he expected to allocate up to $65 billion in capital spending to expand AI teams and build a new data centre — has advocated for open source, positioning Meta at its forefront in the US. “We want the US to set the global AI standard, not China,” the company said in response to DeepSeek. Meta’s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun said “running AI assistant services for billions” would still require large levels of computing power. Rival company insiders and investors have expressed scepticism about the low costs cited by DeepSeek in developing its models. In December, the company said its V3 model, which its app’s chatbot runs on, cost just $5.6mn to train. However, it added that this figure was only for the final training run, not the complete cycle, and excluded “the costs associated with prior research and...experiments on architectures, algorithms, or data”. DeepSeek has attributed its success — despite using inferior chips to its US competitors — to methods that allow the AI model to selectively focus on specific parts of input data as a way of reducing the costs of running the model. For its latest R1 model, it used a reinforcement learning technique, a relatively new approach to AI in which models teach themselves how to improve without human supervision. The company also used open-source models, including Alibaba’s Qwen and Meta’s Llama, to fine tune its R1 reasoning model. The technical advances and investor interest in DeepSeek’s progress could light a fire under AI companies. “In general, we expect the bias to be on improved capability, sprinting faster towards artificial general intelligence, more than reduced spending,” said research firm Rosenblatt on Monday. Researchers and investors, including Marc Andreessen, have drawn parallels between the race between the US and China on artificial general intelligence and its competition with the Soviet Union during the cold war, both in space exploration and nuclear weapons development. Stuart Russell, professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, said the race to AGI was “worse”. “Even the CEOs who are engaging in the race have stated that whoever wins has a significant probability of causing human extinction in the process, because we have no idea how to control systems more intelligent than ourselves,” he said. “In other words, the AGI race is a race towards the edge of a cliff.” - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025Sign up for the Business Today newsletter and get the latest business news and commentary in your inbox every weekday morning Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Trillion-dollar disruptor: China's DeepSeek upends AI world overnight
URL: https://newatlas.com/ai-humanoids/deepseek-ai/
Time Published: 2025-01-28T07:17:00Z
Full Content:
The US AI giants got a wake-up call this week, when fledgling Chinese firm DeepSeek wiped a record-breaking trillion dollars off the value of heavyweights like Nvidia and OpenAI. The technology's gatekeepers are rattled – and they have good reason to be, as DeepSeek's model R1 shows how the costly existing roadmap is no longer the only way forward. This game-changing event is on the back of the company's latest AI model – DeepSeek-R1 – being released for use on smartphones across the globe, following desktop launch on January 10. DeepSeek has been on our radar for a few weeks, after its chatbot V3 dropped on December 26 and was reported to have performed as well as the leading US GPTs (generative pre-trained transformers) – something that few news outlets covered at the time (including us). With the AI frontrunners – all US companies – developing new features at breakneck speed, it was hard to imagine that this unheard-of large language model (LLM), even one that looked impressive on paper, and was fundamentally different in many ways, could rock the boat. But that all changed overnight on January 27, 2025 – as China woke up on the day before Lunar New Year's Eve, DeepSeek had become the #1 app in the AI/GPT world and decimated the stock price of the who's who of the industry: As well as Nvidia and OpenAi, scalps included Meta, Google's parent company Alphabet, Nvidia partners Oracle, plus many other energy and data center firms. Elon Musk dodged this bullet – only because X is no longer listed on the market. While the market downturn is no doubt a temporary one, DeepSeek has permanently altered the path of the AI timeline. Until now, the US has been so far ahead in the field that all we really expected to see were poor imitations of the 'gold standard' models. And this is why DeepSeek is so interesting, because it's forged its own path, setting up China as a new player in what some are now calling a digital arms race. What makes it so different are a number of things: It's been trained on older, cheaper chips and cut out a few of the costly steps that has, until now, been the standard route for chatbots. Because of this, its development cost a reported US$5.6 million to rent the hardware required for training the model, compared with an estimated $60 million for Llama 3.1 405B, which also used 11 times the computing resources. GPT-4 cost more than $100 million. Microsoft has also said it plans to spend $80 billion on AI development in 2025. R1 is also open source, rather than closely guarded proprietary, which in turn helps DeepSeek navigate regional restrictions. Overall, this has triggered a kind of existential crisis for the US-dominated industry – because what if a model could be produced for a fraction of the cost, and trained more efficiently, and be just as good, if not better? "There are a few things to know about this one," said Casey Newton, one of the hosts of the Hard Fork podcast on January 10. "One is that it's really big; it has more than 680 billion parameters, which makes it significantly bigger than the largest model in Meta's Llama series, which I would say up to this point has been the gold standard for open models. That one has 405 billion parameters. "But the really, really important thing about DeepSeek is that it was trained at a cost of US$5.5 million," he continued. "And so what that means is you now have an LLM that is about as good as the state-of-the-art [AIs] that was trained for a tiny fraction of what something like Llama or ChatGPT was trained for." To understand why DeepSeek is so significant, you have to look at where it came from. Its developer, quantitive – or quant – trader Liang Wenfung bought up thousands of Nvidia chips back in 2021 to work on a 'side project' to assist with his day job at the helm of one of the Chinese market's largest hedge-fund companies, High-Flyer. The 40-year-old financier used these chips to build algorithms and mathematical models to help predict market trends and steer investments, with DeepSeek only established in 2023. “When we first met him, he was this very nerdy guy with a terrible hairstyle talking about building a 10,000-chip cluster to train his own models," one of Liang’s business partners told the Financial Times. "We didn’t take him seriously. He couldn’t articulate his vision other than saying: ‘I want to build this, and it will be a game changer.’ We thought this was only possible from giants like ByteDance and Alibaba.” Less than two years on, the maker of those chips – Nvidia – would see $593 billion wiped from its market value overnight thanks to Wenfung. It's now the biggest daily loss in US market history. (Incidentally, export of advanced Nvidia chips has now been restricted – yet DeepSeek-V3 was trained on cheaper, older Nvidia H800 hardware.) What makes DeepSeek's R1 model such a game-changer is its unorthodox training (and, in turn, the money saved in the process). This fantastic explainer covers a recent research paper released by the company, which essentially details how DeepSeek bypassed the traditional supervised fine-tuning stage of LLM development and instead focused on the AI's "self-evolution through a pure reinforcement learning process." “We demonstrate that reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), even without using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start," the DeepSeek researchers wrote in the January paper. "Furthermore, performance can be further enhanced with the inclusion of a small amount of cold-start data." While this is unlikely to rock the world of LLM users, who are most likely casually interacting with the likes of Google's Gemini or Anthropic's Claude, it stands as a defining moment in the development of this technology. Which brings us to another aspect of its business model that sets it apart – and has the industry rattled: Access. As Nature's Elizabeth Gibney wrote about on January 23. DeepSeek-R1 is released as "open weight," which means it can be used as a tool for researchers to study and build on. In comparison, existing market-leading models are what researchers deem a "black box," a closed-off system controlled instead by the developers. It paves the way for scientists to harness an existing model for their own uses, rather than build from the ground up. "DeepSeek hasn’t released the full cost of training R1, but it is charging people using its interface around one-30th of what [Open AI's] o1 costs to run," Gibney noted. "The firm has also created mini ‘distilled’ versions of R1 to allow researchers with limited computing power to play with the model." However, as DeepSeek triggered the market crash on January 27, it was met with cyberattackers attempting to crash its servers. "Due to large-scale malicious attacks on DeepSeek's services, we are temporarily limiting registrations to ensure continued service," the company posted on its status page. "Existing users can log in as usual. Thanks for your understanding and support." As of writing, DeepSeek-R1 can still be downloaded and the site accessed, but new registrations are restricted to China residents with a local phone number. Meanwhile, a somewhat inevitable backlash is now under way, with countless news outlets including Forbes noting that DeepSeek-R1 is hampered by censorship, stonewalling questions that would evoke criticism of China. Silicon Valley startup Perplexity AI – which currently has its sights on a US merger deal with TikTok's parent company ByteDance – was briefly hosting an "uncensored" search engine powered by DeepSeek-R1, but this too has been taken offline. Regardless of how this plays out in the coming days and weeks, one thing is certain: DeepSeek, in a few short weeks, has singlehandedly shifted the course of AI development. “The emergence of DeepSeek is a significant moment in the AI revolution," said Professor Geoff Webb, from the Department of Data Science & AI at Monash University in Australia. "Until now it has seemed that billion-dollar investments and access to the latest generation of specialized Nvidia processors were prerequisites for developing state-of-the-art systems. This effectively limited control to a small number of leading US-based tech corporations. He adds that if DeepSeek's claims are all true, "it means that the US tech sector no longer has exclusive control of the AI technologies, opening them to wider competition and reducing the prices they can charge for access to and use of their systems." Webb then makes an important point that few people are talking about: The monopolization of AI by a handful of powerful players in the US – further consolidated by government-legislated export restrictions on crucial Nvidia hardware – essentially denies the rest of the world a stake in the most significant technological advancement since the internet. “Looking beyond the implications for the stock market, current AI technologies are US-centric and embody US values and culture," he added. "This new development has the potential to create more diversity through the development of new AI systems. “It also has the potential to make AI more accessible for researchers around the world both for developing new technologies and for applying them in diverse areas including healthcare.”

Title: Analysis:US tech stock tumble highlights risk of market reliance on megacaps

Business Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., December 10, 2024. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo NEW YORK : Turbulence in some of the biggest tech names is reminding investors of one of the major risks to the U.S. stock market's record-setting rally: Reliance on a handful of mammoth companies to power those gains. Investors are scrambling to understand the fallout for the artificial intelligence (AI) investment theme that has been a critical driver for stocks over the past two years after the emergence of a low-cost Chinese AI model rattled markets. Optimism over AI has helped propel shares of chipmaker Nvidia and others of the "Magnificent Seven" megacaps, which combined contributed more than half of the S&P 500's 25 per cent total return in 2024. Because of those gains, the Magnificent Seven account for one-third of the weight of the benchmark S&P 500 and about 45 per cent of the Nasdaq 100 - meaning when they falter they have outsized impact on the closely followed market barometers. "You run the risk when you have concentration that you have selloffs like this," said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services. "It's certainly going to raise questions in terms of how investors are positioning portfolios." The S&P 500 fell 1.5 per cent on Monday after news of the DeepSeek AI model - cutting the index's year-to-date gain nearly by half - while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 sank 3 per cent. While it is uncertain "how big a threat DeepSeek itself will be to the AI theme," said Phillip Wool, chief research officer and lead portfolio manager at Rayliant Global Advisors, "it's crystal-clear that there are a bunch of correlated and crowded trades at risk when the tide of sentiment turns." Shares of Nvidia, the AI poster child whose stunning stock-price rise had propelled it to become the largest company by market value, tumbled 17 per cent on Monday. Seth Hickle, managing partner at Mindset Wealth Management, said he moved to position more defensively with Nvidia options amid the volatility following the DeepSeek news. Nvidia "is really widely held," Hickle said. "So this really affects all Americans who have a retirement portfolio or a passive equity investment strategy." Just last week President Donald Trump's announcement of private sector investment in AI infrastructure gave a lift to tech stocks and the broader market. Analysts at Capital Economics said that if it became clear that AI models could indeed be trained effectively with less high-end computing power than had previously been assumed, "there would clearly be a risk of a further correction in the U.S. stock market." "That’s because this would potentially undermine the dominant positions of some firms that have powered the rally," the Capital Economics analysts said in a note. INFLECTION POINT? Investing in broad market funds that follow the S&P 500 has been a winning bet for the past two years, with the benchmark index posting back-to-back annual gains of over 20 per cent. Many actively managed funds have been underweight the major tech stocks, which was a headwind for the funds' performance. But the increasing megacap stock concentration in the benchmarks "means that we cannot all be very passively invested as we have been over the last decade," said Shams Afzal, managing director and portfolio manager at Carnegie Investment Counsel. Some corners of tech were benefiting on Monday as investors assessed the DeepSeek implications, with shares of cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks and software company ServiceNow both up about 1 per cent. The DeepSeek news "could lead to some relative leadership shift, which could be other parts of tech, as opposed to just Nvidia," said Tiffany Wade, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. Horizon's Carlson and others wondered if Monday's AI developments could be an "inflection point" that prompts a change in market leadership or a rotation into other corners of the U.S. market that have not fared as well in recent years. To be sure, many market participants said the stock selloff could be an overreaction as investors "shoot first and ask questions later" as they sort out the DeepSeek developments. Josh Pantony, co-founder and CEO of Boosted.ai, a firm that advises asset managers on how to deploy AI, said he is adding AI-related stocks to his personal portfolio “right, left and center” in the wake of the selloff. The market will be further tested by a slew of quarterly results this week, including from Apple, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Tesla - four of the Magnificent Seven. David Wagner, head of equities and portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors LLC, said the megacap companies exhibit operating leverage, which can continue to drive operating margin expansion. "No matter how you slice it, the U.S. market is dependent on these stocks, but that's not always a bad thing," Wagner said.

Title: Asia shares are mixed after a US tech selloff as a Chinese rival joins the global AI frenzy

Yuri Kageyama Associated Press Published: January 27, 2025 at 10:50 PM Updated: January 28, 2025 at 5:31 PM Yuri Kageyama Associated Press TOKYO – Rebounding tech stocks drove U.S. indexes higher Tuesday, a day after they tumbled on doubts about whether the artificial-intelligence frenzy really needs all the dollars being poured into it. The S&P 500 climbed 0.9% to claw back more than half of its earlier drop. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 136 points, or 0.3%, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 2% after sliding 3.1 % the day before. Recommended Videos The spotlight remained on Nvidia, whose chips are powering much of the move into AI and whose stock has become a symbol of the surrounding frenzy. It rose 8.8% after plunging nearly 17% the day before, which was its worst drop since the 2020 COVID crash. Other AI-related companies also held steadier, including chip company Broadcom, which rose 2.6%. Constellation Energy picked up 1.4% after plummeting nearly 21% on Monday. It had earlier rallied on expectations it will help supply the electricity that vast AI data centers would gobble up. Such revenues are threatened after DeepSeek, a Chinese company, said it was able to develop a large language model that can perform as well as big U.S. rivals but at a fraction of the cost. That raises questions about whether all the spending expected for AI chips and electricity will need to happen. AI-related stocks have been Wall Street’s biggest stars in recent years, soaring on expectations that big spending will only continue to grow. The gains, though, also created criticism that the stock prices had simply gone too high, too fast. It’s still uncertain how much DeepSeek’s development will upend the AI industry. While it could mean less growth in spending than expected for data centers, electricity and chips, it could also boost other areas. “If AI becomes less expensive to use, we think businesses will adopt it more quickly, making a greater investment in AI software,” according to James Egelhof, chief U.S. economist at BNP Paribas. “We think this acceleration in adoption could mean a rise in software investment that offsets – or even dwarfs – any deceleration in spending on data center structures, hardware and related investment.” Outside of AI-related industries, stocks held up fairly well on Monday, and they were mixed Tuesday following a set of mixed profit reports. Royal Caribbean steamed 12% higher after the cruise operator topped analysts’ profit expectations for the end of 2024. It benefited from stronger-than-expected demand from customers booking trips closer to the time of departure. The company also gave a profit forecast for the first three months of 2025 that topped analysts’ expectations. JetBlue Airways, meanwhile, lost a quarter of its value, 25.7%, despite reporting a milder loss for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company expects its costs outside of fuel to rise more quickly at the start of 2025 than a key underlying measure of its revenue. Later this week will come profit reports from some of Wall Street’s most influential companies, including Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla. All told, the S&P 500 rose 55.42 points to 6,067.70. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 136.77 to 44,850.35, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 391.75 to 19,733.59. In the bond market, which had been driving much of Wall Street’s action before Monday’s upheaval, Treasury yields held relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury remained at 4.53%, where it was late Monday. It’s been climbing in recent months as traders pared back expectations for how many cuts the Federal Reserve will deliver to short-term interest rates this year. The U.S. economy remains solid, and worries are high that tariffs and other policies potentially coming from President Donald Trump could put upward pressure on inflation. A report showing confidence among U.S. consumers wasn’t as strong as economists expected made relatively small waves in the bond market. The more anticipated event will come on Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve will announce its latest decision on interest rates. The widespread expectation is that it will leave the federal funds rate alone. If that proves true, it would be the first meeting where the Fed did not cut rates to give the economy a boost since it began doing so in September.

Asian shares are trading mixed after Wall Street’s tech superstars tumbled as a competitor from China raised doubts over the recent artificial-intelligence market frenzy TOKYO -- Asian shares were mixed in thin Lunar New Year trading on Tuesday after Wall Street’s tech superstars tumbled as a competitor from China raised doubts over the recent artificial-intelligence market frenzy. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 lost 1.5% to 38,959.05. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was little changed, inching down 0.1% to 8,399.10. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.1% to 20,225.11. Markets in South Korea, Shanghai markets and other parts of the region were closed for holidays. Among technology companies in Japan, SoftBank Group Corp. stock extended its losses, plunging 6%. Hitachi Ltd. lost 7%, but Fujitsu and Sony Corp. recovered. Computer chip maker Tokyo Electron sank 5.5%. Fuji Media Holdings, rocked by a sex scandal, rose 1% after a marathon news conference overnight by its top executives that lasted more than 10 hours, in which two of them resigned to take responsibility for the scandal. Fuji's stock price has zigzagged in recent months amid Japanese magazine reports about “a problem” involving an anchorwoman and a Japanese male star. He has subsequently announced his retirement. On Monday, the S&P 500 dropped 1.5% to 6,012.28, dragged down in large part by a 16.9% fall for Nvidia. Other Big Tech stocks also took heavy losses, pulling the Nasdaq composite down 3.1% to 19,341.83 for its worst loss in more than a month. The damage was focused on AI-related stocks, while the rest of the market held up much better. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7% to 44,713.58, and the majority of U.S. stocks climbed. But anyone holding an S&P 500 index fund, which are found in many 401(k) accounts, felt the pain because of how influential those tech giants have become on indexes. The shock to financial markets came from China, where an AI company called DeepSeek unveiled a large language model that can compete with U.S. giants but at potentially a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek had already hit the top of the chart for free apps on Apple’s App Store by Monday morning, and analysts said such a feat was particularly impressive given how the U.S. government has restricted Chinese access to top AI chips. It's unclear, however, how much DeepSeek’s announcement will ultimately shake the economy that’s built around the AI industry, from the chip makers making semiconductors to the utilities hoping to electrify vast data centers gobbling up computing power. “It remains to be seen if DeepSeek found a way to work around these chip restrictions rules and what chips they ultimately used as there will be many skeptics around this issue given the information is coming from China,” according to Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. DeepSeek’s disruption nevertheless rocked AI-related stocks worldwide. It’s a sharp turnaround for the AI winners, which had soared in recent years on hopes that all the investment pouring in would remake the global economy and deliver gargantuan profits along the way. Such stellar performances also raised criticism that their stock prices had gone too far, too fast. Before Monday’s drop, which was its worst since the 2020 COVID crash, Nvidia’s stock had soared from less than $20 to more than $140 in less than two years, for example. A small group of seven such companies has become so dominant that they alone accounted for more than half the S&P 500’s total return last year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. They include Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. Their immense sizes give them huge sway over the S&P 500 and other indexes that give more weight to bigger companies. Markets are also awaiting earnings reports later this week from Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude added 36 cents to $73.53 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 42 cents to $77.50 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose to 155.71 Japanese yen from 154.51 yen. The euro cost $1.0441, down from $1.0493. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. NEW YORK (AP) — Rebounding tech stocks are driving U.S. indexes higher Tuesday, a day after they tumbled on doubts about whether the artificial-intelligence frenzy really needs all the dollars being poured into it. The S&P 500 was 1% higher in late trading and clawing back nearly two-thirds of its earlier drop. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 152 points, or 0.3%, with a little less than an hour remaining in trading, and the Nasdaq composite was 2% higher after sliding 3.1 % the day before. The spotlight remains on Nvidia, whose chips are powering much of the move into AI and whose stock has become a symbol of the surrounding frenzy. It rose 7.2% after plunging nearly 17% from the day before, its worst drop since the 2020 COVID crash. Other AI-related companies also held steadier, including chip company Broadcom, which rose 2.6%. Constellation Energy edged down 0.1%, but that was much milder than its plummet of 20.8% on Monday. It had earlier rallied on expectations it will help supply the electricity that vast AI data centers would gobble up. Such revenues are under threat after DeepSeek, a Chinese company, said it was able to develop a large language model that can perform as well as big U.S. rivals but at fraction of the cost. That raises questions about whether all the spending expected for AI chips and electricity will need to happen. AI-related stocks have been Wall Street’s biggest stars in recent years, soaring on expectations for big continued spending. The gains, though, also created criticism that the stock prices had simply gone too high, too fast. It's still uncertain how much DeepSeek's development will upend the AI industry. While it could mean less growth in spending for data centers, electricity and chips, it could also boost other areas. “If AI becomes less expensive to use, we think businesses will adopt it more quickly, making a greater investment in AI software," according to James Egelhof, chief U.S. economist at BNP Paribas. "We think this acceleration in adoption could mean a rise in software investment that offsets – or even dwarfs – any deceleration in spending on data center structures, hardware and related investment.” Outside of AI-related industries, stocks held up fairly well on Monday, and they were mixed Tuesday following a set of mixed profit reports. Royal Caribbean steamed 12.5% higher after the cruise operator topped analysts’ profit expectations for the end of 2024. It benefited from stronger-than-expected demand from customers booking trips closer to the time of departure. The company also gave a profit forecast for the first three months of 2025 that topped analysts’ expectations. JetBlue Airways, meanwhile, lost more than a quarter of its value, 27.3%, despite reporting a milder loss for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company said it expects its costs outside of fuel to rise more quickly at the start of 2025 than a key underlying measure of its revenue. Later this week will come profit reports from some of Wall Street’s most influential companies, including Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla. In the bond market, which had been driving much of Wall Street’s action before Monday’s upheaval, Treasury yields ticked higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged up to 4.54% from 4.53% late Monday. It’s been climbing in recent months as traders pared back expectations for how many cuts the Federal Reserve will deliver to short-term interest rates this year. The U.S. economy remains solid, and worries are high that tariffs and other policies potentially coming from President Donald Trump could put upward pressure on inflation. A report showing confidence among U.S. consumers wasn't as strong as economists expected made relatively small waves in the bond market. The more anticipated event will come on Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve will announce its latest decision on interest rates. The widespread expectation is that it will leave the federal funds rate alone. If that proves true, it would be the first meeting where the Fed did not cut rates to help the economy since it began doing so in September. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed across Europe and Asia. Japan’s Nikkei 225 lost 1.4% as SoftBank Group Corp. stock extended its losses, sinking 5.2%. Fuji Media Holdings, rocked by a sex scandal, rose 3% after a marathon news conference by its top executives that lasted more than 10 hours, in which two of them resigned to take responsibility for the scandal.

Title: New Zealand Superannuation Fund takes DeepSeek hit

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. We’re all a little poorer after Nvidia’s 17% dive on Tuesday (the stock had stabilised in early Wednesday NZT trading). The Nasdaq-listed chipmaker’s stock took a battering on fears that China’s low-cost DeepSeek AI heralds a new era of artificial intelligence (AI) that takes less computer grunt to train; essentially, fewer of Nvidia’s expensive chips. The promise is ChatGPT-level results (as long as you don’t ask it about Tiananmen Square) on a Temu budget. Software makers incorporate DeepSeek into their own apps at no cost. A ton of people have also tried DeepSeek for themselves over the past few days, pushing it to number one on Apple and Google’s app stores. It looks and feels a lot like ChatGPT, if you use that on your phone. You can also access DeepSeek via the web. “A little-known Chinese hedge fund has thrown a grenade into the world of artificial intelligence with a large language model that, in effect, matches the market leader, Sam Altman’s OpenAI, at a fraction of the cost. And while OpenAI treats its models’ workings as proprietary, DeepSeek’s R1 wears its technical innards on the outside, making it attractive for developers to use and build on,” says the Financial Times’ Lex. ”On the outside” is a reference to DeepSeek’s “open-source” model. Essentially that means software developers can access it for free and then tweak it to their own ends at low cost. The rise of the apparently much more computing-efficient DeepSeek could also lead to questions over “StarGate” – a AI infrastructure initiative co-announced by OpenAI, Oracle and Softbank in the Oval Office last week as Donald Trump looked on. The new President’s administration won’t chip in any funds toward the US$100 billion ($176b) to US$500b project, but has made loosely defined promises to clear red tape. Nvidia was coming off an epic bull run that had seen it become the single biggest equity holding in the New Zealand Superannuation Fund’s $81.6b portfolio. Many growth KiwiSaver funds have also been heavy on the stock. The AI feeding frenzy saw Nvidia’s stock gain 171% last year and kept powering upwards into early January, consolidating its position as the world’s most valuable company. But today’s rout wiped US$590b ($1.03 trillion) from Nvidia’s market value – the biggest one-day hit in Wall Street history, at least in non-inflation-adjusted dollar terms. Nvidia’s market cap fell to US$2.9t, pushing it into third place behind Apple and Microsoft. In its most recent portfolio disclosure (June 2024), the NZ Super Fund said it owned 7,856,082 Nvidia shares – which would have been worth around $2.09b on Friday and $355 million less today. The question now is whether DeepSeek has triggered the start of a months-long correction in the price of AI-related stocks and tech stocks in general – or whether the deep freakout over DeepSeek will dissipate overnight (which it seems has been the case from early Wednesday trading). The Wall Street Journal and others have noted that, so far, there’s little hard evidence of DeepSeek’s vaunted ability to be trained at ultra-low cost, using fewer chips and the geek set is arguing over whether it’s truly open source. And many are dubious that DeepSeek took just US$5.5m to develop as its makers claim, even if sanctions mean it was likely trained on cheaper, lower-grade Nvidia chips. But against that, many have seen AI stocks as being in a bubble (Nvidia is doing extremely well – its net profit increased 16% over the past quarter and 109% year-on-year to US$19.31b in the three months to October 27, 2024 – but arguably not US$3t worth of well in a world where AI faces potential energy constraints). Investors can’t spread their bets by buying into DeepSeek; it’s owned by a Chinese hedge fund called High Flyer. The NZ Super Fund – and Big Tech-heavy KiwiSaver growth funds – will be keeping a wary eye on the other members of the so-called Magnificent Seven, where the news was mixed today. Google parent Alphabet was down 4.0%. Microsoft – the major backer of ChatGPT maker OpenA – was down 2.1%. Tesla was down 2.3%. (While CEO Elon Musk has talked up the potential of AI to drive growth at the EV maker – particularly with coming robo-taxis – its recent fall away has been more tied to Trump’s executive order calling for an end to EV subsidies, or at least discussion on that point). Shares in Amazon – which has a major stake in AI firm Anthropic, maker of the Claude generative AI – were flat. Claude could take a hit from DeepSeek, but the generative AI forms a relatively small part of the tech giant’s business. Apple actually climbed 3.3%. Some analysts saw DeepSeek’s emergence as a validation of Apple’s decision to develop its own chips in-house to power its Apple Intelligence. Meta shares were also in the green. The owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp and the developer of the open-source Llama large language model was up 1.9%. Some have seen the company overspending on AI development. Its CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post on Friday his firm would spend as much as US$60b to US$65b on AI this year as it builds a massive new data centre and develops a new version of Llama. Analysts said DeepSeek illustrated that AI could be developed on a more cost-effective basis. In its most recent portfolio disclosure, the NZ Super Fund had 2,216,984 shares in Microsoft worth $1.63b; 4,512,851 shares in Apple worth $1.56b; 3,280,616 shares in Alphabet worth $984m; 2,491,984 shares in Amazon worth $790m; 640,325 shares in Meta, worth $529m; and 687084 shares in Tesla worth $223m.

Title: Nvidia calls China’s DeepSeek R1 model ‘an excellent AI advancement’: Breakthrough creates more work for the American chip maker’s graphics processing units

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/27/2025 5:44:32 PM PST by SeekAndFind Nvidia called DeepSeek’s R1 model “an excellent AI advancement,” despite the Chinese startup’s emergence causing the chip maker’s stock price to plunge 17% on Monday. “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling,” an Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC on Monday. “DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant.” The comments come after DeepSeek last week released R1, which is an open-source reasoning model that reportedly outperformed the best models from U.S. companies such as OpenAI. R1′s self-reported training cost was less than $6 million, which is a fraction of the billions that Silicon Valley companies are spending to build their artificial-intelligence models. Nvidia’s statement indicates that it sees DeepSeek’s breakthrough as creating more work for the American chip maker’s graphics processing units, or GPUs. “Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking,” the spokesperson added. “We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Nvidia also said that the GPUs that DeepSeek used were fully export compliant. That counters Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang’s comments on CNBC last week that he believed DeepSeek used Nvidia GPUs models which are banned in mainland China. DeepSeek says it used special versions of Nvidia’s GPUs intended for the Chinese market. Analysts are now asking if multi-billion dollar capital investments from companies like Microsoft , Google and Meta for Nvidia-based AI infrastructure are being wasted when the same results can be achieved more cheaply. Earlier this month, Microsoft said it is spending $80 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025 alone while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week said the social media company planned to invest between $60 to $65 billion in capital expenditures (Excerpt) Read more at cnbc.com ...

R1′s self-reported training cost was less than $6 million, which is a fraction of the billions that Silicon Valley companies are spending to build their artificial-intelligence models. Nvidia’s statement indicates that it sees DeepSeek’s breakthrough as creating more work for the American chip maker’s graphics processing units, or GPUs. “Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking,” the spokesperson added. “We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Nvidia also said that the GPUs that DeepSeek used were fully export compliant. That counters Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang’s comments on CNBC last week that he believed DeepSeek used Nvidia GPUs models which are banned in mainland China. DeepSeek says it used special versions of Nvidia’s GPUs intended for the Chinese market. Analysts are now asking if multi-billion dollar capital investments from companies like Microsoft , Google and Meta for Nvidia-based AI infrastructure are being wasted when the same results can be achieved more cheaply. Earlier this month, Microsoft said it is spending $80 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025 alone while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week said the social media company planned to invest between $60 to $65 billion in capital expenditures (Excerpt) Read more at cnbc.com ...

That counters Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang’s comments on CNBC last week that he believed DeepSeek used Nvidia GPUs models which are banned in mainland China. DeepSeek says it used special versions of Nvidia’s GPUs intended for the Chinese market. Analysts are now asking if multi-billion dollar capital investments from companies like Microsoft , Google and Meta for Nvidia-based AI infrastructure are being wasted when the same results can be achieved more cheaply. Earlier this month, Microsoft said it is spending $80 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025 alone while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week said the social media company planned to invest between $60 to $65 billion in capital expenditures (Excerpt) Read more at cnbc.com ...

The Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana - PMAY (Urban) - has made steady progress since it was announced in mid-2015. Data by Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs indicates 118.64 lakh homes have been sanctioned as of 20th January 2025. Nearly 90.22 lakh units have been completed, and nearly 112.50 lakh have been ‘grounded’. In terms of the financials, nearly INR 200,000 Cr of central assistance has already been committed. Despite fairly good progress, PMAY must be made accessible to more people, and awareness about it also needs a big shot in the arm. New adaptable, sustainable and low-cost construction technologies can be used to rapidly develop large mass housing projects. The government should also try to eliminate bottlenecks in property records. An important aspect of PMAY is interest subsidy on home loans, and direct subsidy for individual house construction or enhancement. However, to qualify for these subsidies, properties need title documents - a big hurdle, since India’s land records system is far from sophisticated enough right now to address the task holistically and at scale. Any announcements that Union Budget 2025-26 will make in context with affordable housing will doubtlessly involve PMAY. Creative solutions and strong political will can bring this vitally important programme back to centre stage, which is where it belongs. Nationally, rising prices have led to a gradual tapering down of luxury housing, and this may trigger an inflection point where the cycle can once again turn positive for the affordable segment. Any substantial announcement for the affordable housing segment in the upcoming Union Budget can strengthen the trend and give affordable housing a seriously needed leg-up. The Government is expected to walk a thin line on maintaining the fiscal deficit targets and stimulating the slowing economy with increased infrastructure investments, incentives for job creation and increasing disposable income with the middle class segment. Veloce Fintech, a part of the Lemon Group, had launched its SEBI-registered Category-II Alternative Investment Fund (AIF), the Veloce Opportunities Fund.

Veloce Fintech specializes in connecting ARCs, Real Estate Developers, MSMEs and startups with institutional lenders and investors.

Additionally, lower power supply rates would be a game-changer for the manufacturing sector, reducing production costs and boosting exports. Together, these measures could significantly strengthen India’s economic trajectory in the coming years.

Stock traded at ₹1,160.50 on the NSE, down 1.34% Indian equity benchmarks opened higher on Tuesday morning, rebounding from Monday’s sell-off, as the Reserve Bank of India’s liquidity-boosting measures lifted sentiment amid mixed global cues and ongoing concerns about US tech valuations following Chinese AI developments.

Read more We have been maintaining our bearish stance since the last 2 - 3 months and have been repeatedly advocating against catching the falling knife. Now, since we are about to enter a crucial and major support zone of 22800 - 22400, we would change our stance from bearish to cautious now. From hereon, it would be very difficult to anticipate what the Union Budget has to offer and other global developments, but unless there is any major disappointment from the budget or any other global aberration, markets are likely to see some respite in the mentioned support zone any time soon. This certainly does not mean one should start buying throttle; but yes, accumulation in a staggered manner in the coming days is advisable with no leveraged positions. On the upside, the bearish gap of 23000-23050 is likely to resist any pullbacks ahead of the event, while the formidable obstacle is present around 23350, coinciding with the 20 DEMA. As we look ahead to the week, a plethora of events is set to unfold, each holding the potential to shift market dynamics significantly. Given this landscape of potential developments, it’s essential to remain agile and responsive. The anticipated increase in volatility presents opportunities to capitalize on market movements, whether they trend upward or downward. Staying alert and adaptable will be crucial for navigating the twists and turns that lie ahead. It could possibly be hasty to build in rate cut expectations in the February review as the broader growth inflation mix does not unambiguously call for the same. Having said that, this remains a close call and would clearly involve a subjective call with respect to the timing. Given that liquidity actions have a far direct and sustained impact, which has clearly been done, there is clearly merit in pushing back rate cuts possibly until there is more clarity on the external front as well as evolution of domestic growth inflation mix as well as liquidity conditions over the coming quarters. The April review possibly remains a better bet for the same. In the near term, the union budget should set the tone both for any potential fiscal actions to address consumption demand in the economy and to revive private sector investments.

ENERGY International crude oil prices tumbled on Monday amid concern that weakness in China’s economy will keep its energy demand depressed. Also, Monday’s stock rout sparked a risk-off sentiment in asset markets. Losses in crude were contained as the dollar index fell to a 5-week low. International crude prices have started marginally higher this early Tuesday morning in Asian trading ahead of the outcome of the Fed meeting. NYMEX WTI March range for the day is between $70.65 to $76.20, while the MCX February crude futures could trade within the range of 6,110 to 6,560. On the options side, highest Call OI is at 6500 strike, while the highest Put OI is at 6000 strike for 17 February 2025 expiry. NYMEX and domestic natural gas tumbled on Monday to a 2-week low and closed sharply lower on the outlook for warmer US temperatures early next month. The Commodity Weather Group said that forecasts moved warmer for the central part of the US for February 1 to 5 and could reduce demand for gas. NYMEX Gas prices have started flat this early Tuesday morning in Asian trading. NYMEX Gas March range for the day is between $3.080 to $3.420, while the MCX February NG futures could trade within the range of 268 to 294. On the options side, highest Call OI is at 320 strike, while the highest Put OI is at 260 strike for 21 February 2025 expiry. BASE METALS LME and domestic MCX copper tumbled on Monday as market sentiment was dampened by US President Donald Trump’s threat to impose tariffs and sanctions on Colombia. The Dollar Index and the U.S. Treasury Yields extended losses and capped downside on Monday’s session. On the data front, it was overall positive for the Dollar and weighed on gold and silver. Other metals ended weaker on LME and MCX on Monday’s trade. From an intraday perspective, international copper has started mixed this early Tuesday morning in Asian trading as there is broader risk-off sentiment across base metals. The Dollar Index and bond yields gained this Tuesday morning ahead of Fed. Although, the beginning of the Chinese New Year holiday today will keep volumes low. Intraday, the range for LME copper is between $8,940 to $9,320, while that for MCX February copper is between 814 to 846. On the MCX Copper options side, highest Call OI is at 840 strike, while the highest Put OI is at 840 strike for 21 February 2025 expiry. Most other metals on LME have started weaker this early Monday morning in Asian trading. Domestically, the range for MCX aluminium February is 245 to 253, while that for MCX zinc February is 266 to 273 and that for MCX lead February is 178 to 181 Currency The Indian Rupee opened weaker against the Dollar on Tuesday tracking a decline in most of its regional peers amid dampened risk appetite. A recovery in the Dollar Index and Treasury Yields this Tuesday morning could also weigh on the Rupee. Although, a drop in the crude oil prices and possibly a small recovery on the domestic equity markets could cap losses for the Rupee. In the overseas markets, the U.S. Dollar Index and the U.S. Treasury Yields eased on Monday. The Dollar Index and the U.S. Treasury Yields has started with gains this early Tuesday morning in Asian trading ahead of the Fed meeting outcome this week. Key triggers today will be Durable goods orders. The Euro ended marginally higher on Monday but started weaker against the Dollar this Tuesday morning trade in Asia amid forecasts of a rate cut from the ECB this week. The Pound/Sterling gained against the Dollar this Monday but started weaker against the Dollar this Tuesday morning trade in Asia, tracking a recovery of the greenback. The Japanese Yen appreciated against the Dollar on Monday on BoJ rate hike revisions, although the Yen started weaker further this Tuesday morning as the dollar rebounded following fresh tariff threats from US President Donald Trump. US benchmarks showed a mix of performances, with both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 registering losses, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) remained positive. The decline in the Nasdaq and S&P 500 was mainly due to the significant drop in tech stocks, particularly Nvidia, after the introduction of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI assistant that’s much cheaper than its US counterparts, affecting the AI landscape dynamics. Over in Asia, the Nikkei fell as the US tech stock turmoil spread to Japan, and the strengthening yen further dampened market sentiment. Meanwhile, the Hang Seng index stayed nearly flat after starting the day strong. Domestically, markets are expected to open on a positive note, but global sentiments might influence the benchmarks as the day goes on. The IT sector is predicted to remain under pressure due to the developments around DeepSeek and the general weakness in global tech sentiment. The benchmark index started the trading week with continued selling pressure from the prior session, opening 152 points lower and breaching the critical support level around 22976. This set a bearish tone for the day, culminating in a close within the lower quartile of the trading range—marking a panic day as it finished 263 points down from the previous close. This situation has resulted in significantly oversold market conditions, suggesting that the near-term incentive for additional short positions is relatively low, which is a positive development. The area around 22800 now serves as a vital support level, and maintaining a position above it will be essential to garner bullish strength. Yesterday’s trading session saw bearish sentiment dominate Dalal Street, with Nifty closing well below the 23,000 mark. Pessimism persists due to global headwinds, including uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s tariff plans and significant outflows from Foreign Institutional Investors, amounting to Rs. 74,096 crore in January. Wall Street also reacted negatively to reports of Chinese startup DeepSeek’s cost-efficient AI model, posing a challenge to major U.S. tech giants. Key upcoming catalysts include the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting on January 28-29 and the Union Budget 2025 on February 1st. Stocks in focus include Bajaj Auto, Hindustan Zinc, Hyundai Motors, Cipla, TVS Motors, and Coal India, which reported a 17% decline in Q3 net profit to Rs. 8,505.57 crore. Sell Balkrishna Industries (CMP 2565) in the 2590-2610 zone with a stop at 2727 for targets of 2489/2419. Also, bearish positions are recommended for Jindal Steel & Power, Divis Lab, and Balkrishna Industries on any early intraday strength. From a technical perspective, the market is consistently facing selling pressure at higher levels and is forming lower tops on daily charts, which is negative. Technically, the levels of 23,000 and 23,050 would serve as key resistance areas, while 22800 and 22,750 could act as important support zones. If it falls below 22,750, selling pressure may intensify that could send market to 22600 levels. The strategy should be to reduce weak long positions around 23000-23050 levels, however, during the week if it falls to 22600 then we should look for buying select stocks with a medium to long-term view. Regarding Bank Nifty, as long as it remains below 49000, weak sentiment will likely persist. On the downside, it could decline to the 47,500-47,200 range. However, if it rises above 49,000, there could be a rebound to the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) or up to 49,500. “The DeepSeek impact on the US stock market in general, and the tech stocks in particular, has turned out to be a reality check for the overvalued stock market. In the medium-term this is likely to have a sobering effect on markets, globally. The Indian market appears to be oversold and is set for a rebound. The RBI’s announcement of measures to boost the liquidity in the banking system by around Rs 1.5 trillion is positive for the market. This raises the prospects of a rate cut by the MPC in the February policy meeting. Banks are likely to benefit. After the correction the market is now trading at fair valuations which are in line with long-term (10-year) averages. Investors can utilise the opportunity to buy fundamentally strong high quality stocks. The outperformance of largecaps over mid-and smallcaps is a healthy trend.” 360 ONE’s operating revenue grew 38% YoY and was 7% higher than our estimates, driven by 14% beat in transactional income. Additionally, strong beat in other income resulted in 17% beat in PAT at Rs 270 crore (+42% YoY). 360 ONE’s Board has proposed the acquisition of one of India’s leading brokerage and corporate advisory houses – B&K Securities. The proposed acquisition of B&K will add a new research capability across all platforms of 360 ONE and also provide entry into the IB segment. Since the cost structure of B&K is aligned with 360 ONE, the acquisition will be EPS accretive. We reiterate our BUY rating with a one-year target price of Rs 1,350 Investing in AI may be nothing like as expensive as previously thought. This should accelerate the advancement of the technology. But at the same time it also means that chief financial officers will start to ask questions about the enormous amounts being spent on computing power in the AI arms race. GREED & fear has been concerned that the stock market would at some point this year question all this spending in the continuing absence of clear proof of monetisation. This was, first and foremost, a potential threat to the share prices of the hyperscalers who have been spending the money. But the DeepSeek news will now cause pressure on the AI hardware supply chain on concerns that the likes of Meta will do a U-turn and slash capex spending. The other issue raised by the DeepSeek news is that, while it is clearer than ever that the age of AI is coming, it is also increasingly equally clear that the long fashionable concepts of “moats”, as applied by fund managers to individual companies in the investment world, looks ever more precarious, if not redundant, in the AI world given the monumental scope for disruption. This is highly relevant given the massive market capitalisations represented by Big Tech at a time when these companies have in practice been converging on the same AI area to compete with each other. It seems unlikely in the extreme to GREED & fear that all the current dominant incumbents will prevail in the new world order which emerges. :Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty 50 are likely to open gap up as trend in GIFT Nifty suggest a positive start for the broader index. Asian markets were trading mixed. Nasdaq posted its biggest one-day percentage drop since December18 on Monday as a low-cost Chinese artificial intelligence model prompted a steep selloff in U.S. chipmakers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 289.33 points, or 0.65%, to 44,713.58, the S&P 500 lost 88.96 points, or 1.46%, to 6,012.28 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 612.47 points, or 3.07%, to 19,341.83. Spot gold is likely to slip towards $2720 level on strong dollar and rise in US treasury yields. Further, investors will remain cautious ahead of US Federal Reserve monetary policy where central bank is likely to keep its policy unchanged, while all eyes will be on comments to get clarity on future rate path. Additionally, market will try to decode how US President Donald Trump’s policies will impact Fed’s views on growth and inflation. Moreover, expectation of improved economic data from US will hurt prices HDFC Securities has a ‘reduce’ on Indian Oil Corporation with a target price of Rs 124, on margin pressure due to increasing petchem supplies/capacity, lower refining margins, and moderation in auto fuel marketing margins. The oil refiner’s Q3 earnings were affected by weak performance from petchem segment, lower refining margins, inventory loss and absorption of under-recovery on LPG. HDFC Sec said gross refining margin came in lower than estimates at $2.9/bbl, while gross debt rose 24% on year to Rs 1.3 lakh crore. DCB Bank over the last 4-5 quarters consistently grew its loan book and deposits at ~20% on a YoY basis. During the quarter, the Bank reported a strong loan book growth of 23%/7% on a YoY/QoQ basis, with the mortgage/AIB segment contributing 45%/24% of the loan book, demonstrating a growth of 6%/3% on a QoQ and 21% each on a YoY basis. Co-lending has played a significant role in the current quarter, contributing to the surge in loan growth from 18-19% to 23% on a YoY basis. NII grew by 15%/7% on a YoY/QoQ basis. NIM was stable on a QoQ basis at ~3.3%. During the quarter, the Bank’s core fee income increased by 49%/2% on a YoY/QoQ basis and costto-income ratio witnessed an improvement of 191/156 bps on a YoY/QoQ basis which led to a PPOP growth of 28%/6% on a YoY/QoQ basis. The Bank is showcasing continuous decline of slippages while the stress on MFI portfolio remained challenging, resulting in higher provisions by 64%/47% on a YoY/QoQ basis. Going forward, management aims to improve NIM, reduce cost-to-income ratio, and achieve an ROA of >1% in FY26. Lower e-auction price as well as minimal volume growth dented revenue, while EBITDA fell 13% YoY to Rs 10400 crore and EBITDA per ton fell to Rs 535 down by Rs 89/ton. Nuvama said it was trimming the coal miner’s FY25 and FY26 EBITDA by 3% and 5% respectively to factor i the lower volume. The stock was more of a dividend play, it said, adding, “We do not see much downside, but prefer to wait for volume growth to re-enter the stock.” Bank Nifty witnessed some outperformance led by index pivotal compared to the broader markets sell off across sectors and stocks to decline by 0.6% for the day. The 100-week average would be at 47,100 levels which is at support while on the higher side resistance would be at 49,200 levels. RSI is trending below the average line, and other key technical indicators are oversold form current levels so a minor pullback cannot be ruled out from current levels. Highest call OI has moved lower to 50,000 strikes while the downside the highest put OI has moved lower to 47,500 for the monthly expiry NIFTY-50 has closed at 7-month lows and now the support would move lower to the monthly pivot of 22,600 from current levels. We expect some sharp volatility in the second half on back of the monthly expiry in the Sensex and Bankex as well as roll over movement in individual sectors and stocks. RSI is oversold on hourly charts and expect some rebound from the lower range to test the average line from current levels. Highest call OI has moved lower to 23,200 strikes while the downside the highest put is at 22,500 for the monthly expiry. Coal India’s 3QFY25 witnessed a decent improvement following the drag seen in 2QFY25 (which was affected by extended monsoon). The e-auction volumes also remained elevated with some increase in e-auction premiums, which supported profitability. - For FY26/FY27, we maintain our estimates and expect volumes to improve, which would boost earnings performance. The e-auction premium is expected to remain stable ahead. - The company’s focus on increasing coal-washer capacity will improve its market share in domestic coking/non-coking coal. Further, management is focusing on coalmine expansions, which would be funded via internal accruals, or COAL might borrow to undertake certain strategic diversification projects, such as RE facilities and coal gasification, et al. - At CMP, the stock is trading at 3.3x FY27E EV/EBITDA. We reiterate our BUY rating with a TP of INR480 (premised on 4.5x on FY27 EV/EBITDA). - COAL remains our top pick in the metals and mining sector Wall Street tumbled on Monday on threat to US tech companies from DeepSeek, an AI competitor in China. Big Tech stocks took the heaviest losses, with Nvidia down 17%, dragging the Nasdaq composite down 3% ACC’s third quarter was characterised by strong volume growth but weak unitary EBITDA, said Nomura, pointing out the duty refund masked a disappointing quarter. Adjusting for this, the EBITDA of Rs 144/ton was down 4 per cent sequentially, making ACC the only major cement producer to report a quarterly decline. Cement volumes grew 20% YoY to 10.7 million ton, above estimates. “We expect higher share of MSA (master supply agreement) volumes. This could also include some portion of Penna (unlisted) or Sanghi volumes,” said the brokerage firm. It said it maintained its ‘reduce’ recommendation and target price of Rs 1920 based on 10x one-year forward EV/EBITDA The short-term outlook is bullish for the Bank of India. The stock began the week on a positive note, surging 6 per cent on Monday. A complex inverted head and shoulder pattern is visible on the daily chart. The neckline support of this pattern is at ₹101. Below this, the broad ₹100-₹97 region is the next strong support.

Full Content:
Bengaluru - DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up that is just over a year old, has stirred awe and consternation in Silicon Valley after demonstrating breakthrough artificial intelligence (AI) models that offer comparable performance to the worldâs best chatbots at seemingly a fraction of the cost. DeepSeekâs emergence may offer a counterpoint to the belief that the future of AI will require ever-increasing amounts of power and energy to develop. Global technology stocks tumbled as hype around DeepSeekâs innovation snowballed and investors began to digest the implications for its US-based rivals and hardware suppliers. DeepSeek was founded in 2023 by Mr Liang Wenfeng, the chief of AI-driven quant hedge fund High-Flyer. The company develops AI models that are open source, meaning the developer community at large can inspect and improve the software. Its mobile app surged to the top of iPhone download charts in the US after its release in early January.Â The app distinguishes itself from other chatbots like OpenAIâs ChatGPT by articulating its reasoning before delivering a response to a prompt. The company claims its new AI model, R1, offers performance on a par with OpenAIâs latest and has granted licence for individuals interested in developing chatbots using the technology to build on it.Â Though not fully detailed by the company, the cost of training and developing DeepSeekâs models appears to be only a fraction of what is required for OpenAI or Meta Platformsâ best products. The modelâs much-better efficiency puts into question the need for vast expenditures of capital to acquire the latest and most powerful AI accelerators from the likes of Nvidia. That amplifies attention on US export curbs of such advanced semiconductors to China, which were intended to prevent a breakthrough of the sort that DeepSeek appears to represent. DeepSeek says R1 is near or better than rival models in several leading benchmarks such as AIME 2024 for mathematical tasks: MMLU for general knowledge and AlpacaEval 2.0 for question-and-answer performance. It ranks among the top performers on a UC Berkeley-affiliated leaderboard called Chatbot Arena. Washington has banned the export of high-end technologies like GPU semiconductors to China, in a bid to stall the countryâs advances in AI, the key frontier in the US-China contest for tech supremacy. But DeepSeekâs progress suggests Chinese AI engineers have worked their way around the restrictions, focusing on greater efficiency with limited resources. While it is unclear how much advanced AI-training hardware DeepSeek has had access to, the company has showed enough to suggest the trade restrictions have not been entirely effective in stymieing the countryâs progress. The AI developer has been closely watched since the release of its earliest model in 2023. It gave the world a glimpse of its DeepSeek R1 model, designed to mimic human thinking. That model underpins its mobile chatbot app, which together with the web interface in January became known as a much cheaper OpenAI alternative, with investor Marc Andreessen calling it âAIâs Sputnik momentâ. OpenAI chief executive officer Sam Altman said on X: âDeepSeekâs R1 is an impressive model, particularly around what theyâre able to deliver for the price.â The DeepSeek mobile app was downloaded 1.6 million times by Jan 25 and ranked No. 1 in iPhone app stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the US and Britain, according to market tracker App Figures. Born in Guangdong in 1985, Mr Liang received bachelorâs and mastersâ degrees in electronic and information engineering from Zhejiang University. He founded DeepSeek in 2023 with 10 million yuan (S$1.9 million) in registered capital, according to company database Tianyancha. The bottleneck for further advances is not more fund-raising, he told Chinese media outlet 36kr, but US restrictions on access to the best chips. Most of his top researchers were fresh graduates from top Chinese universities, he said, stressing the need for China to develop its own domestic ecosystem.Â âMore investment does not necessarily lead to more innovation. Otherwise, large companies would take over all innovation,â Mr Liang said. Chinaâs technology leaders, from Alibaba Group Holding and Baidu to Tencent Holdings, have poured significant money and resources into the race to acquire hardware and customers for their AI ventures. Alongside chief executive Kai-Fu Leeâs 01.AI start-up, DeepSeek stands out with its open-source approach â which is designed to recruit the largest number of users quickly before developing monetisation strategies. Because DeepSeekâs models are more affordable, it has played a role in helping to drive down costs for AI developers in China, where the bigger players have engaged in a price war that has seen successive waves of price cuts over the past 1Â½ years. DeepSeekâs success may push OpenAI and US providers to lower pricing to maintain their established lead. It calls into question the vast spending by companies like Meta and Microsoft â each of which has committed to capital expenditure of US$65 billion (S$87.7 billion) or more this year, largely on AI infrastructure â if more efficient models can also compete with a much smaller outlay.Â That roiled global stock markets as investors sold off companies like Nvidia and ASML Holding that have benefited from booming demand for AI services. Shares in Chinese names linked to DeepSeek, such as Iflytek, climbed. Developers around the world are already experimenting with DeepSeekâs software to build tools with it. That could quicken the adoption of advanced AI reasoning models â while potentially touching off additional concern about the need for guardrails around their use. DeepSeekâs advances may hasten regulation to control how AI is developed.Â Like all other Chinese AI models, DeepSeek self-censors on topics deemed sensitive in China. It deflects queries about the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests or geopolitically fraught questions such as the possibility of China invading Taiwan. In tests, the DeepSeek bot is capable of giving detailed responses about political figures like Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but declines to do so about Chinese President Xi Jinping. DeepSeekâs cloud infrastructure is likely to be tested by its sudden popularity. It also briefly experienced a major outage on Jan 27 and will have to manage even more traffic as new and returning users pour more queries into its chatbot.Â BLOOMBERG JoinÂ ST's Telegram channelÂ and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Title: Nvidia sheds $792 billion of market value in DeepSeek rout, biggest one-day loss in US history

NEW YORK - Nvidiaâs share plunge, fuelled by investor concern about Chinese artificial-intelligence (AI) start-up DeepSeek, erased a record amount of stock-market value from the worldâs largest company.Â Nvidiaâs shares tumbled 17 per cent on Jan 27, erasing US$589 billion (S$792 billion) from the companyâs market capitalisation. That eclipsed the previous record â a 9 per cent drop in September that wiped out about US$279 billion in value â and was the biggest in US stock-market history. The drop rippled through the rest of the market due to how much weight Nvidia has in major indexes. Including Jan 27âs slump, Nvidia sell-offs have caused eight of the top 10 biggest one-day drops in the S&P 500 Index, based on market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&P 500 fell 1.5 per cent on Jan 27 and the Nasdaq 100 tumbled nearly 3 per cent. The semiconductor maker led a broader sell-off in technology stocks after DeepSeekâs low-cost approach reignited concerns that big US companies have poured too much money into developing AI. The Chinese firm appears to provide a comparable performance at a fraction of the price.Â The latest AI model of DeepSeek, released last week, is widely seen as competitive with those of ChatGPTâs OpenAI and Facebookâs Meta Platforms. The open-sourced product was founded by quant-fund chief Liang Wenfeng and is now at the top of Appleâs App Store rankings. Â âConcerns have immediately emerged that it could be a disruptor to the current AI business model, which relies on high end chips and extensive computing power and hence energy,â Jefferies analysts said in a note to clients. Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the influx in spending on AI because it designs semiconductors used in the technology. While that heavy spending looks poised to continue, investors may grow wary of rewarding companies that are not showing a sufficient return on the investment. Meta announced plans on Jan 24 to boost capital expenditures on AI projects this year by about half to as much as US$65 billion, sending its shares to a record high. That came on the heels of OpenAI, SoftBank Group and Oracle announcing a US$100 billion joint venture called Stargate to build out data centres and AI infrastructure projects around the United States. In a bid to stall Chinaâs progress in AI, the US has banned the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to the country and is limiting sales of advanced Nvidia AI chips to others. But DeepSeekâs progress suggests Chinese AI engineers have found a way to work around the export bans, focusing on greater efficiency with limited resources. Nvidia said in a statement on Jan 27 that DeepSeekâs model is an âexcellent AI advancementâ and indicated that the Chinese company did not violate US restrictions that limit access to advanced US chips in creating its technology. It also added that inference, or the work of running AI models, ârequires significant numbers of Nvidia GPUs and high-performance networkingâ.

Title: Deepseek Announcement Sinks The American Tech Market

Horizontal color image of a data center from a drone point of view. Amid a free-ranging route of U.S. tech stocks, investors are wondering how the new announcement from Chinese firm DeepSeek, of a new efficient reasoning model to be reckoned with, is going to affect the industry long-term. It’s not just investors, either – the big question for many people looking at the global race for AI is whether DeepSeek’s result really will deliver a great reasoning model for a lot lower cost than its American competitors. In the past few cycles, the world saw double-digit losses for Nvidia, and other negative action, like Palantir dipping 6%, that’s making the bulls nervous. We’ve even seen other kinds of U.S. stocks like nuclear stocks tanking on the premise that America might be spending less on dominating AI and data center markets in the future. "DeepSeek has taken the market by storm by doing more with less," said Giuseppe Sette, president at AI market research firm Reflexivity, as reported by Aimee Picchi at CBS News. "This shows that with AI the surprises will keep on coming in the next few years." But it’s worth thinking a little more long-term about this, since we’re likely to have a pretty big global market for AI in the years to come. People are referring to the DeepSeek announcement as America’s “Sputnik moment” for the AI age, when U.S. parties had a right to be spooked. However, others are asking whether the proof is in the pudding, and whether DeepSeek really does have an advanced edge over the American systems. A team of writers at Bloomberg reported: “(Some) investors, like Fares Hendi at French asset manager Prevoir AM, say they’re holding onto their Nvidia shares and waiting for more information about DeepSeek’s technological promise.” “If they really need less chips to make their model run, then yes the threat is real, it would weigh on growth and valuation,” Hendi said, as reported in Bloomberg. “But at the moment, we’re going to take the time to really look into it.” Then, too, some who were quoted suggested the news might be good for AI, in the long-term and from a big-picture perspective: “It would seem to me that if you still believe that AI is going to be big, this news out of China should only make you feel better… and perhaps present you with some buying opportunities,” said Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert. “To be clear, that doesn’t mean that there won’t be bumps or risks (as price seeking continues). But it should be clear that there are some stocks that will be down this morning for the wrong reasons.” Financial pros weighed in on the phenomenon, too. “It’s safe to say that anything US-AI related was very crowded and anything tech-related in China was very under owned,” explains Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group. “So you are going to see a bit of a unwind of those two different crowded sides. It’ll be interesting to see if the options market picks some winners and losers.” Over the past few years, we’ve seen OpenAI and Anthropic and others continue to develop advanced reasoning systems in a way that suggested America was going to be king of the AI world for the duration. But people close to the industry knew that China had its own research teams and systems that were likely to give other nations a run for their money. Time will tell how much fire power DeepSeek has and whether it will continue to depress the American technology sector in the stock market. Another argument emerges that China and the U.S. can both reign supreme in their own hemispheres, in terms of AI systems. Some of the above quotes hint at that, too. Of course, there’s always going to be one particular model that’s better than any others, but there’s also room for customization and specialization in these systems. It’s one thing to concede that stocks like Nvidia, which had wildly spiraled up based on U.S. dominance predictions, is going to keep its high valuation, but it’s another thing to wonder whether China will have an outside influence on American AI systems. Like anything related to the lightning-speed transformation of LLMs in business, the U.S./China divide is going to take some time to figure out. When the dust clears, what will we see? One Community.

Title: OpenAI's Sam Altman, who once warned America about Trump, is now partnering with him

Time Published: 2025-01-27T21:34:09Z
Full Content:
"Trump represents an unprecedented threat to America," Altman wrote in 2016. The day after President Donald Trump returned to office, Sam Altman, the CEO of tech giant OpenAI, stood behind the presidential seal at the White House and praised the newly sworn-in president for the $500 billion "Stargate" initiative he was joining to build an artificial intelligence infrastructure in the United States. Altman said it wouldn't have been possible without Trump. "For AGI [artificial general intelligence] to get built here, to create hundreds of thousands of jobs, to create a new industry centered here, we wouldn't be able to do this without you, Mr. President, and I'm thrilled that we get to," Altman said as he and other industry leaders smiled for photos in the Roosevelt Room. The chummy announcement represented a stark reversal for Altman, who -- in the early days of Trump's first term -- emerged as one of Silicon Valley's first and most vocal critics of the president. From 2016 through 2022, Altman repeatedly warned about what he saw as the dangers posed by Trump's leadership and his policies. During the 2016 campaign, he compared Trump to Hitler in 1930s Germany, and he called on other tech companies to stand against Trump in the early days of the new administration. He donated hundreds of thousands to Democratic causes and candidates, including $200,000 to help reelect President Joe Biden in 2024. After Trump announced the "Stargate" deal, the OpenAI CEO appeared to address his reversal in a post on X, writing that "watching [Trump] more carefully recently has really changed my perspective on him," and adding, "I'm not going to agree with him on everything, but I think he will be incredible for the country in many ways!" Other tech leaders have shifted their stance on Trump in recent years, even more so since his 2024 election win. Earlier this month, Mark Zuckerberg's Meta announced the end of its fact-checking program and eased restrictions on discussions about topics such as immigration and gender identity, following longstanding criticism from President Trump and his allies. Altman's public opposition to Trump began during the 2016 presidential campaign when, in October of that year, Altman made his first-ever presidential endorsement by backing Hillary Clinton. "I am endorsing Hillary Clinton for president. I've never endorsed a presidential candidate before, but I'm making an exception this year, because this election is exceptional," Altman wrote in a blog post on Oct. 16, 2016, titled "The 2016 Election." "Donald Trump represents an unprecedented threat to America, and voting for Hillary is the best way to defend our country against it," Altman wrote. Months earlier, in the heat of the presidential campaign, Altman had published a scathing critique of Trump, writing, "He is irresponsible in the way dictators are." "To anyone familiar with the history of Germany in the 1930s, it's chilling to watch Trump in action," Altman wrote in June 2016. "Though I know intellectually it's easy in hard economic times to rile people up with a hatred of outsiders, it's still surprising to watch this happen right in front of us." "Hitler taught us about the Big Lie -- the lie so big, and so often repeated, that people end up believing it," Altman wrote. "Trump's Big Lie is hiding in plain sight. His Big Lie is that he's going to Make America Great by keeping us safe from outsiders." After Trump's victory, Altman called on his fellow tech leaders to "take a stand" against the new Trump administration in the wake of Trump's executive order known as the so-called Muslim ban, which Trump called "a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States." Altman called the 2017 order "a breach of America's contract with all the immigrants in the nation." The order spurred nationwide protests and legal challenges before being modified and then overturned by President Biden in 2021. He urged the tech industry to take action, writing on his personal blog, "The tech community is powerful. Large tech companies in particular have enormous power and are held in high regard. We need to hear from the CEOs clearly and unequivocally." He added that employees at tech companies "should push their companies to figure out what actions they can take." "It would be particularly embarrassing for us to fall for this -- we are a nation of immigrants, and we know that immigrants built this country (and Trump, of course, is the grandson of immigrants and married to an immigrant)," Altman wrote. Altman himself took action by launching a website called "Track Trump," which monitored Trump's fulfillment of his 2016 campaign promises over his first 100 days in office. He shared the website in a February 2017 tweet in which he said, "For all the noise, Trump hasn't actually done very much yet." Altman's public criticism continued throughout Trump's first presidency. In a March 2017 tweet, Altman posted, "I think Trump is terrible and few things would make me happier than him not being president." "If you elect a reality TV star as President, you can't be surprised when you get a reality TV show," Altman wrote in July 2017. At a "Talks with Google" event in October 2017, Altman defended his outspoken criticism of Trump. Acknowledging that "if you "piss off the president, he might do bad things to you," Altman nevertheless said that "when the future of the republic is at risk, the duty to the country and our values transcends the duty to your particular company and your stock price." "I think I started that a little bit earlier than other people, but at this point I am in really good company," Altman added. Later, in the wake of Trump's 2020 election loss, Altman praised LinkedIn chairman and Democratic supporter Reid Hoffman, writing on Twitter, "Very few people realize just how much @reidhoffman did and spent to stop Trump from getting re-elected -- it seems reasonably likely to me that Trump would still be in office without his efforts. Thank you, Reid!" In recent years, Altman has himself contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates and causes, including giving $200,000 in 2023 to the Biden Victory Fund, the joint fundraising committee that sought to reelect Joe Biden in 2024, according to federal election commission records reviewed by ABC News. Early in the 2020 election cycle, he contributed to a slew of Democratic primary presidential contenders, including to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, then-Sen. Kamala Harris and Andrew Yang, then later gave $100,000 to the Biden Victory Fund in the final weeks of the 2020 campaign. He also gave $100,000 each to the pro-Democratic super PACs American Bridge PAC and Senate Majority PAC. He wasn't an active political contributor during the 2016 election cycle, but gave a total of $1,500 to the Obama campaign in 2008 and 2012. Although Altman has almost exclusively donated to Democrats, he has also donated to a handful of Republicans, including California Reps. Darrell Issa and Jay Obernolte, Rep. John Curtis of Utah, and Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. Then, after Trump was reelected this past November, Altman was among the first corporate executives to publicly announce their donation to the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee, as tech companies including Meta and Amazon lined up to financially support Trump's inauguration. An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed to ABC News that Altman donated $1 million to the inaugural committee in December. Last Monday, Altman was among the select number of tech executives spotted attending Trump's swearing-in ceremony inside the Capitol rotunda. "President Trump will lead our country into the age of AI, and I am eager to support his efforts to ensure America stays ahead," Altman wrote in a statement to ABC News at the time about his inauguration contribution. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

The emergence of the Chinese AI model spurred a Wall Street selloff of some of the biggest names in tech on Monday DeepSeek, the hottest name in artificial intelligence, took a Chinese hammer to several tech companies on Monday, with Microsoft, Google and especially Nvidia seeing their stock prices take a noticeable hit. If you missed it, DeepSeek climbed to the top of Apple’s App Store this weekend — surpassing OpenAI’s ChatGPT — after releasing its R1 and R1-Zero models. DeepSeek, founded by Chinese entrepreneur Liang Wenfeng, quickly shook up the tech world — which you can read more about by clicking here — and spurred a Wall Street sell-off for several AI-focused companies, such as: — Microsoft, OpenAI’s chief partner, dropped 2.14% — Alphabet, Google’s parent company that has its own AI model, Gemini, dropped 4% — Tesla, which uses AI for its FSD (full self-driving) technology, declined 2.32% — Nvidia, which makes GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) and chips that are the backbone of many AI applications, saw its stock price crater 16.86%. The Santa Clara-based company was the world’s most valuable company last Thursday, but has since dipped to third place, behind Apple and Microsoft, with a $2.9 trillion market cap when market’s closed on Monday. Notably, Meta — the parent company of Facebook and Instagram — avoided the dip; Meta’s stock price increased 2.2% on Monday. Like DeepSeek — and unlike ChatGPT and Gemini — the company’s Llama AI model is open-source. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also announced last Friday the company would be spending $60 billion-$65 billion this year to enhance its AI efforts. The sell-off is likely due to fears that China has caught, or even surpassed, America in the AI arms race (remember, China’s communist government is closely tied to every one of the country’s tech companies, including ByteDance, TikTok’s parent). On Monday, the S&P 500 dropped 1.46% and the Nasdaq 3.07%. Marc Andreessen, co-founder of the tech-focused Andreessen Horowitz venture capital firm, even called DeepSeek AI’s “sputnik moment” on Sunday. However, Wedbush managing director Dan Ives, during an interview with CNBC on Monday afternoon, said he does not view DeepSeek’s emergence as a death sentence for the established American players in AI. “In my view, it’s a top three buying opportunity that I’ve seen in the last decade for tech,” Ives said. “I think the Street and the market got this way wrong. In no way does this dent our bull thesis.”

Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek has rocked the US stock market after demonstrating breakthrough artificial intelligence models that offer comparable performance to the world’s best chatbots at seemingly a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek is only a year old but it’s quickly become the No.1 app in the Australian app store, and its emergence may offer a counterpoint to the widespread belief that the future of AI will require ever-increasing amounts of power and energy to develop. Global technology stocks tumbled overnight as hype around DeepSeek’s innovation snowballed and investors began to digest the implications for its US-based rivals and their hardware suppliers. The app distinguishes itself from other chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT by articulating its reasoning before delivering a response.Credit: Bloomberg Shares in AI giant Nvidia tanked 17 per cent and the company lost a record $US589 billion ($936 billion) in market capitalisation; the net worth of its CEO and largest shareholder Jensen Huang fell by some $US20 billion in mere hours. Shares in Oracle also plummeted. DeepSeek was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, chief of AI-driven quant hedge fund High-Flyer. The company develops open-source AI models, meaning the developer community at large can inspect and improve the software. Its mobile app surged to the top of the iPhone download charts in the US after its release in early January. The app distinguishes itself from other chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT by articulating its reasoning before delivering a response to a prompt. The company claims its R1 release offers performance on par with OpenAI’s latest and has granted the licence for individuals interested in developing chatbots using the technology to build on it. Though not fully detailed by the company, the cost of training and developing DeepSeek’s models appears to be only a fraction of what’s required for OpenAI or Meta’s best products. The much better efficiency of the model puts into question the need for vast expenditures of capital to acquire the latest and most powerful AI accelerators from the likes of Nvidia. That also amplifies attention on US export curbs of such advanced semiconductors to China – which were intended to prevent a breakthrough of the sort that DeepSeek appears to represent. DeepSeek says R1 is near or better than rival models in several leading benchmarks such as AIME 2024 for mathematical tasks, MMLU for general knowledge and AlpacaEval 2.0 for question-and-answer performance. It also ranks among the top performers on a UC Berkeley-affiliated leaderboard called Chatbot Arena. Washington has banned the export of high-end technologies such as GPU semiconductors to China in a bid to stall the country’s advances in AI – the key frontier in the US-China contest for tech supremacy. But DeepSeek’s progress suggests Chinese AI engineers have worked around the restrictions, focusing on greater efficiency with limited resources. While it remains unclear how much advanced AI-training hardware DeepSeek has had access to, the company’s demonstrated enough to suggest the trade restrictions were not entirely effective in stymieing China’s progress. Tech stocks plunged on Wall Street on Monday, led by AI darling Nvidia. Credit: Bloomberg The AI developer has been closely watched since the release of its earliest model in 2023. In November, it gave the world a glimpse of its DeepSeek R1 reasoning model, designed to mimic human thinking. That model underpins its mobile chatbot app, which together with the web interface in January rocketed to global renown as a much cheaper OpenAI alternative. Investor Marc Andreessen called it “AI’s Sputnik moment”. The DeepSeek mobile app was downloaded 1.6 million times by January 25 and ranked No.1 in iPhone app stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the US and the UK, according to data from market tracker App Figures. Born in Guangdong in 1985, Liang received bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electronic and information engineering from Zhejiang University. He founded DeepSeek with 10 million yuan ($2.2 million) in registered capital, according to company database Tianyancha. The bottleneck for further advances is not more fundraising, Liang said in an interview with Chinese outlet 36Kr, but US restrictions on access to the best chips. Most of his top researchers were fresh graduates from top Chinese universities, he said, stressing the need for China to develop its own domestic ecosystem akin to the one built around Nvidia and its AI chips. “More investment does not necessarily lead to more innovation. Otherwise, large companies would take over all innovation,” Liang said. China’s technology leaders, from Alibaba and Baidu to Tencent, have poured significant money and resources into the race to acquire hardware and customers for their AI ventures. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s latest release AI’s “Sputnik moment”. Credit: Bloomberg Alongside Kai-Fu Lee’s 01.AI start-up, DeepSeek stands out with its open-source approach – designed to recruit the largest number of users quickly before developing monetisation strategies atop that large audience. Because DeepSeek’s models are more affordable, it’s already played a role in helping drive down costs for AI developers in China, where the bigger players have engaged in a price war that’s seen successive waves of price cuts over the past year and a half. One of Donald Trump’s first announcements since retaking the US presidency was Stargate, a new ambitious joint venture designed to unlock up to $US500 billion in private sector investment to fund AI infrastructure, create more than 100,000 jobs, and help the US stay ahead of the likes of China. DeepSeek’s rapid ascent will add a deeper sense of urgency to what was already a fast-moving collaborative effort. “What we want to do is we want to keep it [AI] in this country. China is a competitor; others are competitors. We want to be in this country, and we’re making it available,” Trump said at a press conference at the White House. “I’m gonna help a lot through emergency declarations because we have an emergency; we have to get this stuff built. So they have to produce a lot of electricity. And we’ll make it possible for them to get this production done easily, at their own plants, if they want.” DeepSeek’s success may push OpenAI and other US providers to lower pricing to maintain their established lead. It also calls into question the vast spending by companies such as Meta and Microsoft – each of which has committed to capex of $US65 billion ($103 billion) or more this year, largely on AI infrastructure – if more efficient models can compete with a much smaller outlay. That roiled global stock markets as investors sold off companies such as Nvidia and ASML that have benefited from booming demand for AI services. Shares in Chinese names linked to DeepSeek, such as Iflytek, climbed. Developers around the world are already experimenting with DeepSeek’s software and looking to build tools with it. That could quicken the adoption of advanced AI reasoning models — while also potentially touching off additional concerns about the need for guardrails around their use. DeepSeek’s advances may hasten regulation to control how AI is developed. Like all other Chinese AI models, DeepSeek self-censors on topics deemed sensitive in China. It deflects queries about the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests or geopolitically fraught questions such as the possibility of China invading Taiwan. In tests, the DeepSeek bot is capable of giving detailed responses about political figures such as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi but declines to do so about Chinese President Xi Jinping. DeepSeek’s cloud infrastructure is likely to be tested by its sudden popularity. The company briefly experienced a major outage on January 27 and will have to manage even more traffic as new and returning users pour more queries into its chatbot. It said it was hit by a cyberattack on Monday that disrupted users’ ability to register on the site. The company, whose artificial intelligence chatbot has sent the tech world into a frenzy, said that it had suffered “large-scale malicious attacks” on its services.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp.’s plunge, fueled by investor concern about Chinese artificial-intelligence startup DeepSeek, erased a record amount of stock-market value from the world’s largest company. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Newsom Enlists Magic Johnson, Guggenheim CEO for LA Rebuilding Budapest Mayor Aims to Block Orban’s Plans to Build ‘Mini Dubai’ NYC Subway’s Most Dangerous Stations Are on Lexington Ave. Line Nvidia shares tumbled 17% Monday, the biggest drop since March 2020, erasing $589 billion from the company’s market capitalization. That eclipsed the previous record — a 9% drop in September that wiped out about $279 billion in value — and was the biggest in US stock-market history. The drop rippled through the rest of the market due to how much weight Nvidia has in major indexes. Including Monday’s slump, Nvidia selloffs have caused eight of the top ten biggest one-day drops in the S&P 500 Index, based on market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&P 500 fell 1.5% Monday and the Nasdaq 100 tumbled nearly 3%. The semiconductor maker led a broader selloff in technology stocks after DeepSeek’s low-cost approach reignited concerns that big US companies have poured too much money into developing artificial intelligence. The Chinese firm appears to provide a comparable performance at a fraction of the price. All About DeepSeek and Its Lower-Cost AI Model: QuickTake The latest AI model of DeepSeek, released last week, is widely seen as competitive with those of OpenAI and Meta Platforms Inc. The open-sourced product was founded by quant-fund chief Liang Wenfeng and is now at the top of Apple Inc.’s App Store rankings. “Concerns have immediately emerged that it could be a disruptor to the current AI business model, which relies on high end chips and extensive computing power and hence energy,” Jefferies analysts said in a note to clients. Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the influx in spending on AI because they design semiconductors used in the technology. While that heavy spending looks poised to continue, investors may grow wary of rewarding companies that aren’t showing a sufficient return on the investment. Meta announced plans on Friday to boost capital expenditures on AI projects this year by about half to as much as $65 billion, sending its shares to a record high. That came on the heels of OpenAI, SoftBank Group Corp. and Oracle Corp. announcing a $100 billion joint venture called Stargate to build out data centers and AI infrastructure projects around the US. In a bid to stall China’s progress in AI, the US has banned the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to the country and is limiting sales of advanced Nvidia AI chips to others. But DeepSeek’s progress suggests Chinese AI engineers have found a way to work around the export bans, focusing on greater efficiency with limited resources. Nvidia said in a statement Monday that DeepSeek’s model is an “excellent AI advancement” and indicated that the Chinese company didn’t violate US restrictions that limit access to advanced US chips in creating its technology. It also added that inference, or the work of running AI models, requires “requires significant numbers of Nvidia GPUs and high-performance networking.” --With assistance from Philip Sanders and Cagan Koc.

The chipmaker's stock price plummeted 17% to close at $118.58. It was Nvidia's worst day on the market since March 16, 2020, which was early in the Covid pandemic. After Nvidia surpassed Apple last week to become the most valuable publicly traded company, the stock's drop Monday led a 3.1% slide in the tech-heavy Nasdaq. The sell-off was sparked by concerns that Chinese artificial intelligence lab DeepSeek is presenting increased competition in the global AI battle. In late December, DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it said took only two months and less than $6 million to build, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia called H800s. Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs, dominate the market for AI data center chips in the U.S., with tech giants such as Alphabet, Meta and Amazon spending billions of dollars on the processors to train and run their AI models. Analysts at Cantor wrote in a report Monday that the release of DeepSeek's latest technology has caused "great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs." The analysts said they "think this view is farthest from the truth" and that advancements in AI will most likely lead to "the AI industry wanting more compute, not less." They recommend buying Nvidia shares. But after Nvidia's huge run-up — the stock soared 239% in 2023 and 171% in 2024 — the market is on edge about any possible pullback in spending. Broadcom, the other big U.S. chipmaker to see giant valuation gains from AI, fell 17% on Monday, pulling its market cap down by $200 billion. Data center companies reliant on Nvidia's GPUs for their hardware sales saw big sell-offs as well. Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Super Micro Computer dropped at least 5.8%. Oracle, a part of President Donald Trump's latest AI initiative, fell 14%. For Nvidia, the loss was more than double the $279 billion drop the company saw in September, which was the biggest one-day market value loss in history at the time, unseating Meta's $232 billion loss in 2022. Before that, the steepest drop was $182 billion by Apple in 2020. Nvidia's decline is more than double the market cap of Coca-Cola and Chevron and exceeds the market value of both Oracle and Netflix. CEO Jensen Huang's net worth also took a massive hit, declining roughly $21 billion, according to Forbes' real-time billionaires list. The move demoted Huang to 17th on the richest-person list. The sudden excitement around DeepSeek over the weekend pushed its app past OpenAI's ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple's app store. The model's development comes despite a slew of recent curbs on U.S. chip exports to China. Venture capitalist David Sacks, who was tapped by Trump to be the White House's AI and crypto czar, wrote on X that DeepSeek's model "shows that the AI race will be very competitive" and that Trump was right to rescind President Joe Biden's executive order last week on AI safety. "I'm confident in the U.S. but we can't be complacent," Sacks wrote. Nvidia is now the third most-valuable public company, behind Apple and Microsoft.

Title: Apple is well-positioned as DeepSeek threatens AI giants, analysts say

Big Tech is reeling from the seemingly sudden popularity of a big new Chinese AI name, but Apple could benefit from a disruption to its competitors' efforts. DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence startup, released the AI model R1 on January 20. Many in the tech industry believe DeepSeek's large language models could threaten some of the biggest AI players, including Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI. DeepSeek has spooked markets because it appears to deliver models that are as effective as US versions but much cheaper to produce because they run on less powerful chips. That undercuts Google, OpenAI, and others' ability to charge premium prices to access the best of their AI models. The Netherlands-based chipmaker ASML's shares fell by 7%, while the AI chip giant Nvidia's stock dropped by more than 17% on Monday. Apple, however, is in a relatively good position, tech analysts told Business Insider. Its stock rose on Monday, while competitors Alphabet and Microsoft traded down. "Apple would be a beneficiary if the cost of AI training declined," Gene Munster, the managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said. One reason Apple stands to gain from cheaper AI training is that it "rightly focuses on how to integrate AI as a product, rather than building the most cutting-edge models," William Kerwin, a tech analyst at Morningstar, said. Apple could integrate LLMs and improve Apple Intelligence at a cheaper rate than competitors and ultimately keep costs down for consumers, Kerwin said. If DeepSeek proves that powerful AI capabilities are achievable for a fraction of what most AI companies are spending, it could "benefit Apple by leveling the playing field and allowing it to accelerate AI integration plans without making excessive capital expenditures," Jacob Bourne, an analyst at BI's sister company EMARKETER, said. Apple has been criticized for being slow to put out its AI offerings. It released Apple Intelligence software last year, months after its Big Tech competitors launched their versions and years after OpenAI launched ChatGPT. By spending less on AI infrastructure, Bourne said, Apple has some insulation from the fallout its US competitors are facing. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Tech leaders like Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta's Mark Zuckerberg have maintained that investing heavily in AI is worth the risk — Meta is expected to invest over $60 billion in AI infrastructure in 2025. Apple's AI spending appears to be lower than that. Although the iPhone maker hasn't disclosed exactly what it spent on AI in 2024, it reported $45.6 billion in payments for property, plant, and equipment in the fiscal year — up from $43.7 billion in 2023. Those costs would likely include more than just AI spending. Jump to

"DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling," an Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC on Monday. "DeepSeek's work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant." The comments come after DeepSeek last week released R1, which is an open-source reasoning model that reportedly outperformed the best models from U.S. companies such as OpenAI. R1's self-reported training cost was less than $6 million, which is a fraction of the billions that Silicon Valley companies are spending to build their artificial intelligence models. Nvidia's statement indicates that it sees DeepSeek's breakthrough as creating more work for the American chipmaker's graphics processing units, or GPUs. "Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking," the spokesperson added. "We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling." Nvidia also said that the GPUs that DeepSeek used were fully export compliant. That counters Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang's comments on CNBC last week that he believed DeepSeek used Nvidia GPUs models which are banned in mainland China. DeepSeek says it used special versions of Nvidia's GPUs intended for the Chinese market. Analysts are now asking if multibillion-dollar capital investments from companies like Microsoft, Google and Meta for Nvidia-based AI infrastructure are being wasted when the same results can be achieved more cheaply. Earlier this month, Microsoft said it is spending $80 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025 alone while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week said the social media company planned to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capital expenditures in 2025 as part of its AI strategy. "If model training costs prove to be significantly lower, we would expect a near-term cost benefit for advertising, travel, and other consumer app companies that use cloud AI services, while long-term hyperscaler AI-related revenues and costs would likely be lower," wrote BofA Securities analyst Justin Post in a note Monday. Nvidia's comment also reflects a new theme that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella have discussed in recent months. Much of the AI boom and the demand for Nvidia GPUs was driven by the "scaling law," a concept in AI development proposed by OpenAI researchers in 2020. That concept suggested that better AI systems could be developed by greatly expanding the amount of computation and data that went into building a new model, requiring more and more chips. Since November, Huang and Altman have been focusing on a new wrinkle to the scaling law, which Huang calls "test-time scaling." This concept says that if a fully trained AI model spends more time using extra computer power when making predictions or generating text or images to allow it to "reason," it will provided better answers than it would have if it ran for less time. Forms of the test-time scaling law are used in some of OpenAI's models such as o1 as well as DeepSeek's breakthrough R1 model.

Title: DeepSeek: all the news about the startup that’s shaking up AI stocks

by Verge Staff DeepSeek is shaking up the AI industry with cost-efficient large language models it claims can perform just as well as rivals from giants like OpenAI and Meta. The Chinese startup says its flagship R1 reasoning model is capable of achieving “performance comparable” to OpenAI’s o1 equivalent, while the newly released Janus Pro multimodal AI model can supposedly outperform Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 3. DeepSeek’s ChatGPT competitor quickly soared to the top of the App Store, and the company is disrupting financial markets, with shares of Nvidia dipping 17 percent to cut nearly $600 billion from its market cap on January 27th, which CNBC said is the biggest single-day drop in US history. The AI assistant is powered by the startup’s “state-of-the-art” DeepSeek-V3 model, allowing users to ask questions, plan trips, generate text, and more. As downloads of DeepSeek’s app spiked, the startup began restricting signups due to “malicious attacks.” Launched in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, DeepSeek has garnered attention for building open-source AI models using less cash and fewer GPUs when compared to the billions spent by OpenAI, Meta, Google, Microsoft, and others. If DeepSeek’s performance claims are true, it could prove that the startup managed to build powerful AI models despite strict US export controls preventing chipmakers like Nvidia from selling high-performance graphics cards in China. Here’s all the latest on DeepSeek. Jess Weatherbed Chinese artificial intelligence company DeepSeek disrupted Silicon Valley with the release of cheaply developed AI models that compete with flagship offerings from OpenAI — but the ChatGPT maker suspects they were built upon OpenAI data. OpenAI and Microsoft are investigating whether the Chinese rival used OpenAI’s API to integrate OpenAI’s AI models into DeepSeek’s own models, according to Bloomberg. The outlet’s sources said Microsoft security researchers detected that large amounts of data were being exfiltrated through OpenAI developer accounts in late 2024, which the company believes are affiliated with DeepSeek. Kylie Robison and Elizabeth Lopatto It took about a month for the finance world to start freaking out about DeepSeek, but when it did, it took more than half a trillion dollars — or one entire Stargate — off Nvidia’s market cap. It wasn’t just Nvidia, either: Tesla, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft tanked. DeepSeek’s two AI models, released in quick succession, put it on par with the best available from American labs, according to Alexandr Wang, Scale AI CEO. And DeepSeek seems to be working within constraints that mean it trained much more cheaply than its American peers. One of its recent models is said to cost just $5.6 million in the final training run, which is about the salary an American AI expert can command. Last year, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said the cost of training models ranged from $100 million to $1 billion. OpenAI’s GPT-4 cost more than $100 million, according to CEO Sam Altman. DeepSeek seems to have just upended our idea of how much AI costs, with potentially enormous implications across the industry. Richard Lawler Now that a Chinese startup has captured a lot of the AI buzz, what happens next? The ChatGPT boss says of his company, “we will obviously deliver much better models and also it’s legit invigorating to have a new competitor,” then, naturally, turns the conversation to AGI. Richard Lawler Without going into detail about what might happen to the $52 billion in subsidies from the CHIPS Act under his administration, Donald Trump said tariffs on foreign computer chips, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals are coming “in the near future.” He also namechecked DeepSeek’s AI releases, saying, “...coming up with a faster method of AI and less expensive, that’s good. I view that as a positive if it is fact and it is true, and nobody knows, but I view that as a positive.” In the speech at the House GOP Issues Conference held at the Trump National Doral Resort in Miami Monday afternoon, he said that to return the production of these goods to the US, “we don’t want to give them billions of dollars like this ridiculous program Biden has.” Instead the incentive for manufacturers will be “they will not want to pay a tax.” Richard Lawler As Chinese AI startup DeepSeek draws attention for open-source AI models that it says are cheaper than the competition while providing similar or better performance, AI chip king Nvidia’s stock price dropped today. CNBC said that after closing at $118.58, down 17 percent, this was “the biggest drop ever for a U.S. company.” Emma Roth In a statement to Bloomberg, an Nvidia spokesperson said DeepSeek is an “excellent AI advancement” and shows how a company can create new AI models using the test-time scaling method, while “leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant.” [Bloomberg] Richard Lawler Already riding a wave of hype over its R1 “reasoning” AI that is atop the app store charts and shifting the stock market, Chinese startup DeepSeek has released another new open-source AI model: Janus-Pro. Input image analysis is limited to 384x384 resolution, but the company says the largest version, Janus-Pro-7b, beat comparable models on two AI benchmark tests. Correction: As TechCrunch notes, Janus-Pro image input is listed as limited to low resolution, not its output. Jess Weatherbed After surging to the top of Apple’s App Store charts in the US, DeepSeek’s AI Assistant is now restricting new user sign-ups. According to an incident report page, registrations are being temporarily limited “due to large-scale malicious attacks on DeepSeek’s services,” though it’s unclear how these limitations are being applied. “Existing users can log in as usual,” DeepSeek said in its update. “Thanks for your understanding and support.” An alert banner on the DeepSeek web sign-up page says that “registration may be busy,” rather than entirely restricted, however, and encourages users to wait and “try again” if their application is unsuccessful. Jess Weatherbed A chatbot made by Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek has rocketed to the top of Apple’s App Store charts in the US this week, dethroning OpenAI’s ChatGPT as the most downloaded free app. The eponymous AI assistant is powered by DeepSeek’s open-source models, which the company says can be trained at a fraction of the cost using far fewer chips than the world’s leading models. The claim has riled financial markets, with Nvidia’s share price dropping over 12 percent in pre-market trading. Downloads for the app exploded shortly after DeepSeek released its new R1 reasoning model on January 20th, which is designed for solving complex problems and reportedly performs as well as OpenAI’s o1 on certain benchmarks.

Support independent journalism Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au This year's International Holocaust Remembrance Day marks 80 years since the Soviet liberation of Auschwitz, and a new Chinese AI app has wreaked havoc on the US markets. Rich James Jan 28, 2025 Leaders from around the world have joined with Auschwitz survivors to mark the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi Germany death camp. Reuters says the ceremony has been seen as “one of the last such gatherings of those who experienced its horrors”. 86-year-old Tova Friedman, who was six when she was among the 7,000 people liberated by Soviet troops on January 27, 1945, told the Associated Press she also believed it would be the last gathering of Auschwitz survivors. Having travelled from her home in New Jersey to Poland this week, she told the newswire: “The world has become toxic. I realise that we’re in a crisis again, that there is so much hatred around, so much distrust, that if we don’t stop, it may get worse and worse. There may be another terrible destruction.” The BBC reports the ceremony included “graphic accounts of what the survivors endured, followed by appeals for tolerance and combating antisemitism”. The broadcaster said German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, French President Emmanuel Macron and King Charles III “made passionate statements” but “the words echoing in the shadow of Birkenau’s Death Gate belong to the dwindling number of survivors”. The ceremony ended with survivors and world leaders lighting candles at the empty wooden train car, which sits on the tracks at Auschwitz. Yesterday Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese attended a Holocaust memorial service at JHUB Maccabi Community Centre in Perth and pledged $4.4 million to build a national Holocaust education centre in Canberra, as well as $2 million to upgrade the Holocaust Education Centre in Western Australia. The PM said in a statement: “On International Holocaust Remembrance Day, we hold on to the memories of millions. We reflect on the great multitude of Jewish life that the Holocaust robbed from the world — all of that energy, potential, inspiration, talent and love — and we hold their names and their faces in our hearts. We tend to these memories because we cannot allow the Holocaust to recede into history. It was a pitiless and unrelenting act of cruelty that was long in the planning, cold in its calculation, and carried out on a scale that falls across the decades like a terrible shadow.” The ABC reported ahead of the ceremony that Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong, who was at the Auschwitz ceremony, said: “We are here to say, never again. I would say at this time, we have to stand together across beliefs, across political difference, across politics, we have to stand against prejudice and hate and antisemitism in all its forms. When we say never again we have to not only mean it, but bring that to what we do as political leaders.” Guardian Australia and many others picked up Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus, who is also in Poland, responding to a question about Opposition Leader Peter Dutton’s criticism of Wong attending the ceremony. Dreyfus said it was “grotesque to see attempts being made to politicise either commemoration of the Holocaust or combating antisemitism. We need to get politics out of this.” Dutton said in a statement marking International Holocaust Remembrance Day: “Today we remember the six million Jews whose lives were exterminated by the Nazis in an act so calculated and cruel it constitutes one of the most monstrous crimes in human history.” He added: “In the magnitude of antisemitism which is plaguing Western democracies today — including Australia — many citizens who have read about the history and horrors of the Holocaust have, for the first time, grasped how that catastrophe eventuated. They have seen, with their own eyes, a type of hate that, if left unchecked, unleashes greater evils.” The Coalition leader said if elected his government would aim for every schoolchild to visit a Holocaust museum as well as provide “$19 million to Australian Holocaust museums to support their expansion and to commemorate the victims of Hamas’ terrorist attack on Israel on October 7, 2023”. The ceasefire between Hamas and Israel is now in its second week and Monday saw hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians return to their homes — or the ruins where their homes once stood — in northern Gaza, the BBC reports. The Guardian says thousands crossed the border on Monday morning after Israel “opened military checkpoints that had divided the strip for more than a year”. The AFP news agency reports a Gaza security official claimed “more than 200,000 displaced people have returned to Gaza and North Gaza” in the first two hours of Monday. The newswire also reports the Israeli government has said eight of the hostages held in Gaza due for release in the first phase of the ceasefire deal are dead. So, hands up if you’ve heard of the Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek? You certainly will have by the end of this morning. The low-cost app has caused all kinds of havoc on Wall Street in recent hours, with shares in major US technology firms falling steeply in value after the sudden emergence of DeepSeek. The BBC says the app, which was launched last week, has overtaken rivals including ChatGPT to become the most downloaded free app in the US. The initial impact on the markets made headlines around the world as “investors made a quick exit from several big-name tech stocks”, as the British broadcaster puts it. For example, AI chip maker Nvidia saw its share price drop 16%, wiping $500 billion off its value, on Monday. CNN says DeepSeek’s “surprise advancement” has “threatened the aura of invincibility surrounding America’s technology industry”. (You’ll remember US President Donald Trump announced to much fanfare his $500 billion Stargate AI project last Tuesday, the day before DeepSeek released its open-source model.) The US broadcaster provides a handy summary of why DeepSeek has caused such a scene: “DeepSeek, a one-year-old startup, revealed a stunning capability last week: It presented a ChatGPT-like AI model called R1, which has all the familiar abilities, operating at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI’s, Google’s or Meta’s popular AI models. The company said it had spent just $5.6 million on computing power for its base model, compared with the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars US companies spend on their AI technologies,” CNN said. WIRED also also a very handy explainer here. Many publications have picked up on tech investor Marc Andreessen declaring on X: “Deepseek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen.” Fortune highlights Andreessen also said: “DeepSeek-R1 is AI’s Sputnik moment”. Meanwhile, WIRED also reports the company said on Monday it was temporarily limiting new sign-ups due to “large-scale malicious attacks” on its services. As the market continues to watch what is happening to US tech stock, domestically all eyes are set to be on the December quarter inflation rate when the Australian Bureau of Statistics releases the data at 11.30am AEDT tomorrow. The ABC states the “nation’s economists, bankers and mortgagees [will be] clustered, agog, around their screens” for the figures. The broadcaster has an interesting analysis piece on why it’s not as simple as, “if the Wednesday figures are low the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut interest rates next month”. You can read it here. It won’t just be the economists and market traders gathered around their screens for the inflation stats, you can be sure politicians will be as well, ready to spin the results in the direction they need. Talking of waiting for something to happen. Does anyone know when Trump is going to get around to ringing Albanese in an official capacity now he’s US president? The 78-year-old is certainly making his way down the list of other world leaders… Another day, another headline for Elon Musk. But this one is a bit different to the rest. USA Today reports that on January 2 the Minor Planet Center announced the discovery of a new asteroid, complete with an official name: 2018 CN41. Unfortunately, less than 17 hours later the asteroid was deleted from the organisation’s record and an editorial note issued stating “it was pointed out the orbit matches an artificial object 2018-017A, Falcon Heavy Upper stage with the Tesla roadster”. That’s right, the object was not an asteroid, it was in fact the Tesla car Musk blasted into space on a Space X Falcon rocket in 2018. Astronomy reports the asteroid/car had first been “identified” and submitted by a citizen scientist. The site adds: “The case of mistaken identity was resolved swiftly in a collaboration between professional and amateur astronomers. But some astronomers say it is also emblematic of a growing issue: the lack of transparency from nations and companies operating craft in deep space, beyond the orbits used by most satellites.” (While we’re here, please feel free to keep sending me feedback, things you’d like to see more/less of in the Worm and any tips you may have to worm@crikey.com.au.) I want debate to be respectful… and that’s a choice that she made. People are allowed to express themselves, but I thought it was disrespectful of the event and of the people who that event was primarily for. Anthony Albanese The prime minister was yesterday asked about former Australian of the Year Grace Tame wearing a T-shirt with “Fuck Murdoch” written on its front during a reception at The Lodge at the weekend. Asked if he agreed with the t-shirt’s sentiment, Albanese said: “I clearly disagree.” Tame meanwhile declared: “It’s a great shirt and says it all, doesn’t it?” Changing the date alone will not erase the scars of colonisation, but it is a powerful gesture of Australia’s willingness to listen, learn, and take action towards reconciliation. It is a call for all Australians to walk together on a path of truth-telling and healing. Only then can we move to honour the past. Let’s create celebrations that unite, rather than exclude people; celebrations where everyone can feel welcome, whether their family has called Australia home for five years or 50,000 years. By shifting the focus of Australia Day, we can create a nation that celebrates not just its achievements but its capacity for growth and understanding. January 26 may always carry its historical weight, but our future as a unified nation requires that we honour it with the respect and reflection it deserves — by changing the date we celebrate. Managing but not governing. In charge but not in power. Deciding but not leading. That was the prime minister on display at Friday’s National Press Club address — unveiling another managerial tweak to the economy, denouncing his opponent, and promising voters more of the same that they’ve been given over the past two-and-a-half years. Business as usual isn’t going to cut it. The drift in Labor’s support has been happening for 18 months, to the point where it’s impossible to see the government retaining its majority. But there are weeks, and likely months, until the election. Don’t think that drift can’t continue to the point where a Dutton government, even a majority government, becomes odds-on. Peter Dutton leads a pack of duds, and his policies — where he has them — are an embarrassing confection of innumeracy and MAGA Down Under cut-and-pastes. Labor should be setting itself up for an extended period in government. Instead, Anthony Albanese is quietly leading it to defeat. Since last year’s council nomination fiasco, the NSW Liberal division has been under federal takeover, a move aimed at ensuring candidate selection for the upcoming federal election goes smoothly. But with a handful of Sydney seats still without candidates, some in the party worry the takeover committee hasn’t solved the party’s admin challenges. “The impression is that everything was going to be fixed by [the federal takeover] — but are we any better off than we were a year ago?” a Liberal source told Crikey. The NSW seats where the Liberals lack candidates are the Western Sydney electorates of Blaxland, Chifley, McMahon, Watson and Fowler, as well as the inner-city seat of Sydney. How the Mafia is weaponising wildfires (CNN) ‘Declaration of war’: M23 rebels claim seizing key DR Congo city of Goma (al-Jazeera) Two hundred UK companies sign up for permanent four-day working week (The Guardian) Elon Musk, video game king? Well, maybe not (The New York Times) ($) Hegseth, Trump’s Pentagon ‘disrupter,’ vows swift action (The Washington Post) New Zealand eases visa rules for ‘digital nomads’ to boost tourism (BBC) Neale Daniher’s worthy recognition is a unique opportunity to change the conversation about the NDIS — George Taleporos (Guardian Australia): What I hope will come from Daniher’s recognition goes beyond this. I hope to see a shift in the national dialogue around the NDIS. The NDIS is a lifeline for countless Australians such as Daniher, living with complex disabilities, providing the means for us to live with dignity, independence and control over our lives. Whether it’s through funding for personal care, wheelchairs, therapies, or other supports, the NDIS empowers individuals to live as active members of society. Yet, despite its transformative impact, the national dialogue around the NDIS has become alarmingly negative. Media headlines are dominated by stories of cost blowouts, fraud and inefficiencies, overshadowing the real stories of lives changed and opportunities created. This persistent focus on the scheme’s financial cost has contributed to a public discourse that too often portrays people with disabilities as financial burdens and the NDIS as an unnecessary and out-of-control strain on taxpayers and our economy. Australia must face down US tech bosses and Trump – Paul Smith (AFR): Regardless of whether you agree with the media bargaining or social media age limit policies, scrapping them to pre-emptively appease Trump would be a horrible show of weakness. If a foreign country (and supposed ally) wants to make it uneconomical for Australians to live there, then perhaps it is no longer a country they should be living in. If a policy of going hard to hold tech companies like Meta and Google to account was right when Joe Biden was president — and both sides of Australian politics thought it was — then it is still right today.

Title: DeepSeek displaces ChatGPT as the App Store’s top app

On iOS, DeepSeek is currently the No. 1 free app in the U.S. App Store and 51 other countries, according to mobile app analytics firm Appfigures. The rapid rise of DeepSeek in the app stores’ Top Charts follows its meteoric rise in popularity this week resulting from the release of a series of open AI models that are competitive with leading offerings from OpenAI and Google. However, compared to other frontier AI models, DeepSeek claims its models were trained for just a fraction of the price with significantly worse AI chips. This represents new efficiency gains for AI model training, which sent Nvidia’s stock price tumbling down as much as 17% on Monday and has put the rest of the tech industry on high alert. On Friday, DeepSeek’s mobile app had just a million downloads across both the App Store and Google Play. That number has since doubled as of Monday morning, to 2.6 million downloads of DeepSeek’s mobile app across both platforms. The app currently sits in the Top 10 list for free apps in 111 countries on the App Store and in 18 countries on Google Play, according to Appfigures. In addition, more than 80% of DeepSeek’s total mobile app downloads have come in the past seven days, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower. In that time frame, DeepSeek saw nearly 300% more app downloads than Perplexity, another leading consumer AI app. DeepSeek moved into its No. 1 spot on the U.S. App Store on Sunday, January 26, up from No. 31 just a couple days prior. Meanwhile, DeepSeek is the No. 14 Overall free app on Google Play, rapidly climbing up from No. 133 on January 24. As a result, daily active users jumped both globally and in the U.S. by over 110% from January 24 to 25 compared with the same period last week. While China is the largest mobile app market for DeepSeek today, it represents only 23% of its total downloads, according to Sensor Tower. The app’s second and third largest markets are the United States, which makes up 15% of its total downloads, and Egypt, which makes up 6% of its total downloads. The popularity of DeepSeek’s mobile app raises questions about the moat of popular consumer AI apps, such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity. While hundreds of millions of people use ChatGPT and Gemini every month, DeepSeek proves that the consumer AI space is still volatile, and new competitors shouldn’t be counted out. However, it’s worth noting that reaching the No. 1 position on the App Store isn’t just calculated by app downloads alone. Apple’s algorithm, though secretive, is a combination of numerous factors, including velocity of the installs and more. That allows apps that gain installs quickly to skyrocket to the top of the charts, overtaking others that may have a larger total number of users or installs. It will be more telling to see how long DeepSeek holds its top position over time. The tech industry is still coming to terms with the techniques DeepSeek used to train its AI models, and what it means for the broader AI space. In light of DeepSeek’s R1 model, leading AI model providers may be feeling pressured to release better models to prove their dominance, or justify the hefty price they’re paying for compute. Meta has reportedly created several “war rooms” to analyze DeepSeek’s training methods. DeepSeek’s rise in popularity was potentially stifled by “large-scale malicious” attacks, the company reported on Monday, which forced it to limit customers outside of China from registering for the app. Additional reporting by Sarah Perez.

Bird Song of the Day Brown Thrasher, Elkinsville Rd. and Kirk’s Ford Rd., Brown, Indiana, United States. Grab a cup of coffee for nineteen minutes of thrashing! * * * In Case You Might Miss… * * * Politics “So many of the social reactions that strike us as psychological are in fact a rational management of symbolic capital.” –Pierre Bourdieu, Classification Struggles * * * Trump Administration “Scoop: How Trump’s ‘black box’ limits outside influences” [Axios]. “President Trump is surprising — even frustrating — some longtime friends in his second administration’s early days with fewer leaks, a lack of exploitable rivalries, and tighter restrictions on access to him. Why it matters: No modern president has done more — across more areas of American policy, culture and life — than Trump in the past six days. This new operating style and system enabled a strategy of flooding the nation with so many huge moves that it’s hard for critics to attack specific ones.” And: “It’s stunning to veterans of Trump’s first West Wing. But at least in Week 1, the new government has mirrored the discipline of his 2024 campaign operation — another sharp contrast with his previous teams…. There’s a ‘strong silo system’ that has kept advocates and special interests from forum-shopping and end-running administration officials, the lobbyist added.” Interestingly: “The biggest change of all, Axios has learned, is that White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles and other aides have clamped down on the ability of random friends and reporters to call Trump directly. Until now, if you had his phone number and called, Trump would answer and talk to you — and maybe even act on whatever you suggested. Now, Trump wants to focus more on work and has less time for bull sessions so he’s less prone to answer his phone.” • Of course, some might suggest that we want Trump to “work” as little possible. “Confident, organised, still freewheeling: Trump 2.0 has learned from past” [BBC]. “The stacks of leather-bound executive orders piled high on the Resolute Desk illustrate how the Trump 2.0 era is set against a different political landscape from four years ago – one which has produced a more emboldened commander-in-chief…. ‘It’s been much more disciplined, on-point and issue-focused,’ said Lawrence Muir, a former official in the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. Mr Muir, who was tasked with hiring administration personnel as part of the 2016 Trump transition team, told the BBC his work was ‘essentially discarded’ by the incoming White House at the time. ‘They did not have a great idea about what they were supposed to be producing, or how to produce it,’ he said. ‘[Trump’s] doing much better this time in terms of what he’s getting out, getting it out efficiently, and knowing how it has to be enforced down through the agencies.'” * * * “Trump’s agenda is about to hit a make-or-break moment” [Politico]. “House Republicans are heading to President Donald Trump’s Miami-area resort for their annual policy retreat…. The biggest task for the gathering at Trump National Doral: Finalize a budget blueprint plan for the massive, party-line bill they’re planning, touching energy, border security and tax policy. But to do that, Republicans need to decide what will go in that package — with the price tag of Trump’s priorities reaching $10 trillion over 10 years — versus what might be included in a separate, bipartisan government funding bill that will be negotiated with Democrats over the next seven weeks. The fate of a necessary debt ceiling increase is top of mind…. The planned retreat discussions have been tailored to show attending members the possibilities for the way forward and to take their temperatures on potential spending cuts, according to three Republicans with direct knowledge of the planning. Leaders will have to carefully balance sometimes competing interests from various GOP factions.” And: “Centrists are also relaying their concerns to GOP leaders about some committees’ plans to target pieces of the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that provides food aid benefits for more than 40 million low-income Americans…. Those proposals are relatively more palatable for GOP lawmakers in competitive districts than the massive cuts to current benefits some conservatives would prefer. But they’re still politically divisive and could provide Democrats major campaign fodder in blue and purple districts ahead of the 2026 midterms.” • But cutting Medicaid, though easy and fun, won’t get those trillions. It never does. * * * “Trump actions could wreak havoc on South Florida’s sizeable Colombian population” [Miami Herald]. “Florida is home to 473,606 Colombians, according to the U.S. Census data. The state has long been a magnet for new arrivals from the South American country who are seeking a place where there are many Spanish speakers, a warm climate and a ready-made community.” • Interestingly, the story doesn’t sat what percentage of those new arrivals have their papers in order. “Trump wants to tackle inflation. Will these top actions bring prices down?” [WaPo]. The deck: “Here’s six key actions, executive orders and promises, from this past week and how they would affect inflation.” More: “‘The reality is, inflation of the type we have gets embedded into the economy and takes a long time to wring out,’ said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank. ‘There aren’t many quick solutions.'” Be that as it may, the six: Immigration crackdowns, deportations [▲]; New tariffs and trade policies [▲]; Expanding oil and gas drilling, other energy overhauls [▼]; Rolling back regulations [▼]; Undoing Biden’s efforts to lower prescription drug prices[?]; Lowering interest rates[▲].” • Triangles for what WaPo thinks could go up, or down. “Trump shocks the system. Will he solve problems voters care about most?” [Dan Balz, WaPo]. “The larger issue for Trump, and what ultimately will determine the political and substantive success of his second term, is whether this flurry of activity signaling a major course change will result in the betterment of the lives of the voters who supported him in November. Getting rid of DEI offices and personnel will cheer his most loyal supporters and hurt a federal workforce in a nation becoming more ethnically diverse. It won’t necessarily help families struggling to pay bills. Deporting millions of undocumented immigrants in fact could raise food prices and further labor shortages…. Shocking the system is one thing. Providing tangible results to people is another.” 2028 “The 12 Democrats who make the most sense for 2028” [WaPo]. Starts out well: “Save for a few months at the tail end of the 2024 campaign, the party hasn’t had an authoritative, dominant leader for a long time.” Really? 2024? Who was that? Anyhow, here are the 12, starting with #12: Tim Walz, Josh Stein, Andy Beshear, Gavin Newsom, Raphael G. Warnock, Wes Moore, Ruben Gallego, John Fetterman, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Gretchen Whitmer, and — at #1! — Josh Shapiro. It’s been a long time since I deployed the “Please kill me now” trope…. Our Famously Free Press “Too Much News, Redux” [Jon Allsop, Columbia Journalism Review]. “I noted in 2020 that the ‘basic rhythms’ of the news business aren’t designed to cope with deluges of huge stories: whatever the day’s news, it must be stretched or shrunk to fill roughly the same number of newspaper column inches or cable news hours; the internet, of course, theoretically offers near-infinite space for news coverage to expand, but many digital formats—from homepages to newsletters—themselves have spatial limits, and that’s before we get into strained newsroom resources and apparently diminished audience buy-in, as Stelter pointed out last week. These constraints make it hard for the news media, as a collective apparatus, to communicate proportion. We have tools for organizing stories by importance—back in 2020, I noted that the New York Times had run thirty-three banner front-page print headlines in less than six months, smashing even its election-year average—but the constant blare of headlines, as I noted, can have a ‘flattening effect, making it harder, over a long period of time, to distinguish actual news from attention hustling.’ The problem of proportionality is recurring now. A story previewing Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s potentially radical plans to ‘target vaccines’ should he be confirmed as health and human services secretary appeared about halfway down a major Politico newsletter on Friday; yesterday, the CIA lab-leak story made the front page of the Times, but only in brief form at the very bottom. Needless to say that in the summer of 2020, both these stories would have been earth-shaking.” • Allsop complains of Trump’s tendency to make news, or at least news stories — “flood the zone with sh*t” — but I think there are more stories out there, as one would expect as a function of slow civilizational collapse (newsrooms are smaller too). Democrats en déshabillé “Playbook: A tough Week One for Democrats” [Politico]. “On Saturday, at their winter meeting in National Harbor, Maryland, Democrats will make their first consequential decision since their November drubbing: selecting a new chair of the DNC. In the opening days of the new administration, Democrats have struggled to frame Republicans, careening from the critique that Trump has surrounded himself with ‘broligarchs,’ as Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) put it, to whether Elon Musk made a Nazi salute. Senate Democrats have zigged and zagged on their Cabinet confirmation votes. Of course, not all nominees are equal. But they are clearly divided over tactics in responding to Trump’s program.” • Maybe — hear me out — the important Democrat problems aren’t at the tactical level? “In the wilderness: Democrats struggle to navigate the politics of new Trump era” [Guardian]. “‘He’s been in office less than a week, and you’ve already seen a federal court with a judge who was appointed by a Republican president – a president that much of the conservative movement in America upholds – say that he’s operating blatantly unconstitutionally,’ said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of the non-profit legal group Democracy Forward. ‘I think what you’re going to see is more sophisticated legal responses this time because civil society, I think, is much more organized and savvy to this playbook.’ Democracy Forward is one of more than 350 organizations that have joined a coalition known as Democracy 2025, which has the explicit aim of ‘disrupting any efforts by the Trump-Vance administration to attack our rights.’ ‘The message that we want to send to all Americans across the country is thbe doing is demanding a president and a Congress that does the same thing,’ Perryman said.” • So, doubling down on lawfare. 350 organizatioat there are lawyers and advocates who are going to be in court every single day fighting for your rights, and what we need to ns is not a sign of strength. It’s a sign of weakness. Nor are these NGOs representative of “civil society” as a whole. “Trump Just Broke the Law. Blatantly. And He Might Get Away With It” [Michael Tomaskey, The New Republic]. On Trump firing the 15 Inspectors General: “Under the original law, presidents had to give Congress 30 days’ notice about their intent to fire an I.G. and just supply some vague reason why. President Barack Obama’s excuse for firing the I.G. of national service programs was simply a lack of confidence in the guy. Then came Trump. As Bob Bauer and Jack Goldsmith wrote at Lawfare in 2022, ‘More frequently than prior presidents, [Trump] manipulated vacancies and related laws to fire or dismiss disliked inspectors general and replace them, pursuant to the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 (FVRA), with a more like-minded or pliant official.’ So Congress, through a larger defense bill, amended the I.G. law by replacing the word ‘reasons’ with the phrase ‘substantive rationale, including detailed and case-specific reasons.’ In sum, Congress toughened this law because of Trump. And now, Trump has broken the provision that was added in response to his flouting of the original law! That he broke the law is obvious. He didn’t give 30 days’ notice. He didn’t provide any ‘substantive rationale.’ He didn’t provide any reason at all. He just did it. And he told reporters Saturday that it was all fine. ‘It’s a very common thing to do,’ he said. Once he says that, we know that basically every Republican, and Fox News and Sinclair and the rest of the propaganda chamber, are going to say the same thing. Lindsey Graham on Sunday hilariously admitted that ‘technically, yeah,’ Trump broke the law but Graham wasn’t losing any sleep over it.” • It’s a good thing that four solid years of lawfare (eight, if you count RussiaGate) didn’t make people cynical about Democrat accusations of illegality, because this thing looks like it could have legs. Realignment and Legitimacy “Column: The rise of Silicon Valley, from indifference to lords of the political universe” [Los Angeles Times]. “When the high and mighty of Silicon Valley assumed their privileged perch at the swearing-in of President Trump, it was an ostentatious show of wealth and power unlike any before. ‘You could go back to the Gilded Age and you could have a similar concentration of capital and power. You know, Rockefeller and Carnegie,’ said historian Margaret O’Mara, citing two of the richest men who ever bestrode the earth. ‘But they weren’t on the dais of the inauguration.’…. The explanation for their propinquity lies not in the creation of some whiz-bang, life-changing, paradigm-bending consumer product, or the shining virtues or particularly fertile minds that grace Silicon Valley’s fruited plain. ‘It’s one of the oldest truisms in politics,’ said Larry Gerston, a San José State political science professor emeritus, who’s followed the tech industry from a front-row seat for decades. ‘Money buys access.’ Bezos’ Amazon and Zuckerberg’s Meta were among the tech firms that tithed $1 million each to help pay for Trump’s inauguration. Musk invested more than a quarter of a billion dollars to help elect Trump. Given his conjoined-twin closeness to the 47th president, it appears money well spent.'” Syndemics “I am in earnest — I will not equivocate — I will not excuse — I will not retreat a single inch — AND I WILL BE HEARD.” –William Lloyd Garrison * * * Covid Resources, United States (National): Transmission (CDC); Wastewater (CDC, Biobot; includes many counties; Wastewater Scan, includes drilldown by zip); Variants (CDC; Walgreens); “Iowa COVID-19 Tracker” (in IA, but national data). “Infection Control, Emergency Management, Safety, and General Thoughts” (especially on hospitalization by city).

From December 5, 2024: “[D]ata strongly suggests that the virus, known as H5N1, has spread primarily* through milk. It replicates quickly in the udders of infected cows, which produce milk with sky-high levels of the pathogen. Droplets of milk can splash into dairy workers’ faces, while milk-splattered equipment and vehicles can transport the virus from cow to cow…. In theory, a virus that spreads through milk should be easier to control than one that floats invisibly in the air. But a look inside the modern dairy industry reveals that milk-based transmission is profoundly worrying. ‘Milk is hugely problematic,’ said Seema Lakdawala, a virologist at Emory University.” • Detail on how humans and robots milk cows.

Walker even conjectures that our peculiar sleep patterns may explain our evolutionary advance. We sleep less than other primates, but get relatively more REM sleep, and the dreams it brings, than our monkey and ape cousins. It is during REM sleep, Walker insists, that we engage in ’emotional processing.’ The mnemonic collisions during this phase forge new connections among our experiences, and we wake not merely refreshed but revived and enlightened by our re-wrought neural networks.” • Hmm. * * * Contact information for plants: Readers, feel free to contact me at lambert [UNDERSCORE] strether [DOT] corrente [AT] yahoo [DOT] com, to (a) find out how to send me a check if you are allergic to PayPal and (b) to find out how to send me images of plants.

Thank you! Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it. Great links today. Thanks. > Great links today. Thanks. Well, thank you! Love the Hopper painting as well “Rooms for Tourists.” Found this- ‘Edward Hopper’s paintings of buildings are portraits, in which the human presence is implied but not seen. In Rooms for Tourists, Hopper portrays the exterior of a boarding house in Provincetown, Massachusetts. He made study drawings of the building and then traveled there repeatedly at night while he worked on the painting. The contrast between the warm, electrically lit interior and the darkness of night outside captures the sense of transience and impermanence inherent in the boarding house’s impersonal arrivals and departures.’ https://artgallery.yale.edu/collections/objects/52638 “Sir, a second open source AI model from DeepSeek has been revealed” https://www.reuters.com/technology/deepseeks-janus-pro-ai-model-beats-rivals-image-generation-2025-01-27/ > “Sir, a second open source AI model from DeepSeek has been revealed” We need a Sam Altman Downfall parody, for sure.

Moon of Alabama wrote this development up. The Raspberry Pi’s are now sold out. Deepseek software is free and will run on this device. This deserves some recognition. Please stop amplifying nonsense. Deepseek’s frontier model R1 is 671 billion parameters. Model parameters are directly correlated with compute requirements and quality of output. 671 billion parameter model won’t run on a powerful desktop computer, let alone a Raspberry Pi. Even with their optimization tricks, it still has to compute 32 billion parameters. What they were running on pi is a tiny model with terrible output quality. All tiny models (and I have played with many) are toys, and their outputs are completely unreliable. Smaller 7 billion parameter models do run on desktop computers already, including small Llama, Mistral, Gemma etc. models with a 6 core Ryzen CPU running it are an intolerable 20-30 tokens per second. To give you a reference of that speed, the model would output the length of your comment in about 5 seconds. Tiny models with 1 billion parameters run on Rasberry pi’s, and DeepSeek’s tiny-model is not the first one to do so. There are AI video tools that could do this, put his face on Hitler.

By the end of the decade, the Stock Exchange, a nightclub, opened in the renovated building. All-night raves in the site of an abandoned rebar-wreck … I like it!

Democrats doing lawfare is also an admission that the current system services liberal Democrat purposes just fine, Their Democracy, and they don’t have any particular interests in making any changes that might provide material benefits. Kind of mind-bending that we went from the Biggest Threat Ever to Trump is a president to be opposed by gentle lawfare efforts. Wat? Anyone can do lawfare. Part of the Civil Rights Revolution was conducted through the Courts, and that was lawfare. Lawfare was one weapons system and demonstrations/marches/Freedom Rides/etc. was another weapons system and political organizing/registering to vote/voting was another weapons system. Damage suits against the oil companies are lawfare. If lawfare is the only weapons system you have, you use that or you use nothing at all. So the question becomes, who is using lawfare against whom, and in service to what? Democracy 2025. Lambert comments: “So, doubling down on lawfare. 350 organizations is not a sign of strength. It’s a sign of weakness. Nor are these NGOs representative of “civil society” as a whole.” But Lambert, they’re FIGHTING for us. Surely that’s all we need to know, isn’t it?

Surely [bangs head on desk] These lawfare Democrat should count themselves extremely lucky that nobody seems to give a [family blog] about that genocide they’ve all been facilitating. Last I checked murdering tens of thousands of women and children was frowned upon by the law… FIGHTING to get us ACCESS! Gotta keep their powder dry for the Political DDAY! The democrat list for 2025 looks like they want a president Vance. Also just read a Tweet from team D that Orange Hitler has spent 30% of his presidency playing golf. Giggle. So he has done so much his first week they can’t get a grip on what to be outraged about, yet he spent too much time playing golf. Crazy times we live in. Did they factor in the time spent on that Colombia President mulligan? ;) It really is not a good look at all for AOC, et al. All over twitter yesterday about how expensive coffee and cut flowers were going to be very soon. That was their priority. Meanwhile, and so far, all the attention rounding up these illegals seems to be on the criminals, etc. I would make a rational assumption that the planes to Colombia are pretty much those kind of immigrants. In other words, exactly who needs to be sent home. And by so doing – protecting the kids and families of America who should not be forced to live next to pimps, drug runners and criminals. My patient family today who brought in their grandma were just effusively singing the praises of Donald Trump. “He understood these bad people need to go home” and “he cares about our safety”. etc. Ummm, AOC – the coffee and flowers routine is not working on these people. Of course coffee and daily Starbucks hits are much more important issues to your constituency. It will be really entertaining when it is Mexico’s turn….Oh me oh my, what are we ever going to do without our avocado toast? Better luck next time. Not to mention is the entire flower issue is predicated on the fact that the entire industry was moved to Colombia by NAFTA neoliberals, leaving all of those American workers behind to learn how to code and leaving boarded up greenhouses – STILL THERE – saw it this summer – in their wake. The other thought going through my head last night…….There must be a couple hundred very bad people on that plane that the President of Colombia would risk a trade war to keep them out. This is going to be a very interesting four years. This is going to be a very long four years for the AOC crowd if this absolutely pitiful response is going to be the best they can do. One thing that the “rights people” do that’s offensive to those whom they think they are currying favor with is that they go out of way defending various dubious people who happen to be members of a certain group, as if they are being persecuted because they belong to that group, while ignoring the bit about their being dubious (e.g. criminals etc.) They feed the preconception (which, perhaps, they themelves hold, that members of that group are predisposed to criminality, say (and, worse, “can’t help themselves,” because of culture or whatever.) In other words, attempts at playing “culturism” winds up being pretty much a perpetuation of racism (possibly, that, their own racism.) Having been on the other end often enough (allegedly positive “model minority” stereotypes and variations of thinly disguised “yellow peril” ones), I’ve found this tendency profoundly offensive a bit too often. This makes a deal of sense. The NGOs claiming to rescue the victims must insist the victims are always and immutably victims. There is no out or up or escape into better lives for the victims, only the ministrations of the NGOs can make the victims lives better, the NGOs may claim. The NGOs may do good work at one level but terrible blocking at another level. I am amazed that people, especially intelligent people who should know better, eat up the propaganda stunt of the denied deportation flight. Look at how I’m going to stare down the government of any country on earth: 1. arrange a flight that doesn’t follow normal protocols (shackling deportees), using military planes (do you want other countries to fly their military planes into the US without getting permission first??) 2. say nasty things when flight gets rejected 3. arrange a more normal flight the next day 4. declare victory when it gets accepted Also, if he’s really going to do mass deportations, where is he going to get all the planes? Why isn’t anyone talking about ships yet? (Hint: he’s not really serious about the mass deportations.) They say their target is 1200-1500 people per day. That is at most less that 2.2 million people over Trump’s entire term. My understanding is that 2 million illegal migrants came every year during Biden’s term. So they’d need to increase the rate four-fold to return the number of illegal migrants at the end of Trump’s first term. There were supposedly 12 million illegal migrants in the US at the end of Trump’s first term, and if an additional 8 million arrived, there would be 20 million of them. That would mean each one has a 1/10=10% chance of being deported. Immigration crackdowns, deportations [▲]; I don’t see why we should expect that to cause inflation, particularly if those who are deported have been convicted of engaging in activities that reduce productivity (crimes such as theft, procuring drugs, making places unsafe, etc). It’s not as if Biden’s term, during which the number of illegal migrants increased by 8 million, is known for reducing inflation. All over twitter yesterday about how expensive coffee and cut flowers were going to be very soon. That was their priority. I guess the one million homeless Americans, the threats to the food supply, not to mention the price of it, and various other things are not important? If I couldn’t afford coffee, I would just buy tea, as much as I have started with coffee most every morning for forty years. Really, the arguments from the Democratic Party and its supporters are getting more unserious by the day. very good IM DOC, lets remind all what NAFTA stands for, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement North American Free Trade Agreement it was sold to us by neo-liberal weasels in the economic professions, politicians, media shills as free trade, because it is free trade for a few. now they say there is no such thing as free trade, after its imploded. under free trade, government no longer has sovereignty and democratic control. government is now subservient to capital, they now are the enforcers of free trade for capital. https://fpif.org/free-trade-regime-oligarchy-action/ “Let’s put this assertion to the test by looking at the concrete example of free trade agreements and their relation to democracy and national sovereignty. “Democracy” typically refers to a system of government in which people decide on the rules of their sovereign nation. In the true spirit of democracy and sovereignty, all spheres of policy — including the environment, trade, finance, intellectual property, and culture — must be subject to a fair political process and self-determination. In the modern, globalized world, the institutions of democracy and sovereignty exist in tension with another powerful institution: the global market and its free trade regimes.” “While a small number of labor unions and NGOs appear to have some involvement in the process, critics note that many relevant actors have been shut out. As renowned economists Joseph Stiglitz and Dean Baker contend, it is mostly the executive branch and some privileged big corporations that are involved in the process, and are therefore able to shape the treaty to fit their narrow interests.” Pretty sure we’ll have winged piglet passenger service between Davenport and Muscatine before any of those 12 losers get elected President. (Mayo Pete 😂 ) Not surprised that WaPo completely overlooked the one Democrat with the political assets or strengths to be a credible challenger in ’28.

People who nap in my culture are considers sick or strange. But our nights in the winter are so long that we sleep longer at night in the winter and less in the summer. Maybe it is not so much the the siesta is good for all of us, but good for those living in lower latitudes. Or maybe we are all so disconnected from nature that we cannot even feel the natural rhythms anymore, and maybe those with insomnia are just much more sensitive. If you are interested, here are some historical photographs of the Sami. REM sleep, the hard way. Prostate brachytherapy, with multiple waking periods per night.

The idea of a straight through eight hour sleep is relatively new apparently. Time was when it was custom to go to sleep for a coupla hours, get up for a while – and maybe even go for a walk – and then go to sleep for several hours more. It was our move into an industrial society that broke this sleep pattern- https://www.thecut.com/2017/03/sleeping-through-the-night-is-a-relatively-new-invention.html Time was, not even so very long ago, relatively speaking, when hominins had to get up to tend the fire. I’m sure that King David had others to tend the fire for him. But he still got up at midnight, as Psalm 119:62 shows. If Politico is quoting Amy Klobuchar, my money’s on Ken Martin. In so very many ways he’s the worst possible choice and therefore irrestistable to the double-downers in the DNC. Same link also quotes Slotkin (MI) trash talking Tulsi Gabbard with one-sided anecdotes and a completely unattributed allegation that Gabbard is not very intelligent, leading me to think that CIA embeds aren’t as smart as we’ve been led to believe. Is it out of bounds to say that Tulsi Gabbard scares the crap out CIA and the other 15 to 20 intelligence agencies and their fan girls and fan boys in Congress.She has been on the right side of the issues of which I am aware. They have either been wrong, “misinformed” or flat out spinning yarns to keep the cash flowing in all the right directions. It has reached the point that if the DC Bubble and Echo Chamber says something, I assume it is at best distorted and often flatly false. Tulsi might let a bit of light into that dark and fetid room that is DC.

Good data as usual. New Patrick Lawrence takes a glass half full look at the Trump liftoff and even ventures some explanations. Many of the big-name philosophers of the past 100 years — Husserl, Heidegger, Lévinas, et al. — shared a pronounced preoccupation beginning in the 1920s. I relate this (and the scholars may correct me) to the wreckage of the First World War they found all around them. These were the explorers and developers of the discipline called phenomenology. Who are we? What has become of us, we who dwell in mass, mechanized societies? What is the nature of human relationships? These were among the questions. Emmanuel Lévinas, a Lithuanian Jew who lived in France (1906–1995) and wrote in French, elevated these matters to an enduring discourse concerning the Self and the Other. Indifference to others, he argued — and how radically must I simplify — lay at the root of the 20th century’s ills and evils. The cult of the individual, he posited (among a lot of other things) must be transcended in favor of relationships with all the Others among us. We realize who we are only by way of these relationships; they are primary. “The Self is possible only through the recognition of the Other,” he wrote, a noted line. So, to continue my simplification: We are social beings first; our individuality derives from our sociality. Lévinas published Totality and Infinity, the book wherein he stated his case most fully and famously, in 1961. […] Americans are not well-advantaged in these matters, to put the point mildly. We long ago turned our insistence in our individuality into the “ism” of individualism, an ideology that, however far it has taken America in the past, now proves a ball and chain at our ankles. Equally, America has had such power since the 1945 victories that its policy cliques long ago lost interest in the perspectives of others—how the world looks to them, their aspirations, their histories, all the rest. This is why, with admirable but few exceptions, America produces such poor diplomats. It has had no need of them. And the policy cliques in Washington have not yet registered that we have in consequence already begun to fail. https://scheerpost.com/2025/01/27/patrick-lawrence-trumps-failures-americas-failures/ He’s saying the American cult of individualism also accounts for Trump’s pronouncements about the countries he wants to take over or the map points to be renamed. It’s a bit of megalomania to be sure but also the provincialism of someone who doesn’t worry much about how others might see these ideas. And for that reason he’s saying it’s very unlikely that most of them will come to pass including, one hopes, his recent statements about the Middle East. By contrast the Bidenistas’ fantasies were serious as a heart attack. One might well claim that in that instance the America above all others view morphed into sociopathy. Thanks for your comment. One argument I’ve read about T touting a north-south US empire vs an east-west empire is that the neocon dream of an east-west empire has hit a stopping point. Whereas, in comparison, a north-south empire can still be achieved in some fashion, and would also undercut the neocon east-west dreams, if one wanted to undercut the neocon dreams. Not a bad argument, imo. Reminds me of Cheneys quip about creating their own reality and everyone else just having to go with it. ” Thinking ChatGPT is useless is midwit” . . . is midwit. Nate Silver has outed himself. Perhaps he always was an idiot-savant, or at least a moron-genius.

I’m so happy to see both Nate and Matty getting righteously dunked on, and for the same reasons. Perhaps there is hope after all. Natty and Mate, lost on an island they can see across– Mate – I see water Natty – This is more complicated that it looks! . . . ” Absolutely wild statistic. There really are 2 Americas. And not a single politician, public figure, or business leader is in this bottom 75th percentile group: ” . . .

( Because joining such a party would be a tacit admission that one is Lower Class). We! Are! the Seventy-Five Per Cent! How many of this bottom 75% would be ready to form or join a party called the New Deal America Party? ( That would take millions of person-hours at teach-ins all over the country to explain to Americans below a certain age what the “New Deal” even was. Only then could people decide about joining such a thing or not. I think it would be worth doing, though. Maybe it could be taught about in that nationwide network of Reading Rooms which no successor to OWS has yet been able to organize and fund itself to the point of being able to create). America needs a better Two Party System. A better Two Parties for a better Two Party System. A Lower Class Majority Party and a Make America New Deal Party, and they could spend a couple of decades in political cage-match fighting and Darwin could decide which is the better Party. The New Deal teach-ins should emphasize the Second Bill of Rights proposed by FDR. They are never mentioned in the MSM: – The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the Nation; – The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation; – The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living; – The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad; – The right of every family to a decent home; – The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health; – The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment; – The right to a good education. https://billofrightsinstitute.org/activities/franklin-roosevelt-second-bill-of-rights-1944 Here is a picture titled : The UC Davis pepper spray incident that the university paid over $100,000 to ‘erase from the internet’. ” And here it is, back on the internet. https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1ibcewz/the_uc_davis_pepper_spray_incident_that_the/ Spirit of Saint Luigi.

Re: Trump Just Broke the Law From time to time, I end up in discussions on Facebook and I just so happened to come across a discussion regarding this. What Tomasky curiously omits in his piece is that incoming Administrations aren’t affected by the rule stating that you need 30 days of notice to remove an Inspector General. I really hope this isn’t “we’re out of strategies, just do lawfare all over again!” like the first term was. If so, we are in for a long four years. > is.

ATW Livestream Tonight at 8 PM ET/7 PM CT https://www.racket.news/p/atw-livestream-tonight-at-8-pm-et7-1a5 I’ve been watching Tucker Carlson’s lengthy interview with Matt. Good to see Matt in that platform, though sad to see him pushing the idea that masks were unnecessary and their use was instituted as a way of “inducing social conformity”. He seems to be a big Battacharya fan. Matt did say that inducing social conformity might well have been a motive and, as I understood it, after the fact. I do not recall him saying masks were per se unnecessary. Yes, sad indeed, much as I enjoy Matt’s commentary on many things. He falls into a special category of writers who are usually so spot on, that when they go off into the deep end it is so absurdly wacky and obvious that I’m prepared to cut him more slack that I would for someone of lesser talents. And yet, do we throw out the baby with the bath water? Or do we do our own research (horrors!) and come to our own conclusions? Taking Taibbi and many others into account? The US’s ye olde health authorities having fallen into disrepute, I’ll read widely and come to my own conclusions. Gasp! From How the Messy Process of Milking Cows Can Spread Bird Flu It takes seven hours for the farm to milk all 1,050 cows. Then, the workers spend an hour cleaning, which includes washing out the milking equipment with detergent and hot water. After that, the next eight-hour shift begins, and all the cows are milked again. It’s hard to believe this doesn’t milk the cows to death. Like a war, this runs 24/7. My family’s dairy farm used to milk the cows twice per day, about 10-11 hours apart, so the schedule from the link isn’t that drastic. Also, dairy cows are “dried off” (not milked at all) for several weeks per year. I’m sure though that your average cow in an industrial herd has a shorter lifespan than one on a small farm that sends most of her day out in the field. That sounds right and on an industrial milk factory as described it would take hours to clean the equipment. If the cows are milked in the same order the milkings would be 10 to 11, maybe 12 hours apart. re: Gallery Wonderful and hilarious Chas Addams cartoon to think most readers identified with and got a laugh from the Addams Family cartoons.

Around 44 million cubic metres/110 million tonnes (120 million short tons) of limestone rock slid down Turtle Mountain. Witnesses reported that within 100 seconds the rock reached up the opposing hills, obliterating the eastern edge of Frank, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) line and the coal mine. It was one of the largest landslides in Canadian history and remains the deadliest, as between 70 and 90 of the town’s residents died, most of whom remain buried in the rubble. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Slide It’s quite an exciting start to the New Year, LA Fires, DeepSeek deep sixing Open AI, Trump tossing shit bombs in every direction and best of all I haven’t heard a cackle from Harris..

I came to the conclusion that Japan is governed by customs, unlike the US which is governed by laws. Yet, if we denigrate both norms and lawsuits, what recourse remains? Heraclitus (fragment 249): “The people must fight on behalf of the law as though for the city wall.” Abraham Lincoln (in “The Perpetuation of Our Political Institutions.”): “As the patriots of seventy-six did to the support of the Declaration of Independence, so to the support of the Constitution and Laws, let every American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred honor…. Let reverence for the laws…become the political religion of the nation; and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor, the grave and the gay, of all sexes and tongues, and colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly upon its altars.” Law is the ultimate propaganda. I think not in the US. Else why would Davos fellow the American John Kerry claim the US Constitution’s !st Amendment regarding freedom of speech a difficultly and an impediment for “their right to rule”? Where said “their right” is an entirely undemocratic and shadowy body? Japan has extremely well-shared and well-enforced norms, something absent in the US. So less friction. Hence the recourse in the US to lawsuits (or as some would have it, to lawfare). Property, liberty, and wardship compose authority, first in the solitary individual, then in the family, and finally in the state. (At the state level, wardship consists of all laws, magistracies, judiciary, arms, fortifications, wars, and treaties.) Civil authority, comprised of all three, is political sovereignty, but from what shall this authority derive its justification? Authority is related to certitude as reason is related to truth. Truth is the object of divine reason–Only god knows the Truth; certitude is all that belongs to man. This certitude depends not on reason but on authority–the authority of our senses or of our informants or of those who have enacted the laws which we receive as determinant or certain. Certitude is a partial knowledge. Certitude is subjective. Certitude is empirical, dependent on experience or tradition, and not on reason. Hence, progress in history and politics consists in the gradual assimilation of authority to reason. In theory, anyway. The true ‘Red Flag’ in that Resume Now list is the fact that 3 in 10 report having taken out debt to pay living expenses. The more immiserated people become, the more desperate they become, the more angry they become. We are thus seeing first-hand the creation of a revolutionary mass. As people become increasingly “homeless,” Power truly will be out in the street waiting to be picked up. What the American Democrat Party needs now is an American Lenin to force them into action. Re: “Scoop: How Trump’s ‘black box’ limits outside influences” “It’s a total black box,” a lobbyist close to the administration told Axios. “Nothing is leaking except what they want.” There’s a “strong silo system” that has kept advocates and special interests from forum-shopping and end-running administration officials, the lobbyist added. So… “forum-shopping and end-running administration officials” means either the way things worked in the Trump 1.0 admin, or else it means this has just been the standard operating procedure for DC lobbyists under any recent admin (given time, tho, I’m sure the lobbyists will figure it out). On this subject, if anybody can suggest a good article or book on how lobbyists and lobbying work in DC, I’d be grateful to hear. Is this “news story” real? Or is it satire?

Title: Chinese AI Startup DeepSeek Shakes up Silicon Valley, Wall Street
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/artificial-intelligence-2/2025/chinese-ai-startup-deepseek-shakes-up-silicon-valley-wall-street/
Time Published: 2025-01-27T18:56:54Z
Full Content:
Shares of Nvidia, the darling stock of the generative AI boom, are down 15.3% in midday trading on Monday (Jan. 27) as Wall Street grapples with the revelation that it could be overpaying for this emerging technology. Google, Microsoft and Amazon shares are also down. The culprit: Chinese AI startup DeepSeek’s artificial intelligence (AI) models that perform on par with OpenAI’s and Google’s top models but at a fraction of the cost and with far fewer of Nvidia’s GPUs. DeepSeek was founded by Liang Wenfeng, who also co-founded a quantitative hedge fund in China called High-Flyer. DeepSeek has released a family of models: V3 (AI chat) and R1 (reasoning models). The startup said R1 had cost $5.58 million and used 2,048 of Nvidia’s H800 chips to train, according to a paper published by its researchers. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has said that AI models currently cost $100 million to train, but it could hit $100 billion. AI executives have also said training would need thousands of AI chips, principally those made by Nvidia. The sell-off comes as OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle and MGX announced a project called Stargate last week that plans to spend $100 billion to half a trillion dollars to build AI infrastructure, mainly data centers. Those and other AI cost estimates are now in question. Shares of Microsoft were down 3.7%, Google fell 3% and Amazon gave up about 1%. “Artificial intelligence has reached a critical inflection point. The industry stands at a crossroads where escalating costs, environmental concerns, and innovation appear intertwined, threatening to stifle accessibility and adoption,” Gokul Naidu, a consultant for SAP, told PYMNTS. “Enter DeepSeek-R1, the model that’s turning heads in Silicon Valley and beyond for proving that high performance and affordability aren’t mutually exclusive.” “DeepSeek challenges the narrative that innovation must come at an unsustainable cost,” Naidu said. “For businesses, this means AI could soon be accessible to small and medium enterprises, not just tech giants with deep pockets.” DeepSeek could “catalyze a shift in Silicon Valley’s approach to AI,” Naidu said. “Historically, the tech epicenter has prioritized growth at all costs, often ignoring questions of efficiency. But DeepSeek forces a recalibration. With its dramatically lower cost structure, businesses and developers alike are reevaluating their priorities, focusing on efficiency-driven growth.” DeepSeek is now the most downloaded app in the Apple App Store. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman pushed back in a post on X last month, when DeepSeek V3 first came out, saying, “It is (relatively) easy to copy something that you know works. it is extremely hard to do something new, risky, and difficult when you don’t know if it will work. individual researchers rightly get a lot of glory for that when they do it! it’s the coolest thing in the world.” DeepSeek also reportedly is subject to Chinese censorship, refusing to answer questions about Taiwan, for example. (Developers can get around this by revising the open-source models.) Marc Andreessen, from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, posted on X that “DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen — and as open source, a profound gift to the world.” Naidu said DeepSeek’s open-source strategy “further amplifies its impact. OpenAI’s proprietary approach, while effective, limits transparency and collaboration. By contrast, DeepSeek invites developers worldwide to contribute, experiment, and build on its platform. This open-source ethos democratizes AI capabilities, fostering a more inclusive innovative ecosystem.” Meta Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun said in a post on LinkedIn that people concerned that China is overtaking the U.S. in AI are misreading DeepSeek’s impact. “The correct reading is: Open source models are surpassing proprietary ones. DeepSeek has profited from open research and open source. … They came up with new ideas and built them on top of other people’s work. Because their work is published and open source, everyone can profit from it. That is the power of open research and open source.” Meta, whose strategy was to distribute open-source AI models, saw its shares up 1%. With open source, any developer can download and fine-tune, or retrain to customize, their AI models. However, developers typically still have to pay fees to access the model through APIs. While Meta doesn’t charge to access its API, DeepSeek does. But Naidu said DeepSeek is also deeply discounted here: “DeepSeek charges $0.55 per million tokens, compared to OpenAI’s o1 model, which demands $15 per million tokens. For businesses wary of runaway operational bills, this is a game-changer.” Many developers build their own AI applications atop the foundation models from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic and others. To access and use these models, such as inputting prompts and getting responses, developers have to pay AI pricing based on token volume. (A thousand tokens translates to roughly 750 words.) Naidu also pointed out that DeepSeek was also able to get around President Joe Biden’s export controls on advanced AI chips, which he recently expanded to carve out different levels of access for more than 120 countries. “DeepSeek’s achievement is particularly impressive given its constraints,” Naidu said. “As a Chinese company facing export restrictions, it was unable to access the latest Nvidia GPUs, such as the H200, and instead relied on older H800 GPUs. Yet, the R1 model still managed to rival — or, in some tests, outperform — more expensive counterparts.” “This feat speaks volumes about the ingenuity behind DeepSeek’s approach. It’s not just about throwing money at the problem; it’s about finding smarter, leaner ways to train and deploy AI systems,” Naidu added. Naidu cited the following ripple effects from DeepSeek: “DeepSeek is more than a model — it’s a wake-up call for the entire AI industry,” Naidu said. “It challenges entrenched assumptions about the cost of innovation and offers a path forward where cutting-edge technology is both affordable and sustainable. As we move deeper into 2025, the conversation around AI is no longer just about power — it’s about power at the right price. “And in this race, DeepSeek might just have redefined the finish line.” We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: What to Know About DeepSeek, the Chinese AI Company Causing Stock Market Chaos

A new Chinese AI model, created by the Hangzhou-based startup DeepSeek, has stunned the American AI industry by outperforming some of OpenAI’s leading models, displacing ChatGPT at the top of the iOS app store, and usurping Meta as the leading purveyor of so-called open source AI tools. All of which has raised a critical question: despite American sanctions on Beijing’s ability to access advanced semiconductors, is China catching up with the U.S. in the global AI race? At a supposed cost of just $6 million to train, DeepSeek’s new R1 model, released last week, was able to match the performance on several math and reasoning metrics by OpenAI’s o1 model – the outcome of tens of billions of dollars in investment by OpenAI and its patron Microsoft. The Chinese model is also cheaper for users. Access to its most powerful versions costs some 95% less than OpenAI and its competitors. The upshot: the U.S. tech industry is suddenly faced with a potentially cheaper and more powerful challenger, unnerving investors, who sold off American tech stocks on Monday morning. Yet not everyone is convinced. Some American AI researchers have cast doubt on DeepSeek’s claims about how much it spent, and how many advanced chips it deployed to create its model. Few, however, dispute DeepSeek’s stunning capabilities. “Deepseek R1 is AI's Sputnik moment,” wrote prominent American venture capitalist Marc Andreessen on X, referring to the moment in the Cold War when the Soviet Union managed to put a satellite in orbit ahead of the United States. So, what is DeepSeek and what could it mean for U.S. tech supremacy? DeepSeek was founded less than two years ago by the Chinese hedge fund High Flyer as a research lab dedicated to pursuing Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI. A spate of open source releases in late 2024 put the startup on the map, including the large language model “v3”, which outperformed all of Meta's open-source LLMs and rivaled OpenAI's closed-source GPT4-o. At the time, Liang Wenfeng, the CEO, reportedly said that he had hired young computer science researchers with a pitch to “solve the hardest questions in the world"—critically, without aiming for profits. Early signs were promising: his products were so efficient that DeepSeek’s 2024 releases sparked a price war within the Chinese AI industry, forcing competitors to slash prices. This year, that price war looks set to reach across the Pacific Ocean. Yet DeepSeek’s AI looks different from its U.S. competitors in one important way. Despite their high performance on reasoning tests, Deepseek’s models are constrained by China’s restrictive policies regarding criticism of the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP). DeepSeek R1 refuses to answer questions about the massacre at Tiananmen Square, Beijing, in 1989, for example. “Sorry, that's beyond my current scope. Let’s talk about something else,” the model said when queried by TIME. At a moment when Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and dozens of their competitors are preparing to spend further tens of billions of dollars on new AI infrastructure, DeepSeek’s success has raised a troubling question: Could Chinese tech firms potentially match, or even surpass, their technical prowess while spending significantly less? Meta, which plans to spend $65 billion on AI infrastructure this year, has already set up four “war rooms” to analyze DeepSeek’s models, seeking to find out how the Chinese firm had managed to train a model so cheaply and use the insights to improve its own open source Llama models, tech news site The Information reported over the weekend. In the financial markets, Nvidia’s stock price dipped more than 15% on Monday morning on fears that fewer AI chips may be necessary to train powerful AI than previously thought. Other American tech stocks were also trading lower. “While [DeepSeek R1] is good news for users and the global economy, it is bad news for U.S. tech stocks,” says Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management. “It may result in a nominal downsizing of capital investment in AI and pressure on margins, at a time when valuation and growth expectations are very stretched.” But American tech hasn’t lost—at least not yet. For now, OpenAI’s “o1 Pro” model is still considered the most advanced in the world. The performance of DeepSeek R1, however, does suggest that China is much closer to the frontier of AI than previously thought, and that open-source models have just about caught up to their closed-source counterparts. Perhaps even more worrying for companies like OpenAI and Google, whose models are closed source, is how much—or rather, how little—DeepSeek is charging consumers to access its most advanced models. OpenAI charges $60 per million “tokens”, or segments of words, outputted by its most advanced model, o1. By contrast DeepSeek charges $2.19 for the same number of tokens from R1—nearly 30 times less. “It erodes the industrial base, it erodes the margin, it erodes the incentive for further capital investment into western [AI] scaling from private sources,” says Edouard Harris, the chief technology officer of Gladstone AI, an AI firm that works closely with the U.S. government. DeepSeek’s success was all the more explosive because it seemed to call into question the effectiveness of the U.S. government’s strategy to constrain China’s AI ecosystem by restricting the export of powerful chips, or GPUs, to Beijing. If DeepSeek’s claims are accurate, it means China has the ability to create powerful AI models despite those restrictions, underlining the limits of the U.S. strategy. DeepSeek has claimed it is constrained by access to chips, not cash or talent, saying it trained its models v3 and R1 using just 2,000 second-tier Nvidia chips. “Money has never been the problem for us,” DeepSeek’s CEO, Liang Wenfeng, said in 2024. “Bans on shipments of advanced chips are the problem.” (Current U.S. policy makes it illegal to export to China the most advanced types of AI chips, the likes of which populate U.S. datacenters used by OpenAI and Microsoft.) But are those claims true? “My understanding is DeepSeek has 50,000 H100s,” Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang recently told CNBC in Davos, referring to the highest-powered Nvidia GPU chips currently on the market. “They can’t talk about [them], because it is against the export controls that the U.S. has put in place.” (An H100 cluster of that size would cost in the region of billions of dollars.) In a sign of how seriously the CCP is taking the technology, Liang, Deepseek’s CEO, met with China’s premier Li Qiang in Beijing last Monday. In that meeting, Liang reportedly told Li that DeepSeek needs more chips. “DeepSeek only has access to a few thousand GPUs, and yet they’re pulling this off,” says Jeremie Harris, CEO of Gladstone AI. “So this raises the obvious question: what happens when they get an allocation from the Chinese Communist Party to proceed at full speed?” Even though China might have achieved a startling level of AI capability with fewer chips, experts say more computing power will always remain a strategic advantage. On that front, the U.S. remains far ahead. “It's never a bad thing to have more of it,” says Dean Ball, a research fellow at George Mason University. “No matter how much you have of it, you will always use it.” The short answer: from Washington’s perspective, in uncertain waters. In the closing days of the Biden Administration, outgoing National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan warned that the speed of AI advancement was “the most consequential thing happening in the world right now.” And just days into his new job, President Trump announced a new $500 billion venture, backed by OpenAI and others, to build the infrastructure vital for the creation of “artificial general intelligence”— the next leap forward in AI, with systems advanced enough to make new scientific breakthroughs and reason in ways that have so far remained in the realm of science fiction. Read More: What to Know About ‘Stargate,’ OpenAI’s New Venture Announced by President Trump And although questions remain about the future of U.S. chip restrictions on China, Washington’s priorities were apparent in President Trump’s AI executive order, also signed during his first week in office, which declared that “it is the policy of the United States to sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance in order to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security.” Maintaining this dominance will mean, at least in part, understanding exactly what Chinese tech firms are doing—as well as protecting U.S. intellectual property, experts say. “There's a good chance that DeepSeek and many of the other big Chinese companies are being supported by the [Chinese] government, in more than just a monetary way,” says Edouard Harris of Gladstone AI, who also recommended that U.S. AI companies harden their security measures. Since December, OpenAI’s new o1 and o3 models have smashed records on advanced reasoning tests designed to be difficult for AI models to pass. Read More: AI Models Are Getting Smarter. New Tests Are Racing to Catch Up DeepSeek R1 does something similar, and in the process exemplifies what many researchers say is a paradigm shift: instead of scaling the amount of computing power used to train the model, researchers scale the amount of time (and thus, computing power and electricity) the model uses to think about a response to a query before answering. It is this scaling of what researchers call “test-time compute” that distinguishes the new class of “reasoning models,” such as DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI’s o1, from their less sophisticated predecessors. Many AI researchers believe there’s plenty of headroom left before this paradigm hits its limit. Some AI researchers hailed DeepSeek’s R1 as a breakthrough on the same level as DeepMind’s AlphaZero, a 2017 model that became superhuman at the board games Chess and Go by purely playing against itself and improving, rather than observing any human games. That’s because R1 wasn’t “pretrained” on human-labeled data in the same way as other leading LLMs. Instead, DeepSeek’s researchers found a way to allow the model to bootstrap its own reasoning capabilities essentially from scratch. “Rather than explicitly teaching the model on how to solve a problem, we simply provide it with the right incentives, and it autonomously develops advanced problem-solving strategies,” they claim. The finding is significant because it suggests that powerful AI capabilities might emerge more rapidly and with less human effort than previously thought, with just the application of more computing power. “DeepSeek R1 is like GPT-1 of this scaling paradigm,” says Ball. Ultimately, China’s recent AI progress, instead of usurping U.S. strength, might in fact be the beginning of a reordering—a step, in other words, toward a future where, instead of a hegemonic power, there are many competing centers of AI power. “China will still have their own superintelligence(s) no more than a year later than the US, absent [for example] a war,” wrote Miles Brundage, a former OpenAI policy staffer, on X. “So unless you want (literal) war, you need to have a vision for navigating multipolar AI outcomes.” Write to Billy Perrigo at billy.perrigo@time.com

Title: The AI-stock wipeout lays bare 2 risks investors have been happy to ignore — until now

Time Published: 2025-01-27T18:06:33Z

A new artificial intelligence tool from a startup in China has sent shockwaves across the US tech sector, with the cheaper AI model trained on older chips forcing investors to confront two big risks to the market. DeepSeek joined the AI race in recent days, sparking a big sell-off to start the week as investors faced concerns about risks that had largely been glossed over while the bull rally continued for the last two years — namely, risks associated with stretched tech-stock valuations and enormous spending by some of the biggest tech firms as they pursue their AI ambitions. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 fell sharply Monday morning, down 1.8% and 3.2% around noon ET. Semiconductor stocks faced the steepest losses, while tech giants including Microsoft and Alphabet also dropped. The debut of the DeepSeek AI tool blindsided investors who have been willing to accept the tech sector's historically stretched valuations as justified since the bull market took off in 2022. The new AI app is also likely forcing tough questions about AI spending by the cloud "hyperscalers" that have pursued ambitious AI programs in the last few years. Overnight, it's become much harder to shrug off two big risks to the stock market's dominant narrative. Chatter about a possible correction has risen, but has still mostly been confined to the fringes of Wall Street's consensus views. The market has predicted another strong year for stocks, even after the S&P 500 hit more than 50 records in 2024 and posted a second year of 25% gains. With help from the AI investing frenzy, the Magnificent Seven stocks — Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Apple, and Tesla — have surged, and account for over a third of the value of the S&P 500. Writing in a note earlier this month, Bank of America analysts said that of the 20 valuation metrics they track, 19 were sitting at extreme levels. The S&P 500's trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 25.3 times, for example, is 70% above its 125-year average of about 15 times. Valuation metrics like that have been easy to accept while the market's biggest stocks faced little outside competition and could woo investors with promises of the transformative power of new technology. But DeepSeek is now laying bare the danger that the US market has been overvalued. As its AI tool undercuts OpenAI on pricing, outperforms leading US peers, and is being trained on older and cheaper Nvidia GPUs, tech valuations are in doubt. That's evident in the plunge in the price of Nvidia stock on Monday. The chip titan, which reclaimed the title of the world's most valuable company from Apple last week, dropped as much as 18% and was headed for a loss that would mark the worst market-cap wipeout in history. Broadcom fell more than 17% and Taiwan Semiconductor Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was down more than 14% at midday. "What makes Monday's tech selloff so jarring is that the valuations of many of these AI and tech companies offer no margin of error," David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at The Bahnsen Group, said in written commentary. "Excessive valuation always becomes a problem, eventually, but fundamental news becomes a heightened problem when it is combined with excessive valuation." The tech meltdown could also lead to a painful reckoning among investors over high spending among the "hyperscalers" — companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms — that have poured billions of dollars into AI to further build out cloud computing capabilities. Morgan Stanley estimated at the end of last year that Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft would collectively see $300 billion in AI capital expenditures through 2025, with even bigger figures to come in 2026. Before that, Bernstein projected that Big Tech capex on data centers and real estate would exceed $1 trillion over five years. Microsoft alone said it would spend $80 billion this year on AI data centers. "These high and rising capex numbers again speak to the importance of continued disclosure about new/incremental adoption, engagement, and revenue opportunities each of the four companies are seeing and investing in," Morgan Stanley analysts wrote last November. Investors had been getting somewhat anxious to start seeing a return on this spending, but have largely still been willing to tolerate it as long as earnings growth continued. Bullish analysts had argued that heavy spending was required to fuel a profitable AI boom over the next decade. However, DeepSeek is challenging this view. For one, the AI tool is trained on cheaper Nvidia H800 chips, as the US government has restricted the sale of some of the company's most advanced GPUs to China. The fact that a cutting-edge AI app has been developed with last-gen tech may damage the thesis that companies need to spend more and more on high-powered GPUs to keep up. This has sparked some discussions about future demand for Nvidia's more expensive hardware. "While there is a contention that DeepSeek's efficient training methods could reduce the demand for high-end Nvidia GPUs, potentially affecting sales, it is also plausible that the more cost-effective approach will result in more demand for hardware for those looking to train proprietary models," wrote Mark Klein, CEO of SuRo Capital. While the market's tech panic has revived dormant issues concerning valuations and spending, Bernstein analysts said on Monday that the reaction may be overblown. Analysts at Jefferies, meanwhile, suggested reduced exposure to semiconductor supply chains while the impact becomes more clear. Investors are also bracing for tech earnings to begin this week, and DeepSeek has raised the stakes for mega-cap results. While strong Big Tech earnings have been a catalyst for fresh gains, DeepSeek could spoil the party this time. "We do not expect big tech earnings over the next two weeks to help justify the sector's elevated valuations. These companies may very well report a wonderful quarter, and they may guide higher for intended orders and revenue expectations. Current valuations do not factor in the risks of competition, which seems inevitable, and risks of diminished order books in the future, and all the other reasons that lofty valuations eventually revert to the mean," he wrote. Importantly, the broader stock market's fate in 2025 might hinge on the performance of the Magnificent Seven. At the end of last year, Bank of America said that the elite group must keep winning to avoid spurring a wider market correction. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks

Shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and a slew of other stocks related to AI sold off Monday as an app from Chinese AI startup DeepSeek boomed in popularity. DeepSeek's AI assistant recently topped the list of free iPhone apps on Apple's (AAPL) app store. (It wasn't in the top 10 on Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Play store, though it is listed there.) In Apple's store, the app ranked higher than ChatGPT; not so on Google. Here’s what you need to know about DeepSeek—and why it’s having a big impact on markets. And if you're wondering if it wasn't that long ago that another Chinese app was topping the download charts, you're not wrong. DeepSeek, a Chinese startup founded by hedge fund manager Liang Wenfeng, was founded in 2023 in Hangzhou, China, the tech hub home to Alibaba (BABA) and many of China’s other high-flying tech giants. The company says its latest R1 AI model released last week offers performance that is on par with that of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Its V3 base model launched in December was also reportedly developed in just two months for under $6 million, at a time when the U.S. is limiting China's access to its most sophisticated chips and American AI leaders like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta Platforms (META) are spending billions of dollars on development. The rapid ascension of DeepSeek has investors worried it could threaten assumptions about how much competitive AI models cost to develop, as well as the kind of infrastructure needed to support them, with wide-reaching implications for the AI marketplace and Big Tech shares. Nvidia in a statement called DeepSeek "an excellent AI advancement," calling it a "perfect example" of a concept known as test time scaling. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell more than 3% Monday as investors dragged a host of stocks with ties to AI, from chip to energy firms, downwards. Shares of American AI chipmakers including Nvidia, Broadcom (AVGO) and AMD (AMD) sold off, along with those of international partners like TSMC (TSM). The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) dropped more than 9%. Networking solutions and hardware partner stocks dropped along with them, including Dell (Dell), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Arista Networks (ANET). Some energy stocks were hit too. Shares of nuclear and other energy companies that saw their stocks boom in the last year in anticipation of an AI-driven boom in energy demand, such as Vistra (VST), Constellation Energy (CEG), Oklo (OKLO), and NuScale (SMR), also lost ground Monday. Meanwhile, some non-tech sectors like consumer staples rose Monday, marking a reconsideration of the market's momentum in recent months. Several analysts raised doubts about the longevity of the market’s reaction Monday, suggesting that the day's pullback could offer investors a chance to pick up AI names set for a rebound. Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon called the reaction “overblown” and maintained an “outperform” rating for Nvidia’s stock price. Citi analysts, who said they expect AI companies to continue buying its advanced chips, maintained a "buy" rating on Nvidia. Wedbush analysts, who voiced skepticism that any major U.S. companies would use a Chinese startup like DeepSeek to build their AI infrastructure, said “launching a competitive LLM model for consumer use cases is one thing… launching broader AI infrastructure is a whole other ballgame and nothing with DeepSeek makes us believe anything different.” Wedbush called Monday a “golden buying opportunity” to own shares in ChatGPT backer Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet, Palantir (PLTR), and other heavyweights of the American AI ecosystem that had come under pressure.

Title: DeepSeek's cheaper models and weaker chips call into question trillions in AI infrastructure spending

The bombshell that is China's DeepSeek model has set the AI ecosystem alight. The models are high-performing, relatively cheap, and compute-efficient, which has led many to posit that they pose an existential threat to American companies like OpenAI and Meta — and the trillions of dollars going into building, improving, and scaling US AI infrastructure. The price of DeepSeek's open-source model is competitive — 20 to 40 times cheaper to run than comparable models from OpenAI, Bernstein analysts said. But the potentially more nerve-racking element in the DeepSeek equation for US-built models is the relatively modest hardware stack used to build them. The DeepSeek-V3 model, which is most comparable to OpenAI's ChatGPT, was trained on a cluster of 2,048 Nvidia H800 GPUs, according to the technical report published by the company. H800s are the first version of the company's defeatured chip for the Chinese market. After the regulations were amended, the company made another defeatured chip, the H20 to comply with the changes. Though this may not always be the case, chips are the most substantial cost in the large language model training equation. Being forced to use less powerful, cheaper chips created a constraint that the DeepSeek team has ostensibly overcome. "Innovation under constraints takes genius," Sri Ambati, the CEO of the open-source AI platform H2O.ai, told Business Insider. Even on subpar hardware, training DeepSeek-V3 took less than two months, the company's report said. DeepSeek-V3 is small relative to its capabilities and has 671 billion parameters, while ChatGPT-4 has 1.76 trillion, which makes it easier to run. But DeepSeek-V3 still hits impressive benchmarks of understanding. Its smaller size comes in part by using a different architecture than ChatGPT, called a "mixture of experts." The model has pockets of expertise built in, which go into action when called upon and sit dormant when irrelevant to the query. This type of model is growing in popularity, and DeepSeek's advantage is that it built an extremely efficient version of an inherently efficient architecture. "Someone made this analogy: It's almost as if someone released a $20 iPhone," Jared Quincy Davis, the CEO of Foundry, told BI. The Chinese model used a fraction of the time, a fraction of the number of chips, and a less capable, less expensive chip cluster. Essentially, it's a drastically cheaper, competitively capable model that the firm is virtually giving away for free. Bernstein analysts said that DeepSeek-R1, a reasoning model more comparable to OpenAI's o1 or o3, is even more concerning from a competitive standpoint. This model uses reasoning techniques to interrogate its own responses and thinking, similar to OpenAI's latest reasoning models. R1 was built on top of V3, but the research paper released with the more advanced model doesn't include information about the hardware stack behind it. DeepSeek used strategies like generating its own training data to train R1, which requires more compute than using data scraped from the internet or generated by humans. This technique is often referred to as "distillation" and is becoming standard practice, Ambati said. Distillation brings with it another layer of controversy, though. A company using its own models to distill a smarter, smaller model is one thing. But the legality of using other company's models to distill new ones depends on licensing. Still, DeepSeek's techniques are more iterative and likely to be taken up by the AI indsutry immediately. For years, model developers and startups have focused on smaller models since their size makes them cheaper to build and operate. The thinking was that small models would serve specific tasks. But what DeepSeek and potentially OpenAI's o3 mini demonstrate is that small models can also be generalists. A coalition of players including Oracle and OpenAI, with cooperation from the White House, announced Stargate, a $500 billion data center project in Texas — the latest in a quick procession of developments in large-scale conversion to accelerated computing. DeepSeek's surprise release has called that investment into question, and Nvidia, the largest beneficiary of the investment, is on a roller coaster as a result. The company's stock plummeted more than 13% Monday. But Bernstein said the response is out of step with the reality. "DeepSeek DID NOT 'build OpenAI for $5M'," Bernstein analysts wrote in a Monday investor note. The panic, especially on X, is blown out of proportion, the analysts said. DeepSeek's own research paper on V3 says: "The aforementioned costs include only the official training of DeepSeek-V3, excluding the costs associated with prior research and ablation experiments on architectures, algorithms, or data." So the $5 million figure is only part of the equation. "The models look fantastic but we don't think they are miracles," Bernstein continued. Last week China also announced a roughly $140 billion investment in data centers, in a sign that infrastructure is still needed despite DeepSeek's achievements. The competition for model supremacy is fierce, and OpenAI's moat may indeed be in question. But demand for chips shows no signs of slowing, Bernstein said. Tech leaders are circling back to a centuries-old economic adage to explain the moment. The Jevons paradox is the idea that innovation begets demand. As technology gets cheaper or more efficient, demand increases much faster than prices drop. That's what providers of computing power, such as Foundry's Jared Quincy Davis, have been espousing for years. This week, Bernstein and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella picked up the mantle, too. "Jevons paradox strikes again!" Nadella posted on X Monday morning. "As AI gets more efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket, turning it into a commodity we just can't get enough of."

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 35 Most Important AI Stocks for 2025 According to JPMorgan. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) stands against the other AI stocks. Investors have become increasingly concerned about the rising capital expenditures on artificial intelligence, with many wondering whether the expectations embedded in financial markets today project a realistic path ahead. According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega-cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now makes up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and has driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on a 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes. JPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. Hardware firms were defined as the companies that drive the design and manufacture of the semiconductors that are key to generating computing power. Hyperscalers were picked out as the companies that provide physical AI infrastructure such as cloud services and data centers, create custom silicon chips, and build large language models that can be used by other companies. AI developers were recognized as software companies that leverage hyperscaler technologies to provide solutions for end users. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. AI integrators were pinned down as the larger organizations that have sufficient technology functionality to build their own AI solutions, as well as the IT services companies that support them. AI essentials were singled out as companies that are less directly impacted by the technology itself, but provide the resources that enable the whole AI value chain to work, whether that is energy, air conditioning, raw materials or even the data to train models. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility. The report further highlights that these categories are also likely to be the most exposed to escalating trade tensions between the US and China. The bank predicts ample opportunities for investors in the AI essentials and AI developers bucket over time. Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank JPMorgan. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NASDAQ:EQIX) is a California-based real estate trust that operates data centers and other technology assets. In February 2024, Equinix partnered with NVIDIA to launch a private cloud service, enabling organizations to manage NVIDIA DGX supercomputing infrastructure for developing custom generative AI models. In November 2024, Equinix announced the construction of a sixth International Business Exchange data center in Singapore, named SG6. With an initial investment of $260 million, SG6 will operate on renewable energy and feature liquid cooling capabilities to support compute-intensive AI workloads. These AI-focused developments have positively impacted the financial performance of the firm. In the first half of 2024, the company experienced increased demand for data center services, driven by an artificial intelligence land grab among tech giants like Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta. This surge in demand allowed Equinix to raise rents, with prices for hyperscale tech tenants increasing by 19% during this period. Overall EQIX ranks 26th on our list of the important AI stocks for 2025 according to JP Morgan. While we acknowledge the potential of EQIX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than EQIX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Federal Policies Set A New Tone For Business

Plus: UnitedMasters CEO On Pivoting Recording To Tech, Lack Of Tariffs Kept Markets Steady, How Federal Return-To-Office Policy Could Impact The Private Sector, OpenAI Unveils A Smooth Operator What a difference a week can make. Last Monday, Donald Trump was sworn in for a second term as president. In seven days, executive orders and policy pronouncements have shaken the U.S. and countries globally as he is changing how the United States government does business in terms of employment, immigration policy, criminal justice and diplomacy. And while shifts in the federal government’s internal operations don’t necessarily impact how the private sector runs, it sets a tone, and could inspire businesses to make changes. One of the most prevalent policy shifts is in diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. An executive order signed on the first day of Trump’s presidency ends federal DEI programs, saying that “illegal and immoral” plans in every government department intended to ensure better representation of genders, races and backgrounds throughout government “demonstrated immense public waste and shameful discrimination.” DEI initiatives throughout the government were formally shut down two days later, and employees who worked in DEI offices were immediately put on paid leave. According to a memo, each department is to plan for staff reductions for DEI employees by January 31. Another executive order from Trump brings this crackdown to the private sector. He rescinded a 1965 anti-discrimination order for federal contractors from President Lyndon B. Johnson, requiring agencies to identify contractors who use “coded or imprecise language” to “obscure” DEI initiatives, as well as identifying up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of private sector entities “to deter DEI programs or principles…that constitute illegal discrimination or preferences.” The attorney general will take this information and issue a report of recommendations to take action within 120 days. Even before Trump took office, popularity of DEI initiatives among businesses was already waning. Last week, Target scaled back some of its policies, phasing out its goals to increase hiring and promotions of people of color and women, pulling its participation from external diversity surveys, phasing out anti-racism training, and shifting its supplier diversity team to focus on supplier engagement. But some companies are digging in on diversity. Costco’s shareholders almost unanimously bucked a challenge to its diversity policies, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. The National Center for Public Policy Research had petitioned the retailer to audit the company’s “litigation, reputational and financial risks” caused by its DEI policies. Costco’s leadership rejected the proposal last month and urged shareholders to vote it down, saying that the retailer regularly evaluates its policies. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon also stood firm in his commitment to DEI initiatives, saying, “Bring them on” in an interview with CNBC last week, Forbes senior contributor Jack Kelly writes. The fight over diversity will continue to play out everywhere, and how policies will ultimately be decided is unclear. Time—as well as future measures of the broader economy, company offerings and demographic statistics—will tell. One thing that has remained constant, regardless of who’s in the White House, is technology’s disruption of more traditional industries. The music business has seen a lot of change over the last generation. I talked to Steve Stoute, a former record company executive who founded the tech-enabled and creator-empowering enterprise UnitedMasters. I talked to him about his path to reinventing an old industry. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. President Donald Trump gives a thumbs up to the crowd after speaking at a rally in Las Vegas on Saturday. One thing that didn’t see a ton of change the week Trump took office: the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all moved up less than three points last week, with a bump last Tuesday—the first day of trading in Trump’s second term—and small ups and downs through Friday, largely from earnings reports and other more normal business indicators. A key reason for less volatility in trading is that Trump has held back on putting tariffs in place. He’s threatened tariffs on several nations—Canada and Mexico starting February 1, on Russia if it doesn’t end the war with Ukraine, higher ones for China if it doesn’t cooperate with the sale of TikTok, and on Colombia over not accepting deportees. If and when tariffs actually are announced and prices are likely to change, markets may see bigger swings. The economy is on many peoples’ minds, but consumers are still spending. The National Retail Federation reported that November and December retail sales were a record $994.1 billion, 4% higher than 2023, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Holiday spending exceeded predictions of 2.5% to 3.5% growth. But this growth wasn’t just for the holiday season. Sales for 2024 as a whole grew a record 3.6% to a record $5.28 trillion, the NRF found. The growth is expected to continue, Deloitte reported in its 2025 retail industry outlook, Forbes senior contributor Joan Verdon wrote. The firm predicts that consumer spending will grow by 3.1% in 2025. While this level of spending might be good for business bottom lines, it might not be the best thing for the economy as a whole. In Q3, credit card balances nationwide hit $1.17 trillion—an increase of $24 billion—and 3.5% of all household debt was in some form of delinquency, according to statistics from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Consumer confidence also is declining, with the Conference Board seeing a drop of 8.1 points in December. The expectations index—based on consumers’ short-term outlook for income, business and the labor market—fell 12.6 points to 81.1, just above 80, which usually is a benchmark for a coming recession. getty Another big change for federal workers that may bleed into the private sector: An end to most remote work. Trump signed an executive order mandating federal employees work in the office five days a week. Forbes contributor Terina Allen writes that most of the government’s 2.3 million civilian employees—about 54%—work entirely on-site already, and just 10% work entirely remotely. Forbes senior contributor Jack Kelly writes that this new policy is likely to also make employees quit government jobs, bringing de facto cuts to the size of the federal workforce. This new policy could have a trickle-down effect on the private sector, with more employers—who have wanted more employees spending more time in the office anyway—making the same moves themselves. However, there could be some downsides to following the federal government’s lead. It might ultimately damage workplace culture, making employees feel like they are not trusted, career expert Jasmine Escalera of MyPerfectResume told HR Executive. Meanwhile, some remote-work-friendly executives told MarketWatch that they plan to capitalize on the federal government’s move, attracting highly qualified candidates with a more flexible work environment. They said that the benefits of remote work are clear, and this plan is a step backward. Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Politics aside—even though Trump tried to make some of it political—some big advancements in AI were announced in the last week. On the apolitical front, OpenAI unveiled its “Operator” AI assistant. The company described this tool as an “an agent that can go to the web to perform tasks for you,” completing tasks including making online grocery orders and ticket purchases, downloading lectures, combining PDFs and calculating refunds. It isn’t totally autonomous, and asks users for confirmation before tasks like sending emails or completing orders. It is first be available in a research preview to ChatGPT Pro users. On the potentially political end of the spectrum, Trump unveiled a $500 billion AI infrastructure partnership called “Stargate” between Oracle, OpenAI and SoftBank. This partnership will build several state-of-the-art AI data centers across the U.S. to expand computing power for new developments in the tech space. It’s the type of project Biden had prioritized, signing an executive order before he left office, the Washington Post reported, and that OpenAI had been lobbying for. The Stargate project could help the U.S. keep its lead in AI development, as long as it can figure out several key issues detailed by Forbes contributor Emil Sayegh, including who’s in charge of the sprawling initiative, how data centers will get the electricity they need, and where highly skilled workers who can operate these centers will come from. (Musk has also questioned how solid SoftBank’s funding may be, though it’s unclear if his trolling merely stems from his long-running feud with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.) Not to be outdone, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced on Friday plans to spend $60 billion to $65 billion in capital expenditures this year, with much of that going to AI efforts. Zuckerberg said the company will expand AI teams significantly, and predicted the company’s Llama 4 large language model will become “the leading state-of-the-art” AI model this year. UnitedMasters founder and CEO Steve Stoute, and the "UnitedMasters: A Celebration Of Independence" event at the 65th Grammy Awards. With a career in the music business that started in the 1990s, Steve Stoute has long been a key leader in the space. He served as an executive at Sony Music and Interscope Geffen A&M, then started advertising agency Translation. In 2017, he started UnitedMasters, a technology-driven company that lets artists develop music, get licensing and promotion and reach brand partnerships without going through the traditional record label process. UnitedMasters is valued at $550 million, and its investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Alphabet and 20th Century Fox. I talked to Stoute about reinventing a legacy business for today’s tech landscape. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here. What kind of knowledge and background did you bring to founding UnitedMasters from your years in the traditional recording industry? How did you pivot your expertise? Stoute: I’ve been in the business since ’91. It had gone through such a bad time since MP3s hit, and then it started to migrate into iTunes. Artists had lost. They didn’t know where the revenue was, what the business would be. It was a period of eight years of decline, decline of market share, and no one had a clue what the solution would be. When iTunes came, the good news was that people were paying for music again. The bad news was the price of it was so low, the delta between what it was and what it is going to be was so far off that people had to readjust to these new economics. That’s why you started to see the rise of merch and other items being sold. It was like, ‘Okay, I can’t monetize the music, so let me monetize the higher margin item like a T-shirt or a hoodie.’ Everybody had gotten into that business because there was no more money left just selling records. To me, that was a very clear path, and I wanted to use my understanding of the business and my access to technology. I worked very closely with Ben Horowitz [of Andreessen Horowitz]. He’s on the board of my company. I wanted to work very closely with technology to help build what would be the technical solve for the music business of the future. What advice would you give to an aspiring CEO or leader like you were: They have deep knowledge of a traditional business but they want to start something new that adapts to the times we’re in now? When you’re beginning, ideas don’t come out fully formed and they only become clear as you work on them. You really just have to get started. This whole idea that there’s this eureka moment and then all of a sudden it hits you is actually a dangerous lie. Because you feel like until you have that eureka moment, you’re not prepared to do anything, so you are waiting for this lightning to strike, that never strikes. The key is to move forward with that commitment, so that beautiful journey becomes clear. How did it happen for you? How did you get from feeling that you wanted to do something in this space to building it into UnitedMasters? When I look back at it, in hindsight, I was actually going through a very tough time in my life. Jay-Z and [Interscope Records cofounder and longtime CEO] Jimmy Iovine were both leaving the [traditional] music industry. Jimmy was building a company called Beats Music, which ended up becoming Apple Music, and Jay-Z had bought this [music streaming] company called Tidal. I’m like, if those guys are going into the streaming business, what that means to me is that distribution as we knew it is fully dead. That they’ve accepted that Spotify had no competitors. I’m like, if they’re gone and they’re going after Spotify because they have no competitors, what that means is that the barrier for artists to get to distribution was no longer going to be physical and capital intensive. Those are just two data points that I had. I took those two data points and began to put together an idea that became UnitedMasters. It was certainly not when I was on my front foot. I wasn’t doing great. It wasn’t the optimum time to have an idea, but I kept on thinking about the idea. As I got better, and I became more who I already am, I was like, this is not a good idea. This is a great idea. It’s the future. What I didn’t know was how early I was going to be, and I would reckon to you I was too early. But when you speak to the great VCs, they’ll tell you the gift and the curse of being early is: When you’re early, when you have vision, you see it early, and when you see it early, it just takes longer to happen. So don’t feel bad for being early. If you see it early, that means your vision is really good. Get prepared for the long run, pack enough clothes—AKA get the funding you need, get people who believe in your vision, because it’s going to be a minute. Always stay sharpening your vision because it’s going to happen in iterations over time. You’ve got to always be able to modify as conditions change. The baseline truth won’t change, but some things around it may change. Mergers and acquisitions, new technologies, all these things. You’ve got to be able to be committed to your vision, but yet nimble enough to do what you’ve got to do as things evolve. DeepSeek, a Chinese firm that released an AI model that runs on less powerful chips than those used by OpenAI—but has been able to match its first model on certain benchmarks—caused a tech stock selloff as markets opened Monday. 3.5%: Drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq at Monday’s open 12%: Opening decline for chip maker Nvidia ‘May be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible’: What JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande wrote investors could be thinking right now about the AI investment cycle When a business goes through a crisis situation, it could be devastating.

Title: What Is DeepSeek? China Shocks AI Industry With 'Sputnik Moment'

Chinese AI company DeepSeek released an AI model that is sending shockwaves through the US tech industry due to its low cost and high performance. Tech investor Marc Andreessen calls it "AI's Sputnik moment," causing US tech stocks to tumble this morning, with Nvidia the hardest hit, down 11%. The app surpassed ChatGPT on the Apple App Store as the most-downloaded free application. But after receiving a flood of registrations and "large-scale malicious attacks"—possibly a DDoS attack—DeepSeek has "temporarily" restricted access to those with a +86 mainland Chinese phone number. You may still be able to sign in with a Google account. We downloaded it from the app store before this, and found the interface nearly identical to ChatGPT. It currently has a knowledge cutoff of October 2023, as shown in the screenshot below. But the big game-changer is not the chatbot experience but the open-source model that powers it on the backend. It appears to be the highest-performing available for an ultra-low price. Being open source, anyone with the right skills can download it and use it. The model, dubbed R1, came out on Jan. 20, a few months after DeepSeek released its first model. The company says its performance is "on par with OpenAI-o1,” the model OpenAI debuted in September 2024 with the ability to follow a chain of thought. The company called the approach a "new paradigm" that would bring AI models closer to human-level intelligence. Looking at the pricing specs for the DeepSeek R1 reasoner model and OpenAI's GPT-o1, you'll see R1 is a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek charges $2.19 per 1 million output tokens, compared to $60 for GPT-o1. Even OpenAI's mini version of GPT-o1, which is intended to be a lightweight, more affordable version, costs $12. Like DeepSeek, Meta has made open source its central AI strategy with its Llama models, which are currently free. "To people who see the performance of DeepSeek and think, 'China is surpassing the US in AI.' You are reading this wrong," says Meta's chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, on Threads. "The correct reading is: 'Open source models are surpassing proprietary ones.'" Meta has set up four war rooms to analyze DeepSeek’s technology, focusing on how the company reduced training costs and what data it may have used, according to The Information. There is some controversy over the chips that power R1. DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng, a 40-year-old businessman, reportedly stocked up on Nvidia A100 chips before they were banned from export to China in September 2022. DeepSeek claims R1 runs on lower-capacity Nvidia H800 chips, but it's difficult to know exactly what is going on behind closed doors, especially since A100 chips are still being snuck into China in violation of US sanctions. "Rather than weakening China’s AI capabilities, the sanctions appear to be driving startups like DeepSeek to innovate in ways that prioritize efficiency, resource-pooling, and collaboration," says the MIT Technology Review. The constrained chip supply may have forced the company to place a premium on efficient computing from the start of development. More efficient computing also means less energy use—a welcome innovation given AI's astronomical energy needs. Why has Nvidia's stock price tumbled, even though DeepSeek is still using its chips? Because its AI model does more with less. US tech companies are now coming under fire for a potentially bloated approach to AI development, requiring more and more chips, while being less efficient with them than DeepSeek appears to be. Last week, President Donald Trump announced that Oracle, OpenAI, and Softbank would spearhead a $500 billion investment in AI data centers with the Stargate Project. Data collection is another concern with DeepSeek. Like TikTok, the company is obligated to share user data with the Chinese government if it requests it. The privacy policy lists the data it collects, and how it will use it, including to "comply with our legal obligations." As an open-source platform, that means US companies may feed it their data in addition to everyday chatbot users. I'm the expert at PCMag for all things electric vehicles and AI.

Title: DeepSeek Surges on App Store: What Is the Chinese AI Model and Why Is It a Big Deal?
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/deepseek-what-is-it-chinese-artificial-intelligence-model/
Time Published: 2025-01-27T16:52:19Z

China’s artificial intelligence company jumped past OpenAI’s ChatGPT on the Apple App Store after releasing two new models DeepSeek sent shock waves through the artificial intelligence world this past weekend and Wall Street on Monday. If you follow the tech industry even sparingly — or happened to jump on X or the App Store recently — you likely saw the name. But what is DeepSeek, and what is the big deal all about? Let’s jump into it. For starters, DeepSeek is a Chinese AI company and research lab that creates open-source large language models, or LLMs. Open-source LLMs are AI models that allow others to build on its technology. X’s Grok and Meta’s Llama are some other well-known open-source LLMs, while OpenAI’s ChatGPT is the most popular closed-source LLM. Why Is It In the News? DeepSeek released its R1 and R1-Zero reasoning models on Jan. 20, and their capabilities quickly gained notice in the tech and AI worlds. In particular, there are two key aspects to DeepSeek’s latest releases: 1) Refined Reinforcement DeepSeek’s model uses a technique called Reinforcement — where a model makes decisions to achieve a certain goal — that goes beyond other models. That is because it does not use human feedback to refine itself, which other models do. As Ben Thompson of the tech-focused Stratechery blog put it succinctly: “LLMs to date, however, have relied on reinforcement learning with human feedback; humans are in the loop to help guide the model, navigate difficult choices where rewards aren’t obvious, etc… R1-Zero, however, drops the HF part — it’s just reinforcement learning.” 2) Distillation Another important factor here is DeepSeek’s distillation technique. Distillation is where a smaller model like DeepSeek is able to lift the information from larger models, while also using less memory and computing power. This also helps cut down on costs. DeepSeek said its recent breakthroughs cost less than $6 million and took less than two months to build. Why Is This a Big Deal? From a macro standpoint, it shows that China — remember, China’s communist government is closely linked to all of its companies, especially the major tech firms that branch out into different markets — is further along in AI innovation than many had thought. And DeepSeek’s performance is particularly noteworthy, given its low cost and its ability to navigate around chip restrictions that were rolled out by former President Joe Biden. Marc Andreessen, co-founder of the tech-focused Andreessen Horowitz venture capital firm, called it AI’s “sputnik moment” on Sunday. Competitors DeepSeek has crashed an already-crowded AI space. It leapfrogged ChatGPT in the Apple App Store as the most-downloaded free app this weekend, indicating there is strong user interest in what DeepSeek can do. Many analysts believe DeepSeek, and what is means about Chinese AI capabilities, was the main reason the U.S. stock market was down on Monday morning, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.72% in the first 90 minutes of trading. Meta, which announced on Friday it would be investing $60 billion-$65 billion to fuel its AI business, was not hit by the Monday drop, with its share price climbing about 1.5% in early trading. Google, which has its own AI model, Gemini, did see its stock price drop about 2.5%, while Tesla was down 1%, although its business is obviously more than just its AI component. Microsoft, OpenAI’s partner, saw its stock price drop 3.7%. The biggest hit was to Nvidia, which supplies chips and other important tech that undergirds AI development. Its stock price was down 14.8% in the first hour and a half of trading on Monday. Censorship? To reinforce that DeepSeek is ultimately beholden to China’s government, many noted this weekend that its model will not answer certain questions on topics the CCP is not a fan of — like the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. This is similar to how TheWrap recently found “Little Red Book,” aka “RedNote,” would censor content about Tiananmen Square or China’s treatment of the Uyghurs.

I'm back! Fresh off my trip to Davos I'm jumping right into it. DeepSeek's AI models are spooking tech stocks this morning. The Chinese AI lab has been rolling out new models in recent weeks, and they're cheaper than rival OpenAI's. DeepSeek's models are open-source, which means they're available for anyone who wants to use them for free. That's a challenge to OpenAI, which keeps its top models proprietary, and charges premium prices for them. In a paper released last Monday, DeepSeek unveiled a new flagship AI model called R1 that shows off a new level of "reasoning" — and it has left much of America's top industry researchers stunned. DeepSeek hit No. 1 on the Apple App Store's Top Free Apps Chart days later. It's the latest disruption in AI, and markets are feeling the shock, with Nvidia down by more than 10% premarket on Monday. Meanwhile, in today's newsletter, we're focusing on investors' exuberance over the new administration has some wondering if people are getting ahead of themselves. What's on deck Markets: Multistrat hedge funds just can't quit Manhattan. Tech: VC Twitter has found a new love — LinkedIn. Business: Breakfast isn't getting cheaper anytime soon thanks to the price of eggs. But first, hot out the gates. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. There are plenty of uncertainties with the new administration. How investors feel about Donald Trump's pro-business agenda isn't one of them. Stocks reached record highs during the president's first week in office, and there's plenty of hope that it's just the beginning. Trump's consistent message of deregulation and lower corporate taxes has investors excited about the resulting growth potential. Some in the market, however, aren't as convinced. Business Insider's Jennifer Sor has a story on how investors might be wearing Trump-tinted glasses that are hiding some real risks. Much of the concern stems from persistently high interest rates, worries that were pushed aside last week as investors focused on Trump's pro-growth agenda. And while the aggressiveness of Trump's tariff policy remains unclear, many believe it will eventually push inflation higher, further dampening views of stimulative rate cuts. While the market has elected to look past elevated rates, the ever-important 10-year Treasury yield crept up as much as 13 basis points during the four-day week. The US market has the benefit of somewhat being the only game in town, though. European economies are in a much weaker position than the US, which dents the future earnings potential of companies there. And the threat of more regulation makes them even less inviting. China's economy, meanwhile, is struggling to mount a comeback. It's also one of Trump's biggest foreign targets. And while there's always a chance of reconciliation, that's a risky bet. Still, the US stock market is heavily concentrated in mega-cap tech names, which some see as a looming risk. Albert Edwards, a famously bearish strategist, shared three charts that illustrate how top-heavy things are, writes BI's Will Edwards. But investors seem willing to keep betting on the US. Meanwhile, with only one term to implement his plan, Trump has no time to waste. That means businesses (and the people investing in them) will just need to prepare for a bit of a bumpy ride. BI's John L. Dorman, Brent D. Griffiths, and Bryan Metzger have a breakdown of all the shockwaves Trump has already sent through corporate America during his first week. Trump and Musk are at odds again. This time over the UK prime minister. 1. New York City is still the center of the hedge fund universe. Despite interest in sunnier places like Miami, regulatory filings reveal most portfolio managers at multistrategy hedge funds work from the Big Apple. That includes funds like Balyasny, Citadel, and Point72, which are headquartered elsewhere. 2. Inside the routine and leadership style of a Citadel partner. Micah Nance runs a team of nine analysts and associates that covers about 150 tech and media companies out of the hedge fund's Dallas office. He spoke to BI about his 13 years climbing the ranks at the high-profile firm, how he manages his time, and some career advice. 3. Here come the crypto hires. The market and regulators are both getting behind digital assets again. As a result, both fintechs and traditional finance firms are staffing up. 1. The Zuckermoon is over. The Meta CEO was on the precipice of becoming cool after his major makeover and "wife guy" revamp. But he's lost brownie points with some since dealing blows to Meta's fact-checking system, writes BI's Katie Notopoulos. The comments section — and even AI's opinion — is ruthless. 2. The buzz around voice AI. The tech isn't new, but investors are excited about its vast use cases and recent rapid sophistication. BI spoke to investors about the untapped opportunities they see in the sector, from real-time audio transcriptions to generating synthetic voices. 3. VC Twitter takes LinkedIn. Though X remains the platform of choice for venture capitalists, they're starting to post more on LinkedIn. VCs told BI they see better "ROI" on their posts on the workplace social-networking site, and that it's where business can actually get done. 1. Cheap eggs aren't on the horizon. Bird flu isn't going anywhere, and it's limiting supply. Meanwhile, a surge in consumer "egg-citement" is driving demand. A push to treat chickens better isn't cheap, either — and it's all reflected in the current egg prices. 2. Eli Lilly's weight-loss wonders. The Mounjaro and Zepbound producer hopes to close the gap with competitor Novo Nordisk's Ozempic — and take things a step further. Eli Lilly's head of obesity teased a pill to rival Ozempic and a triple-threat "King Kong" injection to mimic bariatric surgery. The ultimate dream: a once-per-year weight-loss shot. 3. Gen Z is already fed up with work — and it's not about laziness. Less than a third of young American workers felt engaged at their job last year, a report from Gallup found. The younger generation hasn't wasted time taking a transactional view of work, BI's Aki Ito wrote. However, with low engagement costing businesses $9 trillion a year worldwide, employers need to step it up. I'm the CEO of a multibillion-dollar company. These seven lessons have shaped my success.

The Lost Head and the Bird (Sohrab Hura, 2018). “We are excited to announce insulin is free now.” At first glance, this November 2022 Twitter post from @EliLillyandCo appeared to be a legitimate announcement from the pharmaceutical company; the account’s profile featured an icon of Eli Lilly and Company’s logo and a blue check mark that, until the previous day, signified the account had been formally verified by the platform’s dedicated staff. But in the hands of new owner Elon Musk, who completed his acquisition of the platform two weeks earlier, Twitter’s verification process underwent significant modification. Suddenly, verification was available to anyone with an authenticated phone number and a willingness to pay $8 a month for the platform’s Premium plan. Twitter, soon to be rebranded as X, inevitably descended into chaos, rife with impersonators and misinformation. Eli Lilly’s stock share price fell by 4.37 percent in one day. What, above all, this episode seemed to signal was the breakdown of institutional responsibility. Prioritizing revenue over accountability, Twitter abandoned any pretense that it would be an arbiter of authenticity; Meta recently followed suit, announcing on January 7 of this year that it would be ditching its fact-checkers in favor of a crowdsourced system of community notes. In our era of “post-truth” politics, images and videos have become laden with new economies of meaning, not all of them based in fact. Social media platforms, as we have seen time and time again, are not neutral mediators but actively influence the reception of content—whether by amplifying certain narratives through algorithmic promotion, stripping or adding context via content labels, or allowing virality to determine credibility. You’ll find a similar line of interest in the crisp, hyper-saturated pictures of the Indian photographer and filmmaker Sohrab Hura, whose recent projects take up a study of synthetic images and how they are distributed. He began working this way as a direct response to the 2004 Indian election, in which the Bharatiya Janata Party’s ultranationalism and “India Shining” slogan aimed to project an image of an economically strong and empowered country—one far from the reality lived by many Indians, especially those in rural areas. Returning to power in 2014 with Narendra Modi as prime minister, the BJP undertook an even more aggressive campaign of propaganda and distortion. V. K. Singh, a cabinet minister, has referred to journalists as “presstitutes.” Modi claims to have once worked as a humble tea seller on a railway platform, though a 2015 Right to Information query cast doubt on his story. Campaign video for Manoj Tiwari, a BJP candidate for parliament, appears to show him speaking English and Haryanvi, the latter a direct appeal to Delhi’s large population of migrant workers. When it was revealed that the original speech was in Hindi, and that the other versions were AI-assisted deepfakes, the BJP dismissed the episode as an experiment. Sohrab Hura, Remains of the day, 2024. Soft pastel on paper. Courtesy of the artist and Experimenter, Kolkata and Mumbai. Surreal times call for surrealist art. Mother, now on view at MoMA PS1 in New York, is the first US survey of Hura’s work. It orchestrates a kaleidoscope of images and sounds, plunging viewers into a maelstrom of ambiguity where truth is indistinguishable from fiction. Single-channel videos flash and whir, suffused with a palpable anxiety. His lurid pastel illustrations and paintings in gouache and acrylics show some fidelity to photography, composed like snapshots or selfies. Together, these varied forms of practice seem to ask if some mediums are more inclined to capture reality than others. In Mother, we find not just Hura’s inquiry into the self, but into his motherland. Things Felt but Not Quite Expressed, a collection of Hura’s illustrations with sardonically self-referential titles, was created between 2022 and 2024, when he was experiencing a disconnect from the fixed nature of photography, moving from image to illustration to capture the idiosyncrasies of quotidian life in an increasingly polarized world. A meme of a French bulldog captioned “Men over 35 in skinny jeans”; impressionistic lashings of bright color; a portrait of a refugee Palestinian couple lying idly in a Syrian field—the art of Things Felt is by turns dreamy, hilarious, and deeply moving. It also speaks to Hura’s recent efforts to consolidate emotional truth into his images. Photographic glitches allow Hura to explore the manipulation and distortion of meaning in a world increasingly dominated by algorithm-driven images. A glitch could be as simple as the warping of a scanned photo, or the telltale signs of some crude Photoshopping. (Think of the hysteria that Princess Catherine’s doctored Mother’s Day photo caused earlier this year and the very meme-able apology that followed: “Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing.”) Hura views these glitches as “fault lines of doubt,” spaces that allow new layers of understanding to emerge.1 They “have this ability to give us a sense of the real in an increasingly fake world," he explains, pointing to the onslaught of edited images we are exposed to daily.2 As AI and algorithms generate more viral content, he believes the future of photography and film lies in these mistakes and accidents, indissoluble from human nature. The Lost Head and the Bird (Sohrab Hura, 2018). Hura works to draw out that fluidity in his films, too. In The Lost Head and the Bird (2018), the artist induces sensory overload through a rapid-fire montage of found footage—images of Bollywood stars, right-wing propaganda, and bloody violence—all interleaved with Hura’s own photographs. The intensity of this visual barrage is amplified by a frenetic soundtrack by Hannes d’Hoine and Sjoerd Bruil, which disrupts our ability to accurately interpret what we see. The film takes its name from the surreal one-page story and photo series published in Hura’s book The Coast (2019), which introduces Madhu, a pitiful woman whose head was stolen by a jealous ex-lover as her pet bird escaped its cage. In the film, a fortune teller sells Madhu a crow, having convinced her that it’s a parrot with a bad cough. The final character in the story, Hura explains, is himself: the photographer, complicit in this violence and deception. In implicating himself, he also implicates the viewer in this voyeurism, claiming that “both of us are helping circulate these images,” blurring the lines between participant and observer.3 Watching The Lost Head is a borderline hallucinatory experience. An iteration of the project for MoMA in 2021 featured twelve versions of the film accompanied by unnerving short stories, each a slight variation of the one that came before. By subtly changing our understanding of Madhu in each retelling, Hura plays with our instinct to trust photographic images and escalates the viewer’s confusion. Confounding any notion of objectivity, he evinces how meaning can be warped not just by manipulating images but also through the sequencing of information. The Coast (Sohrab Hura, 2020). Using footage and stills taken after religious celebrations in a coastal village in Tamil Nadu, The Coast (2020) retains this slightly surreal quality, though its narrative is far more tightly controlled. The project began as a photobook in 2018, and the film develops the original concept by embracing a plurality of forms, using the margin between land and water as a point of release to explore the undercurrents of religious, sexual, and caste-related violence along India’s coastline. The intimate footage transitions from sacred communal fervor to quiet, unsettling moments of post-festival reflection, in which bodies and spaces take on an otherworldly quality. Once again, Hura manipulates context by covertly adding and removing details to blur lines between reality and artifice; his harsh, unforgiving flash creates visuals that mirror the fragmented, fetishistic language of social media images. In The Coast, this litany is brought to life by shots of India’s shoreline, deployed throughout Hura’s work as a metaphor for a society on the brink of collapse. But here, the sea also manifests as a site of religious ritual as demonic masquerades, bloodletting, scenes of destitution, deformity, and anguish unfold. At first, the lapping waves seethe with libidinal energy, then the film gradually transitions to more serene images of darkened figures diving into the ocean, submitting to its primal force. This climactic moment, when the sea collides with grainy, ecstatic bodies, offers them release from artifice in their heightened psychospiritual state. As Hura puts it, “nothing is definite, everything is raw and overwhelming.” While The Lost Head islaced with references to Ganesha, The Coast affects allusions to religion more literally as festivalgoers masquerade as different deities, entering a trancelike frenzy as their bodies hit the water, which washes away their face paint. Hura explains that in India, “perhaps more so than anywhere else, fiction, stories … live longer than factual stories. They are allegories that people return to, constants in the ongoing turbulence of politics, religion, and caste.”4 This idea of enduring allegories seems especially pertinent in a time when religious narratives are increasingly distorted and weaponized. The BJP, for example, has made incendiary anti-Muslim rhetoric integral to its political strategy. During the 2024 election, the party explicitly framed themselves as defenders of Hindu interests, portraying Muslims as an external threat. In May 2024, civil and corporate watchdog groups submitted fake advertisements to Meta as a test of their filtering mechanisms: one proclaimed that “Hindu blood is spilling, these invaders must be burned,” while another called for the execution of a rival political leader. Both were approved to appear on Facebook and Instagram. Pati (Sohrab Hura, 2010). Given Hura’s deliberate shift away from aesthetic objectivity in recent years, it’s interesting that his earlier work is marked by an earnest confidence in film’s potential for truth-telling. His first film, Pati (2010), is an eleven-minute black-and-white documentary featuring barren landscapes—the aftermath of deforestation and deprivation—in the village of Pati, Madhya Pradesh. Collating photos taken in 2005, the projectchronicles the final push from activists, students, academics, journalists, and artists campaigning for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act: a landmark bill that, once implemented, guaranteed 100 days per year of minimum-wage employment for all adult members of a rural household. One particularly moving scene shows children working at a construction site. “Life is not the easiest for [them],” says Hura in voice-over. “There is no respite for anyone over here, and any hand is a helping hand, no matter how small it is.” Pati’s framing of children’s resilience here shares an edifying quality with Francis Alÿs’s Children’s Games video series (1999–), which also looks to make sense of injustice through the eyes of the innocent. While Alÿs films with an anthropological closeness, Hura instead draws attention to his role as the “idiot photographer”: a spectator all too aware of his role in the complicity and cruelty required to make such images.5 Yet his self-awareness doesn’t necessarily absolve him; by foregrounding his own position, Hura risks turning ethical scrutiny into an aesthetic device, one that allows the film to acknowledge its own voyeurism without disrupting it. In this way, Pati becomes complicit in the very structures of image-making it seeks to expose. Bittersweet (Sohrab Hura, 2019). In an earlier short, Bittersweet (2019), Hura initially resisted this impulse to question the ethical place of the photographer. Documenting Hura’s life over ten years, the film focuses on his mother—diagnosed with acute paranoid schizophrenia when he was seventeen—and her relationship with her dog, Elsa. Here, his discomfort was more personal, shaped by his dual role as both son and photographer. Looking back on the film in 2019, he explained his early reluctance to share this work: I didn’t want to feel vulnerable. I didn’t want others to look at her in pity or shock. At the time I had thought that I was being protective of her, but I soon realized that I was actually being protective of myself. How they might have looked at my mother would also define how they looked at me and that scared me. But how could I continue to parachute into someone else’s life and photograph another mother when I couldn’t photograph my own? I had started to feel sure that I needed to turn the camera on myself. I felt that I needed to earn my right to photograph someone else’s life by first putting my own out there with nothing held back.6 In that sense, Bittersweet functions like an eerie family album: grainy, overexposed photos overlaid with discordant sounds, produced by transforming light exposure readings of the scanned photos into sound frequencies. Like synaptic connections, the images weave together fragments of his mother’s fractured reality, allowing the viewer the impression of witnessing a schizophrenic episode through intrusive snapshots. Sometimes she smokes, looking melancholic; sometimes she lies in bed, smiling with Elsa. While Bittersweet remains Hura’s most personal—certainly his most vulnerable—work to date, it represents a significant shift in his engagement with reality. As he questions the boundaries between personal exposure and public consumption, Hura moves beyond mere documentation, instead drawing the viewer into his intimate, subjective experience and the complex social processes through which images are consumed and interpreted. Today, Hura's work takes on a new urgency. Meta plans to populate its platforms with AI-generated users; there has been a surge in harassment, hate speech, and misinformation since Musk’s takeover of X. (And that’s without accounting for the platform’s role in aiding Trump secure the US Presidency, or Musk’s attempts to wade into British politics.) None of this is new thematic territory for Hura, though, who has spoken about the political ramifications of digitally altered images for years. “With algorithms and AI now making most of these viral videos and images—and this is only going to get more prolific and perverse—I feel the future of photography lies in its glitches,” he observes. “As photographers, we will make mistakes, and accidents will happen, and these will help us remember that we are still human.”7 Hura’s art toys with the manipulability of images and their contexts, challenging viewers to chart the hidden codes and meanings embedded within them. In his films, we find a madness that asks us to suspend our belief while drawing us in deeper: we find a world in disarray, much like our own. Don't miss our latest features and interviews.
