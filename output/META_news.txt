UPDATED 19:42 EDT / JUNE 20 2025 by Maria Deutscher Apple Inc. executives have held discussions about buying Perplexity AI Inc., Bloomberg reported today. The publication cited sources as saying that the talks are in an early stage and may not lead to an acquisition. Perplexity reportedly received a $14 billion valuation in a recent funding round. To be accepted, any takeout offer made by Apple would likely have to be higher. San Francisco-based Perplexity operates a consumer-focused search engine powered by artificial intelligence models. Rather than returning a list of webpages in response to queries, the service generates a natural language response. It can also visualize stock price changes, analyze user-uploaded files and perform other tasks. Perplexity had more than 15 million monthly users last April, a number that has likely increased significantly since then. The company recently disclosed that it processed 780 million user requests in May. Moreover, the volume of queries that it receives is growing by 20% every month. Perplexity generates revenue by offering two paid editions of its search engine. The first, Perplexity Pro, gives users access to reasoning models from providers such as OpenAI. There’s also an Enterprise Pro plan geared towards large organizations. Perplexity’s other revenue source is its Sonar suite of application programming interfaces for developers. Using the APIs, software teams can embed the core features of the company’s search engine into their custom applications. Adrian Perica, Apple’s vice president of corporate development, has reportedly discussed the idea of buying Perplexity with a number of other executives. It’s believed the search provider wasn’t involved in the talks. However, Apple representatives did meet with Perplexity executives multiple times recently to discuss its technology. Today’s report follows an unsuccessful attempt by Meta Platforms Inc. to acquire Perplexity. According to Bloomberg, the Facebook parent walked away from the deal over disagreements about financial terms. Meta later made a $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI Inc., a startup that supplies training datasets for AI development projects. It’s believed that Apple could eventually decide to partner with Perplexity instead of buying it. Such an arrangement would likely cost significantly less. Additionally, it would have a lower chance of drawing scrutiny from antitrust regulators. The acquisition discussions come against the backdrop of a high-profile antitrust trial over Google LLC’s search business. Currently, the Alphabet unit pays Apple billions of dollars annually to keep its search engine the default option on iOS. The lawsuit could potentially require the companies to end the payments. If that happens, Apple may be more inclined to partner with Google competitors such as Perplexity. Perplexity is not the only AI startup that has drawn takeover interest. According to CNBC, Meta recently tried to buy Safe Superintelligence Inc., a company co-founded by former OpenAI Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever. After the offer was rebuffed, the Facebook parent reportedly shifted its focus to recruiting the startup’s top executives.

Title: Crypto stocks soar after Senate passes stablecoin bill, Circle up over 50%

Catherine McGrath is a crypto fellow at Fortune. Shares of the first publicly-traded stablecoin company Circle continued to surge on Friday after the Senate passed legislation that would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a value in line with the U.S. dollar, earlier this week. Shares of Circle are up 53%, soaring from $148 to $227, since the market opened on Wednesday after the legislation passed in the Senate on Tuesday night. Shares of other crypto-related companies increased on the news with Coinbase, the leading crypto exchange in the U.S., gaining 20% since Wednesday. The legislation, known as the GENIUS act, is a first-of-its-kind bill that would establish regulations and consumer protections for stablecoin companies, including full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance. After passing in the Senate, it will be sent to the House of Representatives for a vote and potential revisions. Circle issues USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market cap behind Tether’s USDT. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire expressed his support for the bill in a post on X after the Senate vote on Tuesday night. “History is being made, as the US Senate passes the GENIUS Act, taking us one step closer to breakthrough legislation being signed into law that will drive U.S. economic and national competitiveness for decades to come,” he wrote. The surge in Circle’s stock price comes weeks after the company’s debut on the stock market under the ticker CRCL. After pricing its shares at $31, CRCL opened on the New York Stock Exchange at $69. Within its first day on the market, the company’s shares soared to a high of $103.75 before closing at $82.23, showcasing strong retail demand for access to the stablecoin industry. Since 2021, stablecoins have become increasingly popular outside of the U.S. as a means to settle cross-border transfers and protect assets against inflation. Crypto firms, however, have long complained that the U.S. stablecoin industry has been hindered by a lack of clear regulations, especially under Biden-era Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler who initiated dozens of investigations and enforcement actions against crypto companies. The Senate’s passage of the GENIUS act was aided by President Donald Trump’s vocal support of the broader crypto industry. In addition to pushing for Congress to pass the stablecoin bill, Trump has established a national Bitcoin reserve, pardoned crypto criminal Ross Ulbricht and appointed SEC officials that have ended a number of lawsuits against crypto companies. With support from the U.S. president and increasing regulatory clarity, mainstream corporations are considering implementing them into their payment structures, including Meta, Google, AirBnB and X. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Why Elon Musk’s US$34 billion loss wasn’t really that – and what it tells us about the philanthropy of the ultra-wealthy

Professor of Management, University of St Andrews Tobias Jung does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment. University of St Andrews provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners Following a sharp drop in Tesla’s share price, outlets reported that the world’s richest person, Elon Musk, had “lost” US$34 billion (£25 billion) in a single day. That figure exceeds the annual GDP of countries like Iceland, Jamaica or Mauritius. Gaining or losing even 0.001% of that wealth would be life-changing for most people. But, this “loss” is entirely nominal. A decline in share prices means Musk is technically worth less. If prices rebound, so does his net worth. While such volatility can devastate smaller investors reliant on their portfolios, it is a recurring feature of ultra-wealth. Consider the US$100 billion decline in Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s fortune during his Metaverse pivot, or the US$18 billion drop Microsoft founder Bill Gates experienced during the 2008 financial crisis. These share price shifts may reduce billionaires’ net worth on paper, but they rarely affect their lifestyle. Where they do matter however is in philanthropy. Here, timing is everything. The higher the share price at the point of donation, the greater the tax benefit, and the more reputational capital to be locked in. This raises deeper questions about how philanthropic incentives are structured, and who ultimately benefits. Get your news from actual experts, straight to your inbox. Sign up to our daily newsletter to receive all The Conversation UK’s latest coverage of news and research, from politics and business to the arts and sciences. Although philanthropy is often associated with generosity, legacy or moral responsibility, these are only part of the picture. This is particularly true when it comes to major giving by the ultra-wealthy. Instead, from a wealth advisory perspective, one of the most strategically valuable (yet less publicly discussed) motivations is tax management. And, while many assume that philanthropy means donating money, tax systems often encourage the donation of appreciated assets, particularly shares, instead. As a worked example by the Bank of America illustrates, a US$50,000 donation in appreciated stock might easily present a tax benefit of almost US$10,000 over and above the tax benefits of donating the same amount in cash. Why is that? First of all, there is the potential of a tax deduction equal to the fair market value at the point of donation. The value of the asset at the point of donation is important for your tax deduction, not what you actually paid for it or whether its value is going to plunge in future. On top of that, there are opportunities to reduce other taxes too. This includes capital gains or inheritance taxes, the latter illustrated in the establishment of one of the world’s largest foundations, the Ford Foundation and its use as a vehicle to manage both inheritance tax and maintain corporate control. But the benefits of donating shares and other appreciated assets are not just financial. For high-profile donors, philanthropy also serves as a powerful tool for shaping public perceptions, projecting images of civic virtue, moral leadership, and social responsibility. It allows them to convert one form of capital, such as financial wealth, into others – social status, cultural influence or symbolic legitimacy. Volatile, appreciated and often bound-up assets can be unlocked and transformed into something far more enduring – a philanthropic legacy. Even if share prices plunge after the donation, the donor has already secured both a substantial tax benefit and a lasting philanthropic image. Tax management is a longstanding concern in philanthropy, particularly in relation to philanthropic foundations. But it really is donor advised funds (DAFs) that now warrant closer scrutiny as the real “warehouses of wealth”. Constituting one of the fastest-growing vehicles for philanthropy, DAFs act as “giving accounts”. They allow donors to claim charitable contributions and receive immediate tax deductions but without actually making an immediate charitable contribution to society. While donors technically give up ownership of these assets, they retain advisory privileges over whether and when resources are granted, to whom, and in what amounts. DAFs have no legal requirement to disburse funds within a specific timeframe. That means that any charitable spending can be delayed, potentially indefinitely, despite the upfront public subsidy via tax relief. All of these issues raise serious questions as to whether philanthropic architecture is ripe for reform. When donors can receive substantial tax and social benefits by donating volatile assets, regardless of whether or when they benefit the public, it seems that both society and the philanthropy field are shortchanged. First, significant resources are diverted from the public purse into privately controlled channels, often with limited oversight. Second, charitable giving is decoupled from charitable action or impact. Third, influence is consolidated – decisions about how public-subsidised funds are used are made not through democratic processes, but through private choice. The most corrosive effect, however, may be on philanthropy itself. As financial incentives and personal benefits are recast and presented as altruistic, the perception, purposes and potential of philanthropy for the public good risk being eroded and replaced by cynicism. This brings us back to Musk’s US$34 billion “loss”. While headlines framed it as a dramatic reversal of fortune, the real story lies not in the number but in the system behind it. For those whose wealth is held in stock, market volatility presents a tool for tax planning, image-making, strategic giving and long-term influence. What looks like loss may in fact be leverage.

Title: S&P To Crash 50%? Trump Calls Jerome Powell “Dumbest”
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/06/20/sp-to-crash-50-trump-calls-jerome-powell-dumbest/

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. President Donald Trump reignited his long-standing feud with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday, calling him "one of the dumbest, and most destructive, people in Government [sic]". This is new territory. President Trump had mostly resisted from hurling direct insults against Fed Chair Powell in his second term. Not any more. Could this escalate into Trump firing Chair Powell over the next few months? The comment on social media followed the Fed’s decision to hold interest rates steady, with the Federal Open Market Committee maintaining its target range at 4.25% to 4.5% - unchanged since December. Trump has been calling for lower rates, noting that the Fed was costing the country billions in interest payments. Facade of the Marriner S Eccles building of the United States Federal Reserve, on a bright and sunny ... More day in Washington, DC, United States, July 24, 2017. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) Trump’s rhetoric sure does make headlines, but the real danger for investors is the Fed buckling under political pressure and cutting rates too soon. That could unleash a second wave of inflation, which might be more entrenched than the post-Covid surge. If that happens, expect a sharp reset in valuations, a spike in bond yields, and a steep correction in the S&P 500. Cutting interest rates before inflation is fully tamed risks igniting a more persistent cycle of price increases, forcing the Fed to respond later with even more aggressive hikes, just as it did in the 1970s, when inflation spiraled out of control. Is 50% drop in S&P possible? Consider this. Back then, the Fed’s delayed tightening led to stagflation and a severe equity downturn: the S&P 500 fell nearly 50% between 1972 and 1974. What’s more, higher valuations today, coupled with policy uncertainty, might actually make things worse. For investors seeking upside with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative. This portfolio has outperformed the S&P 500 and delivered cumulative returns of over 91% since inception. Trump's Policies Create The Perfect Storm? This time around, there is a risk of persistent supply-side inflation driven by policy. Trump’s policy agenda, which includes 3 things [1] tariffs, [2] mass deportations, and [3] tax cuts, could create a perfect storm of sorts. First, tariffs are a supply shock. They raise input costs and consumer prices by removing cheaper imports from the market. Second, mass deportations of immigrants who entered the country illegally sounds reasonable - after all, they’re illegal immigrants - except that it will make cheaper labor unavailable. On average, the price of services will go up. This could be a big factor driving inflation higher. Third, there are the tax cuts under Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill, under which most taxpayers are expected to see a tax cut, with all income groups reportedly likely to benefit. Now, while tariffs and deportations constrain the supply of goods and services to increase prices, reduction in taxes makes more cash available to consumers. So people can spend more while prices are higher. The result would be spiking inflation, and this would make the Fed’s job a lot harder. A Replay of the 1970s? The Fed will likely pull out its 2022 playbook: it’ll have no choice but to increase interest rates - not just reverting some of the recent cuts, but in fact, going beyond, to rates above 6% and even 7% or higher for short-term treasuries. Now, if you can get a guaranteed 6% on a 1-year Treasury bill, or bank savings - risk-free investments - won’t you demand higher earnings and returns from stocks as well? There will be an exodus - a massive outflow from the S&P and overall markets from risky equities into treasuries, CDs, and savings accounts. It happened in 2022 - within months, the S&P 500 tumbled by 20%. It’s easy to forget that stocks including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) had lost more than 50% in the 2022 rate cycle alone (Can Nvidia Stock Lose 50%?). Smaller companies, with less cash on their balance sheets, fared even worse. That said, in 2022, inflation was largely transitory, and the Fed was able to bring it under control. This time, it could be entrenched. Covid-related stimulus money was a transient cause of 2022 inflation. This time, tariffs, tax cuts, and deportations, together, are likely to prove a stronger and perhaps much more persistent force. A replaying of the 1970s crisis is very much possible, taking the S&P 500 down. Higher rates don’t just hurt stocks - they make U.S. debt less sustainable. Annual interest payments now already exceed $1 trillion, and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has called it a red flag. If bond markets start to question the government’s fiscal path, yields could spike, deepening the equity selloff. On top of that, loan defaults are rising both in the commercial real estate sector and across consumer debt, like credit cards and auto loans. Big lenders like JPMorgan, BofA, and Citigroup are especially exposed. So, how much would that hurt? Well, the combined market cap of S&P 500 constituents is roughly $47 trillion. So a 50% decline in the index would mean a loss of more than $23 trillion in value. And you thought the $5 trillion-plus wipeout the benchmark index witnessed in the first few days of April 2025 was bad! How Low Can JPMorgan Stock Go In A Market Crash? A Question When things are bad, what do you expect Trump to do? Blame everyone else, or change his course on taxes, deportation, and tariffs? There’s certainly hope that his cabinet and loyalists will be able to sway his view into easing inflationary policies in the event they create spiking inflation before the U.S. economy plunges into a recession. But if the easing does not materialize or comes into play too late, how bad can things get if there is another recession?

InfoQ Homepage Articles Analyzing Apache Kafka Stretch Clusters: WAN Disruptions, Failure Scenarios, and DR Strategies Jun 20, 2025 31 min read by Srikanth Daggumalli Nishchai Jayanna Manjula reviewed by Steef-Jan Wiggers Apache Kafka is a well-known publish-subscribe distributed system widely used across industries for use cases such as log analytics, observability, event-driven architectures, and real-time streaming. Its distribution allows it to become the critical piece or backbone of modern streaming architecture, offering many integrations and supporting near-real-time or real-time latency requirements. Today, Kafka has been offered by major companies as a service, including Confluent Kafka as well as cloud offerings such as Confluent Cloud, AWS Managed Streaming Kafka , Google Cloud Managed Service for Apache Kafka, Azure Event Hub for Apache Kafka, etc. Additionally, Kafka has been deployed across over one-hundred-thousand companies, including Fortune 100 across various industry segments such as enterprise, financials, healthcare, automobile, startups, independent software vendors, and retail sectors. The value of the data diminishes over time. Many businesses these days compete in time and demand real-time data processing with millisecond responses to power mission-critical applications. Financial services, e-commerce, IoT, and other latency-sensitive industries require highly available and resilient architectures that can withstand infrastructure failures without impacting business continuity. Companies operating across multiple geographic locations need solutions that provide seamless failover, data consistency, and disaster recovery (DR) capabilities while minimizing operational complexity and cost. One of the common architectural patterns that companies often consider using is a single Kafka cluster spanning multiple data center locations on WAN (Wide Area Network). It is called Stretch Cluster. This pattern is commonly considered by companies for disaster recovery (DR) and high availability (HA). Stretch Cluster can theoretically provide data redundancy across regions and minimize data loss in the event of a region-wide failure. However, this approach comes with several challenges and trade-offs due to the inherent nature of Kafka and its dependency on network latency, consistency, and partition tolerance in a multi-region setup. In this article, we are going to focus on the stretch cluster architectural pattern for DR or HA-related implications and considerations. The following testing has been conducted, and the cluster behavior has been documented. Below is the high-level view of a single stretch cluster setup that spans across the London and Frankfurt regions with In this use case, we have used a producer written in Java that consistently produces defined (K) Transactions Per Second (aka TPS), which can be controlled using properties files. Sample snippets using Kafka performance test api. In this use case, we have used consumers written in Java that consistently consume defined (K) transactions per second (TPS), which can be controlled using properties files. Before diving into further discussions and scenario executions, it's crucial to understand the fundamental algorithms of distributed systems. This foundational knowledge will help you better correlate WAN disruptions with their impact on system behavior. CAP Theorem (i.e., Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance) applies to all the distributed systems like Kafka, Hadoop, Elasticsearch, and many others, where data is being distributed across nodes to: Consistency (C) Every read gets the latest write or an error. Availability (A) Every request gets a response, even if some nodes fail. Partition Tolerance (P) The system keeps working despite network issues. Kafka is an AP system; it prioritizes Availability and Partition Tolerance, while consistency is eventual and tunable via settings. Now, let's get into the scenarios. Before going in-depth into scenarios, let's understand the key components and terminology of Kafka internals. As discussed in earlier sections, in a distributed network setup across geographic locations, network service interruptions can occur because no service guarantees 100% availability. This scenario focuses on WAN disruption between two regions, causing Kafka service unavailability, leaving the cluster with zero active controllers and no self-recovery, even after hours of waiting. Kafka is unavailable and can't be recovered on its own upon WAN service disruption and reestablishment and shows active controllers as '0' It's a "brain-dead" scenario. Upon WAN disruption, a single 4-node cluster becomes 2 independent clusters, each with 2 nodes. WAN disruption can be done by deleting or modifying route tables. Warning: Deleting a route table may disrupt all traffic in the associated subnets. Instead, consider modifying or detaching the route table. You may need to shut down firewalls Firewall status: systemctl status firewalld Firewall stop: service firewalld stop ZK Server start: bin/zookeeper-server-start etc/kafka/zookeeper.properties ZK Server stop: zookeeper-server-stop ZK Shell commands: bin/zookeeper-shell.sh <zookeeper host>:2181 Active controllers check: get /controller or ls /controller Brokers list: /home/opc/kafka/bin/zookeeper-shell kafkabrokeraddress:2181 <<<"ls /brokers/ids" Alternative to check controllers and brokers in a cluster. Available from kafka 3.7.x bin/kafka-metadata-shell.sh --bootstrap-server <KAFKA_BROKER>:9092 --describe-cluster Kafka is not available and can't be recovered on its own upon WAN service disruption and re-establishment and shows active controllers as '2' Kafka is not available and couldn't be recovered on its own upon and showed active controllers as '0' From the logs, observed disk-related errors and exceptions Logs show that the controller moved the exception from one broker to another broker, but no exit or hang was reported in the logs Controllers '0' behavior is equal to the brain-dead scenario explained in scenario 2. Killing broker and ZK processes (an uncontrolled shutdown can be comparable with machine abrupt reboot) and restarting brokers lead to corrupted indices, rebuilding indices doesn't work even after hours of waiting. This scenario is comparable to an ungraceful shutdown during an environment upgrade or to a poor security posture, where an unauthorized person could terminate the service. Kafka is not available and couldn't be recovered on its own. From the logs, 'index corrupted' logs for partitions are shown, and also 'rebuilding indices logs'. Rebuilding indices didn't work and doesn't show any related logs on progress. The resulting cluster is in unavailable status even after 1 hour. Also, it is recommended to do graceful shutdowns instead of using the kill switch or doing abrupt shutdowns so the data in the Kafka local cache will be flushed to the disks by maintaining meta data information and also committing offsets. Deploying on-premise stretch clusters requires a deep understanding of failure scenarios, particularly during network disruptions. Unlike cloud environments, on-premises setups may lack highly available network infrastructure, fault tolerance mechanisms, or dedicated fiber lines, making them more susceptible to outages. In such cases, a Kafka cluster may experience downtime if network connectivity is disrupted. Cloud providers, on the other hand, offer high-bandwidth, low-latency networking over fully redundant, dedicated metro fiber connections between regions and data centers. Their managed Kafka services are designed for high availability, typically recommending deployment across multiple zones or regions to withstand zonal failures. Additionally, these services incorporate zone-awareness features, ensuring Kafka data replication occurs across multiple zones, rather than being confined to a single one. It is also important to understand and emphasize the latency impact on a stretch cluster deployed in two different Geo locations with a WAN connection. We can not escape physics; in our case, as per WonderNetwork, the average latency between London and Frankfurt is 14.88 milliseconds for a distance of 636km. So, for mission-critical applications, the setup of a stretch cluster driven by latencies, through testing, is needed to determine how the data is being replicated and consumed across. By understanding these differences, organizations can make informed decisions about whether an on-premise stretch cluster aligns with their availability and resilience requirements or if a cloud-native Kafka deployment is a more suitable alternative. A Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is essential for any business to maintain its brand and reputation. Almost all the companies think of High Availability (HA) and Disaster recovery (DR) strategies to meet their BCP. Below are the popular DR Strategies for Kafka. Before we dive deep into DR strategies further, let's understand that the Kafka Mirror Maker 2.0 we are using in the following architectural patterns. There are other components like Kafka Connect, Replicator, etc., offered by Confluent and other cloud services, but they are out of scope for this article. DNS Redirection in Apache Kafka is a cross-cluster replication tool that uses the Kafka Connect framework to replicate topics between clusters, supporting active-active and active-passive setups. It provides automatic consumer group synchronization, offset translation, and failover support for disaster recovery and multi-region architectures. This is a popular DR strategy pattern where there will be two different Kafka clusters, which are of identical size & configuration, deployed in two different Geo regions or Data centers. In this case, it's the London and Frankfurt regions. Usually, Geo location choice depends upon Earth's different tectonic plates, company or country compliance and regulations requirements, and other factors. Out of which only one cluster is active at a given point of time, which receives and serves the clients. As shown in the following picture, Kafka cluster one (KC1) is located in the London region and Kafka cluster two (KC2) is located in the Frankfurt region with the same size and configuration. All the producers are producing data to KC1 (London region cluster), and all consumers are consuming the data from the same cluster. KC2 (Frankfurt region cluster) receives the data from the KC1 cluster through Mirror Maker as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Kafka Active Standby (aka Active Passive) cluster setup with Mirror role In simple terms, we can treat the mirror maker as a combination of producer and consumer, where it consumes the topics from the source cluster KC1 (London region) and produces the data to the destination cluster KC2 (Frankfurt region). During the disaster to the primary/active cluster KC1 (London region), the standby cluster (Frankfurt region) will become active, and all the producers and consumers' traffic redirected to the standby cluster. This can be achieved through DNS redirection via a load balancer in front of Kafka clusters. Fig 2 shows this scenario. Figure 2: Kafka Active Standby setup - Standby cluster becomes active When the London Region KC1 cluster becomes active, we need to set up a mirror maker instance to consume the data from the Frankfurt region cluster and produce back to it to the London region KC1 cluster. This scenario is shown in Fig. 3. It's up to the business to keep the Frankfurt region (KC2) active or promote the London region cluster (KC1) back to primary once the data is fully synced/hydrated to the current state. In some cases, the standby cluster, i.e., the Frankfurt region cluster (KC2), continues to function like an active cluster and the London region cluster (KC1) becomes the standby as well. It is essential to note that RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) values are high compared to the Active-Active setup. Active-standby setup cost is medium to high as we need to maintain the same Kafka clusters in both regions. Figure 3: Kafka Active Standby setup – Standby cluster data sync happening to the KC1 Kafka Mirror Maker Replication Lag (Δ): Let's take a scenario, and it might happen very rarely, where we lose all the cluster completely, including nodes and disks, etc. Where the Active Kafka Cluster (London region - KC1) has 'm' messages, and the mirror maker is consuming and producing to the standby cluster. Due to network latency or consumers & producing process with acknowledgements, the standby cluster (i.e., Frankfurt region - KC2) lags behind and holds only 'n' messages. Which means the delta(\(\Delta\)) is m minus n. \(\Delta = m - n\) where: Due to this replication lag (\(\Delta\)), it will have the following impact on mission-critical applications Potential Message Loss: If a failover occurs before the Standby cluster catches up, some messages (\(\Delta\)) may be missing. Inconsistent Data: Consumers relying on the Standby cluster may process incomplete or outdated data. Delayed Processing: Applications depending on real-time replication may experience latency in data availability. The replication lag concern can be overcome with the Active-Active setup. Just like the Active standby setup, we will have the same Kafka clusters deployed in the London and Frankfurt regions. The producers of the ingestion pipeline will write the data to both clusters at any given point in time. Which is also known as Dual Writes. So, both clusters' data is in sync as shown in Fig. 4. Please note that the ingestion pipeline or producers should have the capability to support dual writes. It is also important to note that these write pipelines should be isolated so that any issue with one cluster should not impact other pipelines or create back pressure and producer latencies. For example, if your use case is log analytics or observability, considering Logstash in your ingestion and creating two separate pipelines within a single or more Logstash instances will act as an isolated pipeline. But only one cluster is active for the consumers at any given point of time. Figure 4: Active-Active setup or Dual writes. In case, as shown in Figure 5, any issues with the one cluster the consumers need to be redirected with DNS redirect and RTO and RPO or SLAs are near zero. Figure 5: Active-Active setup, one cluster is unavailable Once the London cluster is available and becomes active, data can sync back to the London cluster from the Frankfurt cluster using Mirror Maker. As shown in Fig. 6, consumers can be switched back to the London cluster using DNS redirect. Also, it is important to configure consumer groups to start where they left off. During this setup, during the failover, it is important to configure consumers' offset to read the messages from a particular point in time, like reply messages from the last current time minus 15 mins, or set up a mirror maker between active clusters to read 'only' consumer offset topics from the London region cluster and replicate to the Frankfurt region cluster. And during the failure, you can use source.auto.offset.reset=latest to read the data from the latest offsets in the Frankfurt region cluster. If the consumer groups are not properly configured, you may see duplicate messages in your downstream system. So, it's essential to design the downstream to handle duplicate records. For example, if it's an observability use case and if the downstream is OpenSearch, it's good practice to design a unique ID depending on the message timestamp and other parameters like session IDs, etc. So, that duplicate message will overwrite the existing duplicate record and maintain only one record. Figure 6: Active-Active setup cluster syncing data with MirrorMaker Message ordering challenges occur when writing to two clusters simultaneously, messages may arrive in different orders due to network delays between regions. This can be particularly problematic for applications that require strict message ordering. So, it needs to be handled in the data processing time or downstream systems. For example, defining a primary key within the message body timestamp field would order the messages based on timestamps. Data Consistency Issues can occur while establishing dual writes to two different clusters. It requires robust monitoring and reconciliation processes to ensure data integrity across clusters. Because there might be conditions where data might successfully write to one cluster but fail in another, resulting in data inconsistency. Producer complexity is an issue in this active-active setup. Producers need to handle writing to two clusters and manage failures independently for each cluster, so isolation of each pipeline is important. This setup might increase the complexity of the producer applications and require more resources to manage dual writes effectively. There are some agents or tools in the market also as open-source offerings that will provide dual pipeline options such as Elastic Logstash. Consumer group management is complex. Managing consumer offsets across multiple clusters could be challenging, especially during failover scenarios, and can lead to message duplication. Consumer applications or downstream systems need to be designed to handle duplicate messages or implement deduplication logic. Operational Overhead - Running active-active clusters requires sophisticated monitoring tools and increases operational costs significantly. Teams need to maintain detailed runbooks and conduct regular disaster recovery drills to ensure smooth failover processes. Network Latency Considerations- Cross-region network latency and bandwidth costs become critical factors in active-active setups. Reliable network connectivity between regions is essential for maintaining data consistency and managing replication effectively. Backup and restore is a cost-effective architectural pattern compared to Active Standby(AP) or Active Active(AA) DR architectural patterns. It is suitable for non-critical applications with higher RTO and RPO values compared to AA or AP patterns. Backup and restore is a cost-effective option because we need only one Kafka cluster. In case the Kafka cluster is unavailable, the data from the centralized repository can be replayed/restored to the Kafka cluster once it becomes available. In this architectural pattern, shown in Figure 7, all the data will be saved to a persistent location like Amazon S3 or another data lake, where the data can be restored/replayed to the Kafka cluster when the Kafka cluster is available. It is also common to see a new environment of Kafka clusters built together using terraform templates and build a new Kafka cluster and replay data. Figure 7: Backup and restore architectural pattern Recovery time impact is a major consideration; Restoring (aka replaying) large volumes of data to Kafka can take significant time, resulting in a higher RTO. This makes it suitable only for applications that can tolerate longer downtimes. Data consistency challenges are also an issue. When restoring data from backup storage like Amazon S3, maintaining the exact message ordering and partitioning as the original cluster can be challenging. Special attention is needed to ensure data consistency during restoration. Backup performance overhead is a further consideration. Regular backups to external storage can impact the performance of the production cluster. The backup process needs careful scheduling and resource management to minimize impact on production workloads. Storage is key. Managing large volumes of backup data requires effective storage lifecycle policies and controlling costs. Regular cleanup of old backups and efficient storage utilization strategies are essential. Coordination during recovery is mandatory. The recovery process requires careful coordination between backing up offset information and actual messages. Missing either can lead to message loss or duplication during restoration. As we explored earlier, choosing a DR strategy isn't one-size-fits-all, it comes with trade-offs. It often boils down to finding the right balance between what the business needs and what it can afford. The decision usually depends on several factors. SLAs (e.g., 99.99%+ uptime) are pre-defined commitments to uptime and availability. An SLA requiring 99.99% uptime allows only 52.56 minutes of downtime per year. The RTO metric is used to define the maximum acceptable downtime for a system or application after a failure before it causes unacceptable business harm. Knowledge/content/training systems, for example, can expect one hour or more downtime because they are not mission critical. For banking applications, on the other hand, downtime acceptance could be none or a couple of minutes. The RPO metric is used to define the maximum acceptable amount of data loss during a disruptive event, measured in time from the most recent backup. For example, an observability/monitoring application can have the acceptability for losing the past hour whereas a financial application can not tolerate losing a single record of transaction data. Associated costs vary. Higher availability and faster recovery typically come at a higher price. Organizations must weigh their need for uptime and data protection against the financial investment required. References: A round-up of last week’s content on InfoQ sent out every Tuesday.

Title: The 2025 Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs List

BySeth Matlins, Forbes Staff. Not ha-ha funny but rather the hard-to-define, hard-to-precisely-quantify, kind of funny, like how the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is funny. In our world, which is to say the world of business globally and marketing specifically, influence often hides-in-plain-sight, and can be confused with visibility, or a type of popularity measured by follower counts, “likes”, or the stuff of performative thought leadership. And while these can provide and be platform for the exercise of influence, in and of themselves, they’re not proof of it. They’re optics, and as the unreliable testimony of an eye-witness proves, optics can distort. The most influential CMOs are not necessarily those posting or speaking on panels most often. Theirs often isn’t the loudest voice in the room, because sometimes like that not done that not said speaks volumes. As we at Forbes consider the evolving nature, impact, and measurement of influence, we offer that nothing is as influential as impact. We are certain that the ultimate measure of influence is not about the spotlight but a CMO’s commercial impact on the business and brands they help steward, and the marketing community globally. We are certain the most effective exercise of a CMO’s influence lies in their ability to change the attitudes and behaviors of others—the “consumers” and “customers” they court externally and, as surely, their C-suite colleagues and teams internally. We know that not every job brilliantly done necessarily gets recognition, and that the measure and impact of a CMO’s influence amongst their global peers—the kind that moves markets, companies, culture, and behaviors in service of commercial returns—doesn’t always announce itself. Which is why, in partnership with Sprinklr and with supplemental data provided by LinkedIn, we take a broad, multifaceted, rigorous, and data-led approach to our evaluation. Beginning with an eligible universe of over 1500 CMOs from industries around the world, using 20 proxies for it, and through an analysis of 10 billion data points (up from 9 billion YoY), we concern ourselves with what can be seen, understood, and evaluated. (For more detail on the methodology—including our 20+ indicators of influence, the data sources and scoring frameworks—see Sprinklr’s companion report here.) Of course, like the job of the CMO itself, the nature of influence itself continues evolving. As marketing authority becomes ever more decentralized, distributed, and democratized, so too does CMO influence. That which once flowed top-down, is now networked, lateral, circular, ambient. The tools of marketing influence are now in everyone’s hands, sentient and not. Brand-building and, sometimes brand-tearing-down, has become a shared exercise among stakeholders inside and outside any given company—across the C-suite, business units, customer support, comms, operations, employee advocacy, and every keyboard with or without a corporate login. All of this and the shifting sands of consumer sentiment, tech acceleration, geopolitical unrest, economic uncertainty, the absence of understanding of what marketing truly is and does from CEOs and CFOs without experience in the practice, cultural fragmentation and 1000 other things, makes the effective deployment of a CMO’s influence more complex than ever. It also makes the achievement of being recognized on a list measuring it even more meaningful. The 50 chief marketers on the 2025 Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs list, along with the six 2025 Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees, are shaping the companies they serve, the character and destiny of industry, and in ways that might not yet be recognizable, the world itself. They are influencing others through word, work, actions, inactions, culture, peers, platforms, partnerships, and impacts—not hierarchy. They aren’t just influencing what a brand says but shaping how a company thinks, what it does, and when, why, and how often others buy. They aren’t just steering creative—they’re stewarding growth. They’re leading from the center, even if their titles—and/or CEOs and Boards—don’t always put them there. Individually and collectively, their influence and impact deserve our appreciation, and their examples our consideration. The Forbes CMO Hall of Fame The 2025 Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees represent the fourth class since the Hall’s inaugural one in 2022. Created to recognize those chief marketers who, in 2022, had or in all subsequent years, would have, appeared on our World’s Most Influential CMOs list five times. Given the massive changes to the landscape in which these CMOs compete and operate, being recognized on this Forbes list five times is an extraordinary achievement and testimony to their talents and contributions. Entering 2025, ten chief marketers had been recognized on the list four times previously and were thus eligible for induction. Of these ten, it is our privilege to induct six into the Forbes CMO Hall of Fame Class of 2025. These six join the 20 chief marketers inducted previously, each and all of whom are recognized for the enduring influence and impact they’ve had on the brands and businesses they’ve led, on our industry, commerce, and, often, on the cultural landscape itself. Read more about this year’s Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees, as well as those from prior years, here. The Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs List: 2025 Marian Lee CMO of one of the world’s most culturally influential brands, and the largest entertainment company by market cap, Lee’s work has global visibility and influence. The breadth of her remit includes full responsibility across the streamer’s global and local campaigns, experiential activations, social storytelling, and brand partnerships in support of Netflix’s scaling advertising business. With a nearly $2 billion annual advertising budget, Lee’s work plays a pivotal role in shaping how and where Netflix shows up for the audiences of its TV series, films, reality competitions, sports, and gaming efforts. No longer just a content platform, Netflix has become a brand with massive influence over how people’s time, attention and conversation is focused. Over the past year, Lee and her team launched massive integrated campaigns for the NFL including “The Beyonce Bowl,” returning mega-franchises like “Squid Game” and multi-national favorites including “Bad Influence.” Lee’s conviction that one size does not fit all and that “fans don’t just want to watch a show, they want to live it,” drives a strategy designed to blur the boundary between viewer and participant; as a result, Netflix’s marketing events, from immersive fan experiences to location takeovers, including their tentpole Tudum fan-festival, have become cultural moments in their own right. Her fan-first, culture-forward approach is helping drive not just tune-in but momentum across Netflix’s advertising business, which now has 94 million monthly active users, an increase of 20 million since just November. Lee is only the third CMO to be recognized as number one on this list in consecutive years. As of June 6th, the company’s stock was up over 93% year-over-year (YoY). New Balance Davis’s influence is shaping more than a brand but also a category in flux. Responsible for New Balance’s brand strategy, product and demand creation initiatives around the globe, Davis is driving the company’s cultural relevance and commercial returns by elevating the brand’s appeal and affinity through global creative, unexpected partnerships, and consumer-focused commercial strategies. The privately held company’s brand ascension and approach have become a case study across the broader marketing community, as Davis has positioned New Balance as a global challenger brand—one equally credible on the runway, in the locker room, and on the street. Davis’s marketing framework prioritizes long-term cultural resonance over short-term hype: In the past year, the brand expanded its global footprint with talent and storytelling that span both performance and lifestyle. A mix of collaborations both short and long-term—from Shohei Ohtani to Loro Piana, Miu Miu, Coco Gauff, Bayer Leverkusen, and number one NBA draft choice Cooper Flagg—demonstrate a values-based approach to partners and the diverse audiences they reach while reinforcing New Balance’s selective distribution strategy, all of which serve to elevate brand perception globally. In FY2024, New Balance reported a record $7.8 billion in revenue, marking its fourth consecutive year of 20%+ growth. Asmita Dubey Dubey leads brand strategy, digital innovation and consumer engagement globally for the world’s largest beauty company and its portfolio of brands, including category icons like L’Oréal Paris, Maybelline and Lancôme. Overseeing a marketing budget exceeding €13 billion annually, Dubey has deepened L’Oréal’s commitment to “beauty tech” by integrating AI-powered diagnostics, virtual try-ons and personalized routines across key brands. Such tools have significantly enhanced customer engagement, with the company reporting over one billion virtual try-ons across its portfolio. Dubey’s influence is evident not just in the growth of the French conglomerate, but the behaviors of the category worldwide. In the past year, L’Oréal launched CREAITECH, an in-house generative AI beauty content lab, announcing a partnership with Nvidia to super-charge it with never seen before beauty experiences, just last week. Dubey has also partnered with Google to integrate its Imagen 3, Gemini and Veo 2 AI models into CREAITECH, creating some 50,000 images and 500 videos monthly, streamlining content production and allowing for rapid localization of marketing materials. Dubey has also transformed L’Oréal’s influencer marketing strategy, expanding collaborations to over 60,000 creators: The extensive network has contributed to L’Oréal achieving a 30% share of global beauty influence. L’Oréal Paris was again the leading beauty brand on social media last year and closedQ1 2025 with a 4.4% increase in sales YoY. Marcel Marcondes Marcondes has influence and oversight over the world’s largest brewer—parent to eight of the 10 most valuable beer brands worldwide, including Corona, Budweiser, and Michelob Ultra—spanning more than 500 brands sold in over 150 countries. With a conviction that creativity is most impactful when applied to solving business and consumer problems, Marcondes ensures the company’s marketing engine drives volume through brand equity, creativity and culture amidst changing consumer attitudes and behaviors. While the company’s portfolio is huge, Marcondes focuses on a “megabrand” strategy, which concentrates marketing investments behind a select group of scalable, emotionally resonant labels in order to build premium stature and global brand consistency. As but one illustration, over the past year, Marcondes’s vision has materialized in the global rollout of Corona Cero, the company’s alcohol-free variant, in more than 40 markets ahead of the Paris Olympics. Marcondes has also broadened the reach of AB InBev’s CreativeX system, a Cannes-modeled internal training and recognition platform that is reported to have measurably improved marketing quality, effectiveness, and creative confidence across regional teams. In June, and for an unprecedented fourth consecutive year, AB InBev was named the world’s most effective marketer by The Effies. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up more than 42% YTD. David Sandstrom Sandström is rewriting the rules of marketing and marketing organization design in the AI era for the Swedish fintech giant, which serves over 150 million users in some 45 countries around the world. With oversight of Klarna’s global brand, creative and consumer strategy, Sandström’s remit also extends into full-stack operational reinvention. Sandström isn’t just using AI to optimize workflows; he’s building an entirely new model for how marketing teams think, create and move at scale, and the broader marketing world is paying attention. Under his leadership, Klarna has embedded generative AI across every stage of its marketing process—what Sandström calls “AI copilots”—with more than 300 custom GPT-powered tools for everything from ideation to insight generation, enabling Klarna’s marketers to function like engineers—faster, leaner, and more iterative than ever before. Through such innovations, Sandström and his team have reduced image production costs by 50% and cut campaign development timelines from six weeks to days, helping save millions annually in sales and marketing spend, while transforming a transactional payments platform into one of the most culturally agile and technologically advanced brands in finance. Sandström’s work has also helped shift the brand from financial utility to cultural relevance. This past March, Klarna partnered with DoorDash to bring its flexible payment tools to everyday categories like grocery and meal delivery, reframing buy now, pay later as a convenience driver, not just a credit alternative. Sandström has helped Klarna become a brand that moves with culture, not behind it. In 2024, the company reported revenues had increased 24% YoY. Asad Ayaz With three titles and three distinct but integrated remits, Ayaz holds one of the most influential marketing roles in entertainment, and shapes how Disney shows up across culture, commerce and marketing storytelling. With oversight spanning global brand strategy, digital engagement, franchise synergy and marketing across Disney’s core content engines—including Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios, and Disney+, in the past year, Ayaz brought together Disney’s two internal creative agencies, Yellow Shoes and The Hive to unify brand and experiences campaigns across parks, streaming, and theatrical content—just as Disneyland enters its 70th anniversary year. He also led the buzz-heavy campaign for “Deadpool & Wolverine,” reframing the R-rated entry as a cultural reset for Marvel with Comic-Con stunts, K-pop integrations, and irreverent global storytelling. Other standout moments include the viral “Apes on Horses” activation for “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” the integrated Hulu-on-Disney+ campaign that merged iconic franchise quotes with surprise character crossovers, and a reimagined D23 fan event that expanded into Fortnite and debuted globally in Brazil. With three billion-dollar films and over $5 billion in global box office, as of June 6, Disney stock was up more than 12% YoY. Tim Ellis With oversight of brand strategy, fan engagement, content and international growth, Ellis leads marketing for one of the world's most influential sports leagues, and the most dominant sports and media property in the U.S. Overseeing a cross-functional team spanning marketing, social, partnerships, media and international, Ellis is focused on bringing new audiences to the game, growing the league’s global reach and ensuring its continued cultural relevance. In the past year, his influence extends across marketing for the NFL's most ambitious international slate to date, as international outreach included regular-season games in São Paulo, Madrid, Dublin, Berlin and London. To recruit, retain and engage fans, Ellis deploys a “helmets off” strategy, one that has been emulated by other leagues, in order to humanize and personalize the game’s biggest names. Under his influence, campaigns have gone beyond the game and sport itself and have included those spotlighting mental health and youth empowerment. The League’s “Every Kid Can Be Somebody” campaign aired during the AFC and NFC Championships and Super Bowl LIX and was one the showcase’s best received and reviewed spots. These efforts, along with others like growing category interest and participation by championing flag football, support the league’s push to build emotional resonance with fans across generations and geographies. Just weeks ago, the League announced NFL players could play in Flag Football’s Olympic Games debut in 2028. The business results speak volumes: for the 2024 fiscal year, the NFL’s total revenue is reported to have grown 13% YoY. Kofi-Amoo-Gottfried Amoo-Gottfried’s influence is reshaping DoorDash—which currently has a dominant 60% share in the U.S. meal delivery market and is aggressively expanding international operations—into a cultural and commercial powerhouse. With an expansive remit leading the company’s brand strategy, creative, media and customer engagement, expanding category awareness and brand affinity are among the areas where Amoo-Gottfried’s influence is most visible. His approach blends cultural fluency with performance rigor and reflects a conviction that "a brand is the sum of all interactions and associations that people have with your product, service, company.” Focused on redefining how the company’s three principal constituencies—consumers, providers and delivery Dashers—think about the brand he stewards, Amoo-Gottfried has helped embed DoorDash as a part of daily life for tens of millions around the world. For the twelve months ending March 31, 2025, the company handled over 2.6 billion orders, reflecting YoY growth of 19%; and in May, DoorDash announced its agreement to acquire U.K.-based Deliveroo for £2.9 billion ($3.86 billion USD), expanding its reach to over 40 countries. As of the close of markets on June 6, the company’s stock was up over 92% YoY. Colin Fleming Fleming is responsible for the global marketing strategy and growing brand recognition worldwide for the $230 billion enterprise software behemoth, with a global remit spanning brand, demand, content, and events. Over the past year and since becoming CMO, Fleming has overhauled the company’s marketing engine, driving a shift from a product-first mindset to a bold, brand-led strategy, elevating storytelling, cultural relevance and emotional resonance in a category not traditionally known for the same. This repositioning, and the approach surrounding it, has included halving the company’s agency roster (an initiative named internally after Marie Kondo to reinforce the joy and efficacy of less) while doubling down on global activations with audience-relevant cultural currency. Under his leadership, marketing has become a strategic partner to the sales organization, rather than the lead factory it had long been. Fleming is helping position ServiceNow as not just a category leader, but a cultural force. His influence extends beyond the company and is found in his recent provocation to the B2B marketing world at large, arguing that it is time enterprise marketers stop marketing with fact-deficient, obfuscating generalities and attribution models and start marketing to humans again, including ditching acronym-heavy language in favor of customer clarity. Kantar recently named Service Now the 41st most valuable brand globally, representing a 57% increase in brand value YoY. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up over 47% in the past year. Lennard Hoornik Over the past year, Hoornik orchestrated one of the most attention-getting brand refreshes globally and is steering both Jaguar and Land Rover through high-stakes transformations. With oversight of the British multi-national company’s global sales, marketing, brand positioning and customer experience, Hoornik’s remit is central to JLR's "Reimagine" strategy, which aims to redefine modern luxury in an automotive category being reshaped by electrification. Hoornik led the much-discussed rebranding of Jaguar, signaling a clean break from the brand’s heritage cues and launching the provocative “Copy Nothing” platform. The campaign, which debuted in two phases with a teaser trailer, immersive installations at Miami Art Week, strategic influencer drops, and a media buy spanning art, design, and tech publications, introduced the company’s Type 00 concept car: a low-slung, all-electric grand tourer embodying Jaguar’s new design philosophy. The rebranding sparked controversy and ignited global discourse, nowhere more than in the marketing world. Discourse aside, the move anchors Jaguar’s plan to go fully electric by 2026 and recalibrate toward design-led, next-gen luxury. Under Hoornik’s marketing leadership, and driven by strong demand and sharper brand differentiation, in FY25 JLR posted record Q3 results, its ninth successive profitable quarter. Claudine Cheever At the helm of marketing for the world’s largest retailer, Cheever oversees 11 global functional teams spanning brand, media, measurement, creative and insights, powering Amazon’s connection with hundreds of millions of customers across an increasingly diversified portfolio, from Prime and retail to healthcare and AI. Cheever has continued pushing Amazon’s massive owned ecosystem—boxes, trucks, devices—as a media platform, creating one of the largest and most efficient out-of-home networks on the planet. Under her marketing influence and leadership, Amazon’s in-house agency was named Ad Age’s 2024 In-House Agency of the Year, reflecting work that balances performance rigor with scaled brand storytelling. This includes emotionally led campaigns like 2024’s “Midnight Opus,” which aired across the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Japan. Cheever is also steering brand expansion into sectors like pharmacy and telehealth, where trust and clarity are critical to adoption. With an annual budget in the billions, she’s building a high-impact global marketing engine that flexes to local markets. Amazon’s brand value rose 50% year-over-year in Kantar’s latest rankings, making it the fourth most valuable brand globally; as of the close of markets on June 3, Amazon’s stock was up nearly 17% YoY. Pinteres With a remit spanning marketing, communications, insights and product design, Mallard is shaping Pinterest, one of the world’s most popular social media brands, into the rarest kind of platform: one that grows by making the internet feel better, not louder. Mallard’s remit is unusually broad and deep, as she leads an integrated product, design, research & insights, marketing, communications and creative team to deliver exceptional end-to-end customer experiences. Her influence across the company and category is equally expansive, helping Pinterest become a case study in how to scale without compromising trust or values: With some 570 million global monthly active users, the platform has had so great a surge in Gen Z engagement that the user segment is now the fastest growing and most active in Pinterest’s history. Over the past year, Mallard has advanced Pinterest’s “positive personalization” strategy, leveraging AI and design to surface relevant content tailored for individual users without triggering the social comparison loops that plague much of social media. This ethos of prioritizing utility over virality continues setting Pinterest apart as other social platforms face heightened scrutiny over mental health impacts, misinformation and aggressive monetization tactics. Mallard also continued to evolve Pinterest Predicts, transforming it from an annual trend report into a dynamic business intelligence tool that not only forecasts but increasingly fuels advertiser strategy across fashion, beauty, home and retail sectors. The result: marketers are using Pinterest not just to see what’s coming next, but to act on it. In Q1 2025, Pinterest reported a 16% YoY revenue increase. Frank-Cooper Cooper is redefining the role of marketing at Visa—the world’s largest payments network, facilitating over $12 trillion in annual volume—and the financial services sector broadly. Overseeing brand strategy, global campaigns and customer engagement across more than 200 countries, Cooper’s influence is witnessed in his work to evolve the positioning of the iconic brand from a transaction facilitator to a catalyst for economic empowerment. In the past year, Cooper used the high-profile Oscars telecast to launch Visa’s global Typewriter campaign, a narrative-driven initiative that reimagines Visa’s role in enabling personal growth and opportunity—aligning with the brand’s “Everywhere You Want To Be” ethos by positioning Visa as a partner not just in purchases but in the milestones, ambitions and life moments those purchases make possible. The campaign marked new territory for Visa by leaning into emotionally resonant storytelling that shows how its products, including Visa Direct and Visa Installments, can help people reach personal goals. And while the company’s product teams developed innovations like Visa Intelligent Commerce and Flexible Credential, Cooper has shaped how they’re positioned and marketed globally, framing them as tools that make everyday commerce more personal, intelligent and secure. These strategic efforts have reinforced Visa’s category dominance, and its global market share is nearly double that of its nearest traditional competitor. In Q2 2025, the company reported a 9% YoY revenue increase, and as of June 6, the company’s stock is up more than 32% YoY. Zach Kitschke Instrumental in steering Canva’s evolution from a consumer-first platform to an enterprise-grade design and productivity suite, Kitschke has helped lead the company’s shift into its next growth frontier: B2B and enterprise teams. Since joining the Australian company as its fifth employee, Kitschke has overseen brand, communications, product marketing and go-to-market efforts, shaping how Canva promotes a design-led ethos and scales its influence globally. Over the past year, he drove the launch of Canva’s largest brand campaign to date, “Love Your Work,” reframing design as a daily advantage for any professional, not just creative ones. Timed to coincide with a major platform overhaul and the introduction of new collaboration and brand management features for business teams across marketing, HR, and sales, Kitschke has also led Canva's expansion into non-traditional sectors including education and nonprofits, all supporting a broader community-led growth strategy, and has influenced company efforts to ensure product storytelling and customer insights are aligned. The privately-held company with a valuation near $50 billion, now has 170 million users across 190 countries. Over the past year, the company passed $3B in revenues for the first time, and Kitschke’s influence helped contribute to Canva’s reported 35% revenue increase YoY. Noel Mack Mack isn’t just steering Gymshark’s growth; he is helping architect it. A driving force behind one of the world’s most dynamic apparel brands and one of the U.K.’s only “unicorns,” Mack is helping transform Gymshark into a global brand and business by blending cultural and consumer savvy with an approach redefining the balance and interplay between the digital and physical. While other brands chase broad lifestyle relevance, under Mack’s lead, Gymshark remains unapologetically focused on just one thing: the gym. With a community-and-social-first mindset, Mack’s work finds the brand becoming something of a movement among Gen Z and Millennial consumers for whom going to the gym is not just a routine but an identity. With influence over all brand, marketing, creative and consumer-facing strategies, Mack has been building both the brand and business on social media and with creator partnerships long before they became industry standards. His early embrace of digital community-building wasn’t just a marketing decision; it was and is a business engine. When the brand’s recent release of its cult-status Onyx collection was hijacked by bots, Mack led Gymshark’s response with nothing but the consumer in mind, turning what could have been a crisis into another chapter in its storied community-building work. Gymshark’s "We Do Gym" platform reflects Mack’s laser-focused brand philosophy; while competitors expand laterally into lifestyle categories, Mack keeps Gymshark's identity ruthlessly specific, making it more resonant, not less. That clarity, paired with grassroots digital storytelling, has set a new standard for how brands build relevance without traditional advertising. In FY2025, the privately held company reported a revenue increase of over 9% YoY, and a bootstrapped valuation now exceeding $1.5 billion.

Under her marketing leadership, culturally attuned work like the U.K.’s “Gift of McDonald’s” holiday spot—directed by Gold Lion award-winner and Danish film-maker Nicolai Fuglsig—was named one of best campaigns of the year, showcasing how locally rooted storytelling can elevate brand meaning and emotional connection at scale. Beyond brand building, Graham-Clare is scaling loyalty and digital engagement through app-based experiences, limited-edition merch drops, and real-time activations meeting customers where they are. Graham-Clare is helping ensure that the iconic global brand stays emotionally relevant, digitally fluent, and locally loved. As of June 6, the company’s stock is up nearly 20% YoY. Charlie Smith Smith’s influence is redefining what luxury marketing looks and sounds like in the modern age—and how luxury brands behave across culture. In steering the LVMH-owned Spanish fashion house (and one of the world’s oldest luxury brands) into a new era, Smith is elevating Loewe’s profile and creating a new playbook for luxury storytelling, blending high-craft heritage with an internet-native wit not typical for luxury brands. Under his marketing leadership, Loewe has become one of fashion’s most digitally fluent and culturally resonant brands, known as much for its ironic tone and sharp social media presence as for its meticulous craftsmanship and bold creative direction. Smith oversees all aspects of Loewe’s brand and consumer communication, leading a global team across marketing, digital, PR, events and celebrity/influencer strategy. His remit spans traditional brand building and future-facing cultural invention — from the recent Crafted World exhibition in Tokyo (a multi-sensory showcase of Loewe’s craftsmanship that drew tens of thousands of reservations in days) to the brand’s viral TikTok strategy, which has attracted a new generation of fans. Loewe’s campaigns now regularly feature a mix of high-fashion polish and unexpected levity, including casting creators and memes alongside red-carpet celebrities, resulting in both virality and brand heat. The impact has been both reputational and financial: Loewe is one of the fastest-growing brands in the LVMH portfolio and, in the first quarter of 2025, sat atop the influential Lyst Index.

Nicole-Hubbard-Graham Since rejoining Nike in early 2024, Graham has led the brand’s marketing revival at a moment of existential reckoning. After years of revenue declines, stalled innovation, and an overcorrection toward direct-to-consumer sales and performance marketing, Nike is reorienting around brand storytelling, and Graham has been central to that pivot. She helped conceive and lead the “Winning Isn’t for Everyone” campaign, a bold return to high-impact, athlete-driven storytelling that launched around the Summer Olympics and culminated in Nike’s first Super Bowl appearance in 27 years. The work marked a decisive shift back to the brand’s competitive DNA, earning widespread acclaim and restoring creative credibility. In May, Graham was promoted to EVP and CMO, expanding her remit to include oversight of storytelling across the Nike, Jordan, and Converse brands. She’s also deepening integration with product and design teams to reestablish cultural heat across categories.

Campaigns like “Shades of Red” in Mexico—honoring Coca-Cola’s century-long partnership with local small businesses—and Powerade’s “Pause is Power” films, starring Spanish and Brazilian soccer stars Lamine Yamal and Rodrygo Goes, reflect Arroyo’s emphasis on human-centered storytelling that connects globally and hyper-locally.

Bracey’s helped accelerate Unilever’s adoption of AI-powered “digital twins”—virtual replicas of products used to simulate packaging, claims, and creative in-market before launch—cutting production costs by up to 55% and slashing campaign development timelines by 65%. This tech-forward pivot is freeing creative teams to focus on high-impact storytelling while ensuring consistency, speed and cost-efficiency at scale. Bracey also introduced and scaled Unilever’s new “Culture to Cart” strategy—an end-to-end approach that fuses brand storytelling with frictionless commerce. The model is designed to convert cultural moments directly into sales by linking campaigns to omnichannel buying paths. Recent executions include Dove’s Serum Shower launch, which paired wellness influencers with live-streamed tutorials and one-click product links; and Hellmann’s 2025 U.S. Super Bowl campaign, extending a broadcast ad to interactive recipe content, TikTok partnerships and integrations on Instacart, Walmart and Amazon.

For the quarter ending February 2025, the company reported YoY revenue increase of more than 5%. Sophia Colucci The architect of Molson Coors’s North American marketing transformation, Colucci leads brand strategy, creative, innovation, insights, digital and experiential across a portfolio that spans core beer giants like Coors Light and Miller Lite, heritage labels like Blue Moon and Coors Banquet, and a fast-expanding slate of spirits and non-alcoholic offerings. At the world’s fourth-largest brewer, Colucci has helped reposition the company as a more modern, culturally fluent beverage player, sharpening its creative edge and deepening its relevance across generations. In early 2025, Colucci transformed a deliberate misspelling in Coors Light's advertising—"Refershment" instead of "Refreshment"—into a multifaceted Super Bowl campaign. Embracing the concept of a "Case of the Mondays," the campaign featured limited-edition "Mondays Light" packaging, a Peloton partnership, and viral merchandise like the "Chill Face Roller," resonating with consumers experiencing post-Super Bowl sluggishness. The campaign culminated in a Super Bowl ad starring sloths navigating a slow Monday. Colucci also spearheaded a collaboration between Coors Banquet and Wrangler to produce "Beer Wash Jeans,” a limited-edition denim infused with Banquet beer that features co-branded details. This move reinforced Banquet’s Western heritage and contributed to its third consecutive year of growth. Looking ahead, she's orchestrating a U.S. relaunch of Peroni, including domestic production and a campaign tied to Formula 1 and its 0.0% alcohol offering. Under Colucci’s marketing leadership, Molson Coors continues sharpening its creative standards and pushing into new categories. in Q1 2025, the company reported sales had increased over 4% YoY. Will Brass Brass has helped the Premier League become a magnet for the world’s most iconic brands, deepening the cultural reach of the game well beyond the pitch. Overseeing all global commercial partnerships and media rights, he’s the architect behind the return of Coca-Cola as Official Soft Drink Partner starting in the 2025/26 season, a wide-ranging deal activating across Coke’s top brands and delivering exclusive fan experiences across the UK and Ireland. Just ahead of that, he helped secure the league’s first-ever global beer partnership with Guinness, a four-year agreement launching in the 2024/25 season and tapping into the brand’s storytelling prowess to amplify match-day rituals worldwide. With games now broadcast into 900 million homes across 189 countries, Brass’s commercial playbook continues to elevate the Premier League as both a sport and a global entertainment property. That strategy is paying off: League revenue rose 4.1% over the previous year, with commercial income rising 9% year-over-year thanks to expanded sponsorships and global activations. Bernd Körber At BMW, the world’s third most valuable car brand and a global benchmark for luxury automotive performance, Korber is redefining how brand and product come together to shape the future of driving. With oversight of global brand strategy, portfolio planning and experiential innovation, he’s integrated marketing and product development into a single strategic pipeline, ensuring every model, from concept to showroom, is built not just to perform, but to tell a compelling, values-driven story. This philosophy was on full display with the recent debut of the BMW Concept Speedtop at Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este. Positioned at the crossroads of heritage and modernity, the shooting brake design blended performance engineering with elegant craftsmanship, including bespoke Schedoni luggage, while Koerber made headlines by confirming a limited production run of 70 units. At CES, Korber also unveiled the Vision Neue Klasse X and next-gen iDrive platform, showcasing how BMW is merging generative AI, adaptive UX, and immersive in-car entertainment to define mobility's emotional, digital future. Korber’s product-led brand strategy—where each launch functions as both a technological showcase and brand statement—has helped modernize BMW’s tone and broaden its appeal. The approach is delivering results: in Q1 2025, BMW posted record EV sales (up 27.9% YoY) and, as of June 6, the company’s stock was up nearly 10% YTD. Lisa McKnight McKnight is steering Mattel’s transformation from toymaker to IP-powered cultural force, redefining how legacy brands thrive. She has oversight of global brand strategy, creative, insights and licensing across the company’s entire portfolio, including for iconic brands like Barbie, Hot Wheels, UNO and Masters of the Universe. Under McKnight’s leadership, Mattel has adopted a newly flattened, collaborative model that fuses marketing, media, and design from the earliest stages, resulting in integrated brand narratives that build brand equity by updating the cultural context in which the individual equities show up. From viral Ken doll moments—such as the LeBron James “Kenbassador” collaboration—and Barbie’s art-world crossovers, to Hot Wheels’ limited-edition drops with artists like Daniel Arsham and MSCHF, and UNO’s resurgence fueled by TikTok debates and creator house rules, McKnight’s fan-first, multi-platform strategy taps into nostalgia with fresh creative energy. The result is a slate of reimagined brands that feel both timely and resonant, telling new stories that connect across generations. Her push into experiential marketing, design-driven collectibles via Mattel Creations, and premium brand partnerships has unlocked new revenue streams and pop culture traction, especially among kidults, who are now the company’s fastest-growing audience. In a market where many brands are retreating, McKnight is advancing Mattel’s brand purpose by repositioning toys as art objects, cultural statements, and vehicles for self-expression. As of June 2, Mattel’s stock was up 4% YoY. Elizabeth Rutledge With oversight of the iconic financial services brand’s global brand strategy, media, sponsorships, and customer marketing, Rutledge’s influence has sharpened the company’s all-important brand and identity around service, trust and small business support. Under her marketing influence and leadership, American Express has been building on a legacy purpose-led strategy to drive deeper customer connection and brand differentiation, extended its longstanding support of small businesses with grants delivered through their “Backing Small” platform, helping thousands of independent businesses rebuild from natural disasters and grow for the future. Over the past year, Rutledge has also continued advancing American Express’s presence in sports and entertainment with efforts that serve both B2C and B2B interests, including the brand’s high-visibility F1 Academy partnership, which spotlights women-owned businesses; and a revitalized NBA All-Star experience, including the debut of the company sponsored Community All-Star Award. Beyond cultural moments, Rutledge is ensuring American Express continues showing up in times of need, most recently by coordinating with Hilton to provide 20,000-plus free room nights to wildfire evacuees and first responders in California. The company closed Q1 2025 reporting a revenue increase of 9% YoY, and as of June 6, its stock was up 30% YTD. Mayur-Gupta Gupta is helping Kraken, a crypto-trading platform, usher in the age of crypto consumerism—at scale. As the company evolves from their origins into a full-fledged financial services brand, Gupta is steering a marketing strategy that’s equal parts performance engine and brand storyteller. At the heart of his approach is a product-led growth model tied tightly to data: Every user cohort, funnel stage and lifecycle trigger is measured, tested and optimized to drive accountable growth. This discipline has built trust internally, unlocking the ability to invest in brand-building moves that defy easy quantification, and ranging from emotional storytelling to high-profile cultural moments, like Kraken’s partnership with UEFA Europa League champions Tottenham Hotspur. His remit spans the entire marketing stack, blending PLG, lifecycle, performance and brand to create a unified growth system that resonates with crypto natives and newcomers alike. In the last year, Kraken’s revenues increased 128%. Patricia-Corsi Blending creative audacity with sharp commercial instincts, Corsi is reshaping how Kimberly-Clark’s iconic brands show up in the world. Under Corsi’s marketing leadership, the $20 billion global consumer goods giant—home to category leaders like Huggies, Kleenex, Kotex, and Poise—has seen its marketing engine evolve from a traditional, regionally siloed model to a more unified, creativity-led global one. Corsi has driven the company’s largest U.S. expansion in three decades while championing standout work that fused purpose and performance, like Huggies’s emotionally charged North American campaign with NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo celebrating everyday parenting wins. Poise confronted healthcare inequality with its powerful “Drops of Hope” initiative, and Kotex deepened its global effort to dismantle period stigma through locally resonant storytelling. Under Corsi’s influence, the company has retooled its global creative model to better unite design, brand-building, and business outcomes. Her ethos reflects a culture shift where high-impact creative, not hierarchy, leads decision-making. As of June 2, Kimberly Clark’s stock price was up 5% YoY. Jill_Hazelbaker Hazelbaker is steering one of the world’s most recognizable and widely used tech brands through a new era of reputation, regulation and relevance across the company’s ride-hailing platform, delivery services and freight transport operations. Hazelbaker leads an integrated marketing function designed to ensure Uber shows up with one consistent voice across audiences and markets, and brings marketing, communications and public policy together—a rare structure among global tech firms. Over the past year, Hazelbaker led the launch of Uber’s first global brand platform, “On Our Way.” Debuting during the Paris Olympics with a 90-second in-house spot and a new sonic identity unifying the company’s rideshare and delivery businesses, the campaign marked a continuing shift in Uber’s marketing from more tactical, product-led messaging to emotionally resonant storytelling speaking to riders, regulators and the press alike. Her leadership and influence reflect a broader brand evolution, reframing Uber from a transactional service to an essential part of everyday life. For the quarter ending in March, Uber reported revenues had increased nearly 14% YoY. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up over 35% YTD.

Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over two years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. And its stock price soared. During that period, the world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in all sorts of startups but particularly in AI startups. The chip giant ramped up its venture capital activity in 2024, participating in 49 funding rounds for AI companies, a sharp increase from 34 in 2023, according to PitchBook data. It’s a dramatic surge in investment compared to the previous four years combined, during which Nvidia funded only 38 AI deals. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly ramped up its investing in the last two years. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 24 deals in 2024, compared to just 2 in 2022.) In 2025, Nvidia has already participated in seven rounds. Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million where Nvidia is a named participant since 2023, including new ones it has backed so far in 2025, organized from the highest amount to lowest raised in the round. OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October, reportedly writing a $100 million check toward a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which according to the New York Times invested $1.3 billion. xAI: Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI. The deal revealed that not all of OpenAI’s investors followed its request to refrain from backing any of its direct competitors. After investing in the ChatGPT maker in October, Nvidia joined xAI’s cap table a few months later. Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the most unusual outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company founded by Mustafa Suleyman, who earlier founded DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection AI’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. Wayve: In May, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. The company is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. Crusoe: A startup building data centers reportedly to be leased to Oracle, Microsoft, and OpenAI raised $686 million in late November, according to an SEC filing. The investment was led by Founders Fund, and the long list of other investors included Nvidia. Figure AI: In February 2024, AI robotics startup Figure raised a $675 million Series B from Nvidia, OpenAI Startup Fund, Microsoft, and others. The round valued the company at $2.6 billion. Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the second time when the French-based large language model developer raised a $640 million Series B at a $6 billion valuation in June. Lambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda’s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia’s GPUs. Cohere: In June, Nvidia invested in Cohere’s $500 million round, a large language model provider serving enterprises. The chipmaker first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023. Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November of 2023 and has participated in every subsequent round of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round in December, which values the company at $9 billion, according to PitchBook data. Poolside: In October, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion. CoreWeave: Nvidia invested in the AI cloud computing provider in April 2023, when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Since then, CoreWeave’s valuation has jumped from about $2 billion to $19 billion, and the company has filed for an IPO. CoreWeave allows its customers to rent Nvidia GPUs on an hourly basis. Together AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023. Sakana AI: In September, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt. Waabi: In June, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Ayar Labs: In December, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup. Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity. Sandbox AQ: In April, Nvidia, alongside Google, BNP Paribas, and others, invested $150 million in Sandbox AQ, a startup developing large quantitative models (LQMs) for handling complex numerical analysis and statistical calculations. The investment increased Sandbox AQ’s Series E round to $450 million and the company’s valuation to $5.75 billion. Hippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation. Weka: In May, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion. Runway: In June of 2023, Runway, a startup building generative AI tools for multimedia content creators, raised a $141 million Series C extension from investors, including Nvidia, Google, and Salesforce. Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup. Enfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. Although the startup raised another $115 million in November, Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Editor’s note: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Nvidia is a backer of Safe Superintelligence and an investor in Vast Data’s Series E round.

Title: Why Hollywood studios are still downsizing
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/06/18/hollywood-studios-downsizing/
Time Published: 2025-06-18T17:29:32Z

By Samantha Masunaga, Los Angeles Times Hollywood’s workforce just needed to “survive ’til ’25.” That was last year’s hopeful mantra for entertainment industry pros battered by layoffs and limited film and TV production. But now as the year approaches its halfway point, a bleaker saying seems apt: “Exist ’til ’26.” Rosy projections of a robust recovery this year have not materialized. If anything, the downturn, at least in terms of employment at the studios, has continued. In recent weeks, three media and entertainment giants — Walt Disney Co., Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Global — have said they will lay off staffers. Disney cut several hundred employees in the U.S. and abroad, while Paramount shed hundreds of its domestic workforce and Warner Bros. eliminated several dozen positions. It is yet another sign that the industry is still recovering from the effects of the pandemic and the dual writers’ and actors’ strikes of 2023, while also trying to navigate the changing media landscape. As people continue to cut the cord and viewership of traditional broadcast television declines — taking with it valuable ad dollars — companies are reallocating resources to their streaming platforms. They’re cutting back on spending after massive investments during the so-called streaming wars. And now, economic uncertainty from President Trump’s tariffs has rattled the markets, creating a difficult overall business environment. “We’re going through this squeezing of our ecosystem in Hollywood,” said J. Christopher Hamilton, a practicing entertainment attorney and a professor at Syracuse University who focuses on the business of media. Companies are “trying to find a new normal, adjust to the financial pressures that the global economy is under and also figure out what is the smartest business model and path forward.” It’s a far cry from the hints of optimism some in the industry had toward the end of last year. With the strikes finally in the rearview mirror, and delayed films debuting in theaters and production slowly coming back, the thought was “we’re out of the strikes, we’ll be able to go back to the market, sell and buy,” Hamilton said. Instead, many of the recent conversations he’s had with clients and media executives have been centered on fear and uncertainty. People will tell him that it’s hard to sell a TV show, or that they don’t know if their job will be around in two weeks. The international market has also become more favorable to local content, meaning U.S.-made shows are now heavily competing with homegrown series. “It’s a horrible time in the business from the content creation, content production standpoint,” Hamilton said. “People don’t want to take risks. They’re fearful of losing their jobs.” The idea of “survive ’til ’25” was always a myth, said Stephen Galloway, dean of Chapman University’s Dodge College of Film and Media Arts. The issues the industry is facing are long term and disruptive. “The industry is retrenching,” he said. “And there’s going to be a shake-up that lasts for quite a while.” The continued decline of linear TV is one issue nearly all studios are grappling with. Though viewership is down and can drag on a company’s stock price, traditional broadcast TV still makes money, making it important to manage costs and generate profit for as long as possible. That also means job cuts in those areas. Disney’s layoffs hit its film and television marketing teams, television publicity, casting and development as well as corporate financial operations. Warner Bros. cut employees from its cable TV channels. While Paramount did not disclose the departments affected by the layoffs, its co-chief executives acknowledged in a note to staff that the decision came as the company navigates “continued industry-wide linear declines.” Linear TV’s struggles have led media companies to spin off their traditional television assets, including cable networks, into separate entities. Santa Monica-based Lionsgate got the ball rolling in 2023 when it said it would sever its film and TV studio business from its pay cable unit Starz, a transaction that was completed this year. Late last year, Comcast Corp. said it would make a new company consisting of its cable channels, including CNBC, MSNBC and USA Network. Then on Monday, Warner Bros. said it too would split into two publicly traded companies — one entity called Streaming & Studios and a second called Global Networks, that would consist of its cable channels such as CNN, TNT and Discovery. The Warner Bros. split is “an acknowledgment that the idea of building something big enough to compete in the streaming war didn’t work,” said Peter Murrieta, a writer and deputy director of the Sidney Poitier New American Film School at Arizona State University. Moreover, Netflix’s dominance in the streaming space has made many companies reevaluate their plans. “There were already signs pointing to the unsustainability of the number of shows and the number of streamers,” he said. “It’s the aftereffects of trying to compete at the streaming level and thinking that’s the future. Resources were put there, and now they have to retrench.” Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger has said as much in comments to Wall Street, acknowledging that the House of Mouse pumped out too many shows and movies to compete against Netflix. The company has since pulled back amid Iger’s call to focus on quality over quantity and to reach profitability in its streaming services, which it achieved last year. The company’s latest job postings now include a number of openings for software engineers. The larger economic environment, too, is of concern to those in Hollywood. In addition to industry-specific concerns about artificial intelligence and the decline of traditional TV and cable, the entertainment business is also grappling with domestic and global financial uncertainty. Paramount’s executives cited the “dynamic macro-economic environment” in its note to employees. “Right now, there is an absolute sense of terror among people in the business that they’ll be out of a job, that the old models aren’t working, that they won’t earn what they once did,” said Galloway of Chapman. “They’re not wrong to be afraid. I think they’re wrong to be as afraid as they are because it’s a retrenchment, and it’s a retrenchment following a gigantic expansion.” White-collar jobs in other industries are also being threatened by technological change, greater investment in AI and retrenchments after pandemic-era hiring sprees. Earlier this year, tech companies such as payment firm Square, Meta, Google and Workday said they would lay off employees. But Hollywood has always been a boom-and-bust industry, Galloway said, noting that in times of change, new opportunities always arise. Jobs in virtual production or AI are becoming more numerous. As studios cut back on their staff, they will still need producers to shepherd shows and films, said Susan Sprung, chief executive of the Producers Guild of America trade group. “These companies aren’t getting out of the business of producing great programming, movies and television,” she said. “If you don’t have as large of an executive team that can help supplement that, it makes it even more important that you have good producers working on every one of your projects.” While the current environment is tough, the industry has always been difficult, and people in this business are resourceful and intentional about their work, said Murrieta of Arizona State. Though it is a trying time, he said, “there’s got to be hope.” ©2025 Los Angeles Times. Visit at latimes.com. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

Behemoth’s release to June” before “delay[ing] . . . to fall or later.” On this news, Meta’s stock price fell $19.02 per share, or 2.88%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $640.34 per share on May 16, 2025.

The release of DeepSeek V3 and R1 in January 2025 caused steep declines in the stock prices of companies that provide generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) infrastructure technology and datacenter services.28 These two large language models (LLMs) came from a little-known Chinese startup with approximately 200 employees versus at least 3,500 for industry-leader OpenAI.2,14 DeepSeek seemed to have developed this powerful technology much more cheaply than previously thought possible. If true, DeepSeek had the potential to disrupt the economics of the entire GenAI ecosystem and the dominance of U.S. companies ranging from OpenAI to Nvidia.5,6 DeepSeek-R1 defines itself as “an artificial intelligence language model developed by OpenAI, specifically based on the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) architecture.”a Here, DeepSeek acknowledges that the transformer researchers (who published their landmark paper while at Google in 2017) and OpenAI developed its basic technology. Nonetheless, V3 and R1 display impressive skills in neural-network system design, engineering, and optimization, and DeepSeek’s publications provide rare insights into how the technology actually works. This column reviews, for the non-expert reader, what we know about DeepSeek’s origins, technology, and impact so far. The parent of DeepSeek is High-Flyer, a quant hedge fund founded in 2015 in the city of Hangzhou, China.b It relies on AI and machine learning (ML) for stock-trading decisions. The cofounder, Liang Wenfeng (born 1985), is a graduate of Zhejiang University. He studied machine vision and started the company with two classmates after researching the topic since 2008. High-Flyer is reported to have 113 employees and $59 million in revenues while managing $8 billion in assets.11,c During 2019–2022, High-Flyer spent approximately $139 million and stockpiled 10,000 Nvidia A100 GPUs to build a supercomputer. The A100 is lower in performance than the datacenter-standard Nvidia H100 (the U.S. government banned both for export to China in October 2023).9,24,29 In 2021, the Chinese government began a regulatory crackdown on high-frequency speculative stock trading. In response, Liang created a second team of researchers to focus on fundamental AI and ML research. He hired graduates from top Chinese universities and worked closely with Chinese academics. The team evaded government scrutiny because it was separate from the investment group and not focused on consumer AI.9,25 In 2023, High-Flyer spun off this second team as DeepSeek (see the accompanying table). One year later, the new company released products and reports that attracted worldwide attention. (In March 2025, the Chinese government also named DeepSeek a “national treasure” and placed travel restrictions on key employees.26) What made headlines was DeepSeek’s claim, based on a technical report published on its website dated December 27, 2024, that the company spent merely $5.6 million training V3. DeepSeek also claimed V3 approximated or exceeded the performance of other leading LLMs (Qwen 2.5–Alibaba, Llama 3.1–Meta, GPT-4o–OpenAI, Claude 3.5–Anthropic). The cost was so low because V3 required only 2.788 million hours of pre-training and post-training, done on a cluster of 2,000 Nvidia H800 GPUs (the lower-bandwidth version of H100, permissible for export to China), at an estimated cost of $2/hour. By contrast, to train GPT-4, it is reported that OpenAI used a cluster of 16,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs and spent at least $100 million.12,29 It had generally been accepted that companies need to spend $100 million to $1 billion to train their LLMs.11 The higher number covers variations, such as the nine different versions of Meta’s Lama 3.d It probably did not cost much to develop R1 once DeepSeek had V3.1 However, DeepSeek has not revealed the separate development costs for R1 or its predecessors and variants. We also do not know how much hardware High-Flyer and DeepSeek had access to in addition to the supercomputer. The research firm SemiAnalysis estimates DeepSeek had access to as many as 50,000 Hopper-class (probably H800) Nvidia GPUs and, for V3/R1, spent more than $500 million on GPU hardware and about $1.3 billion in total development costs.9 These estimates, which seem to be approximate guesses made in hindsight, would be comparable to development costs for the reasoning GPT models from OpenAI and the Llama 3 series from Meta. The December 2024 technical report also states that, “During pre-training, we train [sic] DeepSeek-V3 on 14.8T high-quality and diverse tokens.”8 One token equals approximately four characters or 0.75 English words. Fifteen billion tokens are approximately the amount of high-quality text available on the English-language Internet. It is also the estimate for pre-training tokens Meta used for Llama 3 and twice the estimate for OpenAI’s GPT-4 of 6.5 trillion tokens.10 In other words, training on DeepSeek-V3 reportedly took many fewer hours and much less money than comparable LLMs but covered a similar or much higher level of content. Sasha Rush concludes as well that V3’s performance is comparable to OpenAI GPT-4o but with substantially less training costs, while R1 resembles an open source version of OpenAI-o1, which had been the market leader for reasoning LLMs.22 Reasoning LLMs generate better answers if they run more computations in the inference (question-answering) stage. The reasoning approach works particularly well when there are correct answers the system can check against and provide rewards for, like in mathematical modeling, coding, or logical reasoning.22 DeepSeek built R1 as a reasoning version of V3 and released two smaller versions of R1 based on distillations of the open source Llama 3 (Meta) and Qwen 2.5 (Alibaba).7,21,e V3 consumed the bulk of the engineering work but R1 is important because it showed DeepSeek that “reasoning emerges as a behavior from pure reinforcement learning.”19 Here we see a difference in training strategy. OpenAI built its reasoning models by starting with human-supervised fine-tuning and then using reinforcement learning, followed again by extensive human fine-tuning. By contrast, DeepSeek skipped human pre-training and allowed the model to improve its reasoning capabilities by learning on its own (that is, reinforcement learning with rewards) and then a few hours of human post-training. As it built R1, DeepSeek also enhanced V3 through rounds of reinforcement learning, with rewards and verifications of answers. V3 and R1 used the same training data, and the V3-base model is inside R1. However, R1 benefitted from this “distillation” of learning from V3. Moreover, designing R1 to show the reasoning process made it easier to fine-tune.22 Part of the explanation for the low-cost, high-performance of V3/R1 is DeepSeek’s follower position and access to open source technology.20 But equally important seems to be DeepSeek’s technology and training strategy. Most experts cite the clever architecture and multistage training, with human fine-tuning only in a post-training phase. In particular, three complementary approaches and supporting techniques balanced engineering cost and system performance: Mixture of experts, reinforcement learning, and distillation. Mixture of experts (MoE) and supporting techniques. MoE architectures use several small specialized language models to spread out the data analysis and training load. Different prompts or “weights” call up specialized experts that, of the total parameters available, access only a small subset, such as 37 billion out of 671 billion parameters in R1. Accessing a subset of parameters, called Sparse Neural Network Training, avoids redundant or unnecessary calculations. By contrast, GPT-4 appears as a “dense” neural network with access to 1.8 trillion parameters for every operation.16 The MoE concept is not new but has been difficult to scale.22 The French startup Mistral AI did release in December 2023 the “open-weight” MoE LLM 8x7B, with eight experts (two operational at any given time), each accessing a total of 166 billion parameters and resembling a “scaled-down GPT-4.” Apparently, it was innovative and efficient but did not garner the same attention as the efficient and low-cost DeepSeek V3/R1.13 DeepSeek relied on specific techniques to minimize compute resources needed to share data across the smaller experts. It used parallelization to coordinate the computational tasks running on different clusters of networked computers (GPUs). It used quantization to improve computational efficiency by limiting the precision of calculations (decimal points) to the lowest level necessary for a specific computation.22 Examples would be converting 32-bit floating-point numbers to 16-bit, 8-bit, or even integer (whole-number) formats. Reinforcement learning (RL) and supporting techniques. The RL approach focuses on ML via trial and error with rewards for particular outcomes, in R1’s case, accuracy and format of the answers. OpenAI and other reasoning LLMs also use reinforcement learning and rewards.18 However, OpenAI has relied heavily on supervised training by human experts that requires enormous amounts of data and time for pre-labeling the data sets and feeding the system questions and correct answers.16 DeepSeek says it used human supervision only in post-training to fine-tune its models and spent very few hours.8 In general, the analogy would be to train a computer to play chess by giving it the rules on how to move pieces and then letting the machine learn mostly by playing matches rather than pretraining with insights from a human grandmaster.11 Other techniques complemented RL. Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning divides a large, complex problem into intermediate steps that are easier to analyze and refine.17 DeepSeek used RL and CoT training to turn V3 from a relatively simple LLM into the more sophisticated reasoning R1 by asking it to show the steps used to analyze and answer questions.21 Another complementary technique is group relative policy optimization (GRPO). Many LLMs incorporate a slow and expensive training approach with a “policy model” (rules or guidelines) to decide on actions and then a separate “critic model” to evaluate those actions. GRPO skips the critic model step by taking groups of scores (data from several actions) and learning by comparing the scores.29 In the R1 white paper, DeepSeek reported: “we use DeepSeek-V3-Bases as the base model and employ GRPO as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning … We directly apply RL to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems.”7 DeepSeek also used multi-token prediction (MTP) during V3 pretraining to improve data efficiency, noting: “Instead of predicting just the next single token, DeepSeek-V3 predicts the next two tokens through the MTP technique … which we have observed to enhance the overall performance on evaluation benchmarks.”8 Distillation. This approach uses a large “teacher” model to transfer knowledge to train or fine-tune a smaller “student” model. The smaller model requires much less memory and compute time to operate, and can be faster during the inference stage. For example, the teacher model can transfer prediction outputs that serve as instructions for how to answer specific types of questions, saving the student model from the extensive training and computations normally required to arrive at those instructions.17 There have been suggestions that DeepSeek distilled outputs or acquired proprietary data from OpenAI models, but there is no evidence of this.22,23 DeepSeek used a distillation of R1 for post-training of V3 to add some reasoning capability and it used V3 to help train R1.8 DeepSeek also experimented with small versions of R1 trained on distillations of the open source Qwen 2.5 and Llama 3. These distilled versions performed better than a preliminary model (DeepSeek-R1-Zero), despite being much smaller, though they did not perform as well as R1.19 The DeepSeek team offered two conclusions regarding this combination of distillation and reinforcement learning as well as the limitations of their approach: “First, distilling more powerful models into smaller ones yields excellent results, whereas smaller models relying on the large-scale RL … require enormous computational power and may not even achieve the performance of distillation. Second, while distillation strategies are both economical and effective, advancing beyond the boundaries of intelligence may still require more powerful base models and larger-scale reinforcement learning.”7 DeepSeek optimized V3 and R1 for different tasks. V3 does very well on standard benchmarking tests for logic problems and code writing. R1 is better at deeper reasoning and math.12,16 Both V3 and R1 are said to be comparable or better than LLMs from Anthropic (Claude) and xAI (Grok), though still behind Google (Gemini).11 Chatbot Arena at University of California Berkeley publishes a ranking where R1 came in third, matching the performance of ChatGPT-4o.3 The cost to access V3 and R1 application programming interfaces (APIs) is so low that DeepSeek has disrupted the economics of the LLM API market.4 In early 2025, DeepSeek priced V3 at $0.07 per million input tokens and $0.11 per million output tokens, and R1 at $0.55 for input and $2.19 per million output tokens. By contrast, OpenAI priced GPT-4o at $15 per million input and $60 per million output tokens (prices that were approximately half of what OpenAI had charged earlier).29 Price-performance has made DeepSeek very popular among open source developers and all major cloud service providers support access. In China, car manufacturers, local governments, hospitals, state-owned enterprises, and private companies have embedded DeepSeek into their applications. Tencent has incorporated DeepSeek into its search engine for WeChat and the Chinese version Weixin. Baidu uses DeepSeek in its search engine. Other major companies such as Huawei, NetEase, Bytedance/TikTok are also users.15 In the U.S., AMD has integrated DeepSeek-V3 into its Instinct MI300X GPUs to optimize AI inference and GPU performance.28 However, some countries (the U.S., Australia, South Korea, India, Italy, and Taiwan) have warned about Chinese ownership or prohibited usage on government devices.27 There has been concern that DeepSeek’s low prices could commoditize GenAI technology and lead to steep drops in company sales. But another potential outcome is Jevons Paradox—the observation that improvements in efficiency and lower prices do not necessarily lead to falling revenues.3 If demand is sensitive to price, then usage and sales could increase dramatically as more people access the less expensive product or service. So far, Jevons Paradox seems to be holding up: Demand for GenAI software and GPU hardware continues to rise. Reasoning LLMs are improving and likely to find many more applications. Debates continue around the significance of DeepSeek’s innovations. Dario Amodei, cofounder of Anthropic and former VP of Research at OpenAI, describes DeepSeek’s achievement as mainly an important advance in engineering efficiency. He sees V3/R1 as part of a shift already underway from a focus during 2020–2023 on expensive and time-consuming pretraining, running software on ever-more-powerful and expensive hardware, to more economical machine-based reinforcement learning, sometimes with less than state-of-the-art hardware.1 However we view DeepSeek, it seems noteworthy that a Chinese startup, operating under American export constraints, has demonstrated clever ways to balance cost and performance in LLM development. DeepSeek’s open source code and sharing of detailed information has already made GenAI technology more accessible and understandable.

Neonatal sepsis (NNS) continues to be a leading cause of neonatal mortality in low-resource settings. NNS can occur secondary to umbilical stump infections (omphalitis) and this requires preventative cord care practices. To address this, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued context-specific recommendations for the use of 7.1% chlorhexidine (CHX) solution in areas with high neonatal mortality. Despite adoption of this policy, monitoring and evaluation of this guidance is lacking. This study describes the experiences of healthcare workers (HCWs) regarding cord care practices in Kiambu County, Kenya. We employed an exploratory qualitative design. Key informant interviews were conducted with 38 HCWs between October 6th and November 9th 2022 in six healthcare facilities in Kiambu County. Data were analyzed thematically using NVivo software. While Ministry of Health guidelines endorse WHO’s recommendation for the nation-wide use of CHX for neonatal cord care, its implementation in Kiambu county remains varied. HCWs continue to favour surgical spirit, and one of the healthcare facilities in our study adopted a facility-based policy of dry cord care. HCWs also relayed that mothers often combined modern and traditional methods. Some HCWs reported high satisfaction with CHX due to its perceived effectiveness, ease of use, and faster stump healing. However, systemic and product-specific barriers to uptake were noted. Systemic issues included frequent CHX stock-outs and high out-of-pocket costs due to inconsistent county-level supply and lack of insurance coverage. Product-specific concerns such as difficulty of application and reported adverse effects (e.g., delayed cord detachment, sepsis, burns) further impeded use. Knowledge gaps and contrary instructions among and between both the HCWs and mothers also undermined CHX use. Despite CHX being the recommended intervention for cord care in Kenya, its inconsistent use in Kiambu county reflects gaps in policy enforcement, supply chain reliability, and health education. The persistence of outdated or non-recommended cord care practices underscores a critical lack of oversight. To realize CHX’s full public health potential, urgent policy action is needed to ensure consistent availability, enforcement of national neonatal guidelines, and investment into inclusive IEC materials. Bridging the gap between policy and practice is essential for reducing neonatal morbidity and achieving equitable progress towards Kenya’s goal of Universal Health Coverage.

Neonatal sepsis (NNS) is a significant cause of neonatal mortality during the first month of life [1]. One of the primary contributors to NNS is the development of omphalitis, which is the infection of the umbilical stump [2]. This infection often arises as a result of improper and/or inadequate umbilical cord care practices, which can ultimately lead to neonatal mortality in up to 15% of cases [1]. While this is relatively uncommon in developed nations, it is a significant contributor to neonatal mortality in developing nations [1], such as Kenya. Due to this burden of NNS secondary to omphalitis, the World Health Organization (WHO) has provided context-specific recommendations for newborns in settings where: (1) harmful traditional substances are prevalent and (2) the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) exceeds 30 in 1000 live births [3]. This recommendation is based on a meta-analysis of individual patient data, involving 177 neonates from five trials with a total of 129,391 newborns [3]. CHX for cord care has been shown to reduce NMR by up to 23% and prevents infection by 38–68% [4]. Furthermore, observational studies from low-income countries suggest that replacing harmful traditional cord care practices with antiseptics could save many newborn lives use [5,6]. However, this recommendation remains tentative due to the lack of data on sepsis and an inadequately described search strategy in the systemic review cited [5,6]. Moreover, the exclusion of observational studies from low-income settings (due to the absence of randomized controlled trials) limits its relevance for LMICs. The recommendation of dry cord care for LMICs that otherwise meet the criteria is therefore questionable, especially since the Cochrane review itself found no significant difference in infection rates between placebo and antiseptic use [5,7]. Kenya has a 29.3% prevalence of NNS [8], and the incidence rate of omphalitis is estimated at between 20–77 of every 1000 live births of newborns delivered within healthcare facilities [9]. The incidence rate of omphalitis is purported to be higher in at-home births [9]. The NMR has been documented 21 deaths per 1,000 live births, accounting for 66% of infant deaths and 51% of under-5 deaths [10]. However, this NMR varies widely between the counties of Kenya. A 2018 study conducted in Machakos County revealed that, of all the admissions in the newborn unit, 34% constituted cases of NNS and were associated with 15% of the deaths reported [9]. WHO’s recommendation for the contextual use of CHX for cord care is a transition from the previous recommendation of the use of surgical spirit [11], a recommendation which was also reflected in Kenya’s 2009 National Guidelines for Quality Perinatal Care [12]. Surgical spirit is no longer recommended for umbilical cord care due to its limited efficacy in preventing infections, potential to irritate newborn skin, and the availability of safer, more effective alternatives like CHX [11,13–15]. In 2016, however, the Government of Kenya recommended the use of CHX in all births to ensure equal standards in healthcare provision for all citizens of the country [16], therefore adopting the new WHO guidelines nation-wide [17]. Since Kenya’s adoption of the WHO recommendation on the use of CHX in all neonates in 2016, the implementation has been set to take three phases: (1) preparation, (2) planning, and (3) execution. Expounded, this process includes the alignment of policy, developing guidelines, introducing the product, training of service providers, generating demand for the product, and finally, monitoring and evaluation (M&E). A 2016 study by Muriuki et al. found that HCWs in rural Kenya widely accepted the use of CHX for umbilical cord care, citing benefits such as faster healing, reduced infections, ease of use, and positive community feedback [18]. For successful scale-up, they emphasized the need for community sensitization, proper training, consistent supply, clear guidelines, and inclusive service delivery approaches [18]. However, a 2021 cross-sectional study at Kangundo Level 4 Hospital found that while most mothers received some education on CHX use, both mothers and HCWs demonstrated poor understanding of its proper application [9]. Different counties are expected to have achieved different levels of adoption given that healthcare in Kenya is devolved to the county level with the national level providing policy guidance. Given that Kenya has a goal to further increase the uptake of CHX treatment to above 80% in all health care facilities by 2026 [4], the adoption of CHX for cord care has yet to undergo M&E through the perspectives of HCWs. The CHX uptake in Kiambu county is 40.1% [18], and therefore, understanding HCW experiences with cord care practices in the county would be essential to shape health policy and highlighting gaps in its implementation. The study adopted an exploratory qualitative design using key informant interviews (KIIs) guided by semi-structured question guides, and which were conducted between 6th October 2022–9th November 2022. The data was collected from six health facilities in Kiambu County. This study was carried out in Kiambu County, Kenya, which has a population of over 2.4 million people. The location coordinates are 10 10’S 36050’E, and it neighbors six other counties, namely Nairobi City and Kajiado Counties to the South, Machakos to the East, Murang’a to the North East, Nyandarua to the North west, and Nakuru County to the West [19]. The county is 60% urban and 40% rural due to its proximity to the capital city Nairobi. The county has 505 health facilities, comprising 108 public, 64 faith-based, and 333 privately owned facilities. In Kenya’s health system, Level 1 refers to community-based services (e.g., health promotion and preventive care), Level 2 to dispensaries, Level 3 to health centers, Level 4 to sub-county hospitals, and Level 5 to county referral hospitals. Maternity services are typically offered at Level 3 (health centers) and above, including private and faith-based hospitals. Therefore, this study gathered insights from HCWs working in Level 3, 4, and 5 public facilities, as well as private hospitals. One of the Level 5 hospitals (Thika Level 5 Hospital) in this study also functions as a teaching hospital for medical and nursing students. CHX for newborn umbilical cord care is available in two formulations: gel and solution [20]. Both forms are recommended by the WHO and are included in the Kenya Essential Medicines List as well as in postnatal care guidelines [20–22]. In line with this, Kenya’s Ministry of Health (MoH) endorses the availability and use of both CHX formulations [20]. The choice between the dosage formulations used depends on what is acceptable to mothers, caregivers, HCWs and availability [23]. According to the national guidelines, immediately post-delivery, a HCW should apply CHX to the newborn’s umbilical cord using sterile gloves. The antiseptic is applied to the base, stump, and tip of the cord [20]. For gel formulations, the HCW uses their index finger to spread it; for the solution, the dropper is used to apply CHX directly. The CHX is not cleaned off after application. In the postnatal period, CHX should be applied once daily until the seventh day or until the cord naturally detaches: whichever happens first. Mothers and/or caregivers are instructed on how to apply CHX at home following the same procedures, but in lieu of sterile gloves, they are advised to thoroughly wash their hands before each application. The National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), now defunct, but which was active during the period of the study, had a program called Linda Mama that covered the costs of antenatal care (ANC), delivery, and postnatal care (PNC) for all pregnant women [24]. However, it notably excluded the cost of CHX, and currently, there is no government-sponsored program providing CHX free of charge to mothers during the postnatal period. The study population consisted of over 2,600 HCWs providing health services in Kiambu County during the study period. No formal sample size was calculated and we applied the information saturation principle [25]. Two providers were targeted in every unit (with a target of 30 HCWs) during the study’s formulation, however some units were understaffed during the study and hence only had one HCW interviewed. The cadre and respective facility of the sample are presented in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326506.t001 Inclusion criteria - HCWs who had direct interactions with neonates or were involved in providing or handling CHX cord antiseptic during the study period, and who had at least 6 months of experience with cord care. Exclusion criteria - HCWs who were not directly involved in newborn care or who declined to provide informed consent and who had less than 6 months of experience with cord care. A total of 38 KIIs were conducted between 6th October 2022 and 9th November 2022. All interviews were conducted by two members of the study team, JMG and BNO, both holding Bachelor of Pharmacy (BPharm) degrees. JMG serves as the Kiambu county pharmacist and holds a PhD in pharmacy, while BNO is a researcher with experience in qualitative data analysis. Both researchers received training prior to data collection to ensure consistency and quality. The interviews were conducted in English, but participants were allowed to respond in either English or Kiswahili. BNO, who is bilingual and fluent in both written and spoken English and Standard Kiswahili, translated the KIIs, which were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim directly from Kiswahili into English when applicable. Each participant was assigned a unique index number (1–38), and quotations are referenced using the format: HospitalName_Cadre_IndexNumber. Kobo Toolbox software was used to collect and manage data, with all data coded to conceal the participants’ identities. To ensure data security, electronic data collected via KoboCollect were encrypted and password-protected on the devices. After transfer, data files were securely stored on password-protected computers and backed up on a secure cloud platform with restricted access. NVivo project files were similarly protected to maintain confidentiality and data integrity throughout the analysis process. Interview transcripts were imported into NVivo software to assist in the classification, sorting, and coding of data into central themes and subthemes. The coding process followed a two-cycle approach. In the first cycle, value coding was used to capture participants’ attitudes and values, reflecting their perceptions and experiences. The second cycle involved focused and pattern coding. Focused coding developed specific categories without focusing on their properties, while pattern coding grouped similar codes into meaningful units for theme identification [26–28]. NVivo’s platform played a crucial role in facilitating this multi-level coding process, ensuring consistency in the analysis framework by identifying recurring patterns and connections. The research questions and interview guide informed the coding frame, allowing for accurate classification of notable data segments to reveal dominant themes. The integration of value, focused, and pattern coding in both cycles ensured a comprehensive and structured analysis of the interview data [26–28].BNO, JMG, and PKJ also independently reviewed the transcripts to familiarize themselves with the data and identify initial codes. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion to ensure consistency and reliability. Upon arrival at the various study sites, verbal consent was initially sought from the manager of each facility unit, followed by written consent from the hospital medical superintendent. Prior to the initiation of data collection, participants were informed about the study’s objectives and their role as respondents. They were assured that participation was entirely voluntary and that they had the right to withdraw at any time. All data collected by the researchers were treated as confidential and utilized exclusively for this study. Access to the materials was restricted to the investigators, and stringent data management protocols were implemented to uphold the confidentiality of the study subjects. Approval was obtained at various administrative levels, including county and sub-county authorities before the study commenced. Ethical clearance was secured from the University of Nairobi/Kenyatta National Hospital Ethical Review Committee [P470/05/2022], County Government of Kiambu Department of Health Services, Kiambu County [KIAMBU/HRDU/22/09/14/RA_GITHINJI], and a research license was obtained from the National Commission for Science, Technology and Innovation [NACOSTI/P/22/20446]. A total of 38 HCWs were interviewed, as depicted in Table 1. The mean age of respondents was 35.6 years (Range: 23–57 years). The HCWs interviewed had a mean of 9.4 years of professional experience, with a median of 7.5 years, a mode of 7 years, and a range spanning from 0.5 to 30 years. In terms of time spent at their current stations, the average was 4.4 years, with a median of 3 years, a mode of 1 year, and a range from the minimum of 0.5 years to 22 years. Participants had an average practice duration of 9 years. The transcripts drawn from recordings of KIIs held with selected HCWs were analyzed, and themes emerged as 33 files with 52 references. Some themes mirrored the guiding questions in the semi-structured questionnaire, as shown in the coding tree as Fig 1.

National policy recommendation We sought to understand the general cord care practices in various health facilities across Kiambu County by interviewing HCWs. According to MoH guidelines, the use of CHX for cord care has been officially recommended, with the directive being disseminated from the central government to the county level. This was confirmed by a participant from Nazareth Hospital, who stated, “first of all, we have the policy that is an order that came from Kiambu County from the Ministry of Health that chlorhexidine should be used” (Nazareth_Pharmacist_25). The majority of participants acknowledged the existence of the MoH guidelines recommending CHX for cord care, confirmed that this policy had been communicated to health facilities and gave a description of the same policy in their responses. “So after birth, when you cut the cord, immediately we use the chlorhexidine, and after, we use it once a day, once a day after delivery until now the mothers goes home and you instruct them to use it until the cord dries off and falls off.” (Nazareth_Midwife_27) “…the next thing is to maintain hygiene of the cord, and this is done by applying an antiseptic. Commonly we use chlorhexidine, either the gel or the solution.” (Kiambu_ Paediatrician_36) “...The guys from the [MoH] when they come, they say, “No, you must use [CHX]. You must use [CHX]...” (Thika_Midwife_13) 2. Facility-level departures from national recommendations HCWs mentioned that surgical spirit remained the predominant choice in practice, indicating a reluctance to fully transition from previous guidelines. In fact, almost half (41.7%) of participants reported having prior experience with surgical spirit before being required to switch to CHX, which was a new product in their facilities. Some facilities reported not using CHX at all, relying solely on surgical spirit for cord care. This variation in practice highlights the need for further investigation into the slow adoption of CHX in these settings, despite the existence of formal guidelines. Furthermore, despite clear directives, Thika Level 5 Hospital actively deviated from the National Guidelines, opting instead to follow its own facility-based protocol of dry cord care. “Here in our health facility... We discussed with our pediatrician and we just decided to leave the cord just like that. Don’t put anything, don’t put water, don’t put the spirit, and don’t put chlorhexidine, as long as you keep it clean. And we have not had any case of sepsis... The guys from the [MoH] when they come, they say, “No, you must use [CHX]. You must use [CHX].” But then we are agreed for us, we don’t use it here, we have not been using it, and we have not had any cases of neonatal sepsis.” (Thika_Midwife_13) “So the current cord care practice in Thika Level 5 I would say, predominantly because that’s where I practice is dry cord care. I hardly do surgical spirit or chlorhexidine or any other medication directly with the cord.” (Thika_ Paediatrician_12) “And what I’ve noted, there is less uptake of chlorhexidine use for cord care compared to the surgical spirit.... the pediatrician and also other practitioners [are] persistent on the use of surgical spirit as opposed to chlorhexidine.” (Nazareth_ANC-nurse_23) “So currently, in Kiambu County, there are different things that are being done … some places and institutions that are using chlorhexidine for cord care. Then a number of institutions are using surgical spirit. There are some people who even believe on doing nothing to cord care. There are people who are using normal saline for cord care.” (Thika_ Paediatrician_37) “…I just know most of the time, they don’t even use that chlorhexidine. They use surgical spirit.” (Kihara_Pharmacist_18) 3. Mothers’ use of blended and traditional cord care methods A minor theme emerged in which some HCWs reported that mothers used multiple cord care methods, often influenced by either their past experiences or family advice, or both. For example, if surgical spirit had been ineffective with their first baby, they would switch to CHX for subsequent children, and vice versa. In some cases, mothers who delivered during the era of previous guidelines recommending surgical spirit continued to favour it. Other practices included the use of saliva, a traditional method still common in our context. “There is the use of … saliva, especially for the traditional mothers” (Ruiru_PNC-nurse_5) “One challenge is that mothers out there, they have other methods of doing cord care. When you teach them how to do it, they go at home and they’re taught by other relatives how to do it … Like they will buy spirit because the other baby they used spirit, or they will use another thing like savlon that’s hindering proper use of the chlorhexidine.” (Nazareth_ANC-nurse_23) “some mothers are resistant to change, especially those who delivered much earlier and chlorhexidine was not there before. So if they used spirit, they still want to use spirit … or even using saliva or cow dung.” (Nazareth_Midwife_27) “The common challenge that we face is that mothers believe in the use of some traditional methods like use of saliva.” (Ruiru_Midwife_6) The preferences that HCWs had for CHX in cord care were varied, largely shaped by their clinical and anecdotal experiences with different methods. Approximately half of the HCWs who expressed satisfaction with CHX did so primarily due to its perceived effectiveness in preventing omphalitis and NNS. This ultimately reduced the need for additional healthcare visits for both mothers and newborns. Many HCWs in favor of CHX also highlighted that it promoted quicker stump healing compared to other methods, provided that mothers followed proper instructions, maintained good hygiene, and began cord care immediately or shortly after birth. Additionally, CHX was praised for being easy to use, contributing to its widespread adoption and positive outcomes. “So far, the outcomes have been good. We have had limited cases of sepsis after the use of chlorhexidine.” (Kiambu_Midwife_22) “… those who practice, okay, cord care with chlorhexidine as they are instructed, the outcome is good.” (Kihara_Midwife_16) “The use of chlorhexidine for cord care has made work easier in Kiambu since it’s easy to use and its availability, its efficacy being high has made it easier for us to manage the newborns and their mothers are even happy with the healing process using chlorhexidine gel.” (Kiambu_Pharmacist_34) “The effectiveness of cord care is better compared with [traditional or surgical spirit] methods … in comparison with the mothers that have been using the surgical spirit and the cord care, during the postnatal checkup one week post-delivery, the mothers who have been using the chlorhexidine, the cords are healed faster compared with other methods.” (Ruiru_PNC-nurse_5) 1. Systemic barriers One of the most significant barriers to the adoption and provision of CHX for cord care was its inconsistent availability in government health facilities. This challenge of access was twofold: not only was there a shortage of government-supplied CHX to health facilities, and when it was available, its cost often priced consumers out of the market. Many mothers at the facility found the cost of CHX prohibitive. As a result, HCWs recommended more affordable alternatives, which hindered CHX’s widespread adoption and led mothers to choose cheaper options like surgical spirit. “…And then the erratic supplies for the county, particularly because of those financial constraints the counties have been having have made it easy for us to try out other things because in the absence of chlorhexidine, what else was being done to allow cords to heal... the supplies and the county, it’s quite irregular. The stock-outs are very, very, very common because of the budgetary constraints in the county.” (Thika_ Paediatrician _12) “The first challenge is limited resources from the county. That is, when receiving our delivery from KEMSA, we might also be able to receive chlorhexidine. Another challenge is from the patients. Once the drug is prescribed, some patients may not be able to purchase from the pharmacies outside.” (Kihara_Pharmacist_24) “The challenges of provision of chlorhexidine gel, first of all, I’d say it’s not readily available. As in, even if I sent a mother outside here to buy, I don’t think it’s as available as there rest. Secondly, the cost. It’s a challenge because the mothers are not able to afford it” (Githunguri_ANC-nurse_33) 2. Perceived product-specific disadvantages Some HCWs associated CHX use with delayed cord healing, sepsis, and prolonged cord detachment. In a few instances, they reported that neonates had returned to the hospital with infections after its use. Concerns also emerged over the varying CHX formulations, which caused confusion, particularly due to its resemblance to tetracycline eye ointment and challenges in proper application. The drop formulation was especially scrutinized, with some HCWs believing it contributed to sepsis and soft tissue burns. Their perceptions of CHX's effectiveness were largely shaped by mothers’ feedback. These second-hand accounts reinforced the belief that CHX was less effective than other cord care methods, ultimately influencing its use within health facilities. “…The [CHX] drops, the mothers are coming back with septic cords. I don’t know whether it’s the hygiene at home or what. I don’t get. But when we get a mother that comes and then we take the history, they say they bought the drops. But with the gel, no, not much sepsis. But with the drops, there is.” (Kiambu_Midwife_35) “Now, the problem with the gel was that either it was too thick and it kept leaving the cord moist, and so it would take longer for the cord to drop off … So, a lot of children would come with delayed cord dropping.” (Thika_Paediatrician_12) “Initially, we used to use the chlorhexidine gel, which was a bit difficult to use because it required one to wash their hands or change their gloves, apply the gel on their finger, and then spread the gel on the cord and surrounding skin. The gel could also be confused with tetracycline eye ointment because of the kind of packaging it came in. However, with the solution, it's much easier to use because all one needs to do is to drop a few drops on the umbilical cord and leave the baby's cord to dry. The packaging is also very different from the tetracycline eye ointment, so confusion is reduced.” (Kiambu_Paediatrician_36) 3. Inconsistent use instructions The data corpus revealed a significant knowledge gap among HCWs and mothers regarding the use of CHX for cord care, with some indicating that it should be applied once a day but others recommending it twice a day. HCWs often demonstrated preferences for alternative practices, reflecting a reluctance towards the adoption of CHX. These gaps were primarily due to insufficient HCW training on CHX application, leading to a lack of awareness among mothers about proper usage. “… the mothers need an education. There are mothers who will not want to use chlorhexidine gel because of mythical thoughts or superstition, or that’s not what they were taught by their mothers to use. So, sensitization is needed … we need to sensitize the healthcare workers because sometimes we have found mothers who have not used chlorhexidine gel because the physician who was working with the mother did not believe in the working of chlorhexidine gel.” (Kiambu_Pharmacist_34) 4. Inertia Among HCWs, the knowledge gap regarding CHX use is further complicated by resistance to switch from surgical spirit, which many have successfully used in the past. This resistance is often rooted in personal experiences with both products. HCWs tend to favor surgical spirit, largely due to their familiarity with it and the perceived shortcomings of CHX. “I think the fact that most of the healthcare workers were used to surgical spirit, the switch to chlorhexidine and the fact that it takes time, the cord takes time to heal, I think most people are still reluctant to start mothers on the gel. They’ll prefer surgical spirit.” (Kihara_PNC-nurse_15) HCWs underscored the need for increased awareness and education among both HCWs and patients, citing persistent knowledge gaps regarding CHX’s benefits and proper usage. Many recommended improving accessibility by including CHX in maternity packages or ensuring its consistent availability in hospital pharmacies, thereby enabling timely application immediately after delivery, which is a critical factor for its efficacy. Affordability also emerged as a central concern, with suggestions to reduce the cost of CHX and incorporate it into health insurance schemes such as (formerly) Linda Mama to alleviate the financial burden on mothers. Furthermore, HCWs advocated for comprehensive training programs targeting midwives, doctors, and pediatricians to deepen their understanding of CHX. Such training would enable healthcare providers to more effectively counsel patients, thereby promoting greater uptake of CHX in cord care practices. “Yes. So number one, it’s the cost. It is readily available to them considering that it is covered by NHIF, number one...” (Nazareth_Midwife_27) “Suggest that the hospital should source for more of the drug to ensure that it’s constantly available for use to increase its uptake. Interviewer: If it was available, do you think everybody would use. Interviewee: Yeah.” (Kiambu_Midwife_22) “I think we need proper training for the staff, especially in maternity, even for us working in the postnatal clinics, because I understand the gel should be started immediately after birth.” (Kihara_PNC-nurse_15) “The other one is educating, first of all, the healthcare worker on how to use it so that the healthcare worker is empowered to also educate the mothers on how to use it.” (Thika_Pharmacist_11) IEC materials depicting the application of CHX were found to be largely unavailable and inadequate in healthcare facilities. A significant majority of respondents (86.1%) reported that these materials were inaccessible in most hospital units, resulting in ineffective promotion of CHX utilization. In cases where materials did exist, they were often not suitable for illiterate women, who frequently resorted to traditional methods of cord care. To address this gap, HCWs suggested developing more inclusive IEC materials, such as pictorials and patient-friendly infographics, to ensure that all mothers could benefit from the health education provided. These materials included charts, pictograms, and illustrations that use inclusive language. using accessible language. These patient-friendly IEC materials should be strategically placed in locations such as antenatal clinics and labor wards, so that mothers are informed about the importance of CHX and can prepare to obtain it before delivery. HCWs also recommended tailoring resources specifically for their needs, including physical charts as reminders at workstations, along with Continuous Medical Education (CME) sessions and training programs. Observations made by the participants included the following: “But in the facility in Githunguri, I’ve not seen any [IECs]. And I think CME is about the chlorhexidine would really help in creating awareness… everywhere, in every ward, in the postnatal rooms, and in labor ward, and also here in antenatal.” (Githunguri_PNC-nurse_29) “On the issue of IEC materials, they’re not available in our facility. If they can be effective and brought down to the facilities, I would recommend they be more pictorial. By a glance, someone is able to know what it is and how it can be used and the readings big enough to be legible.” (Githunguri_ANC-nurse_33) “The IEC material would help the staff here be at least more conversant for those who are not conversant with chlorhexidine gel, its use, its application, the period which the patient is supposed to use... Through the information the staff acquire, they’ll be able to make more informed decisions of even escalating the matter to facilitate the increase of the supply of the chlorhexidine gel in the facility and also acts a refresher …as opposed to other previous methods that were used of cord care…The IECs are not available at the facility at the moment...” (Kiambu_Midwife_22) “For the charts, they should be bigger, and they should provide more charts so that we can put maybe in the wards and to educate the mothers. And for those mothers who are illiterate who cannot read, the wordings are many than the pictures. The pictures are better illustrating of how to use the chlorhexidine.” (Nazareth_Midwife_27) This study explored the experiences of HCWs in Kiambu County regarding newborn cord care and revealed significant deviations from Kenya’s national guidelines which recommends the blanket use of CHX for all neonates nationwide. Despite the increasing adoption of CHX, with 41.7% of HCWs reported transitioning from surgical spirit, outdated and potentially harmful practices such as the use of surgical or methylated spirit persisted in our set-up. One facility in our study, Thika Level 5 Hospital, adopted its own facility-based practice of dry cord care. Our findings suggests that the national policy on CHX has not been fully implemented or embraced in practice, underscoring the need for strengthened policy adherence and education. The participants in this study reported diverse experiences with the use of CHX for cord care. Key concerns included the cost of CHX products, delayed healing, and varying perceptions of its effectiveness. The cost of CHX, which was quoted between Ksh. 120–200 (USD 0.93 to 1.55), was perceived as expensive by some clients, particularly when compared to more affordable alternatives such as methylated spirit (Ksh. 50, USD 0.34) or dry cord care, which incurs no cost. This contrasts with the findings of Opanga et al., who reported that CHX gel was available at less than Ksh 40 in private facilities and pharmacies, and was free in public hospitals, yet with only a minimal uptake of 1.3% [29]. Another study conducted in rural Bungoma county found that CHX was provided free of charge to mothers after delivery, but noted that improper use and misunderstandings regarding its application negatively impacted uptake, along with echoing concerns about delayed cord separation [30]. The variations in participants’ experiences with CHX use in Kiambu County may reflect the unique socio-economic and health system dynamics of a peri-urban area situated near the capital city. While Kiambu’s proximity to Nairobi may suggest better access to health information and services, it also presents a complex interplay between urban and rural health-seeking behaviours. Unlike rural Bungoma, where CHX was provided free and uptake issues were mainly due to poor understanding or instructions, Kiambu residents may encounter CHX more frequently through private pharmacies or clinics where it is sold at significantly higher prices, making it prohibitive to lower-income households despite theoretical availability. Furthermore, price discrepancies between public and private sectors may indicate a lack of standardized pricing or public awareness about where to obtain CHX for free. This is supported by the findings of Opanga et al., which noted low uptake despite free availability in public hospitals [29]. This demonstrates a disconnect between policy and implementation, possibly fueled by inadequate dissemination of information, lack of health worker engagement, or supply chain challenges in public facilities. Despite these challenges, our results also highlighted positive feedback from HCWs, particularly around the ease of use, prevention of sepsis, and faster cord separation, suggests potential benefits. This echoes a participant in Opanga et al.‘s study who reported early cord separation, with the cord drying and detaching after just three days, highlighting the promise of CHX in improving neonatal outcomes when used appropriately [29]. The majority of HCWs interviewed indicated challenges in the provision of CHX due to systemic challenges of unavailability. The inclusion of CHX in the Kenya Essential Medicines List was intended to enhance its availability in the public sector, and this highlights a gap in enforcement of this directive in our context [22]. The overarching goal of healthcare systems is to ensure that all patients have consistent access to a comprehensive range of suitable, high-quality, and affordable essential medicines, as emphasized by the WHO [31]. Essential medicines are critical components of healthcare, recognized alongside clean water, safe food supply, and adequate housing as fundamental necessities; their absence constitutes a failure to uphold universal human rights [32,31]. However, essential medicines frequently experience stock-outs in developing countries [32,31]. In Kenya, where health services are devolved (the national government “shares” government functions with smaller county governments), the impact of these stock-outs varies across the different counties. To mitigate the occurrence of stock-outs for essential medications on the package list, it is crucial for public sector facilities to ensure timely payments to the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (KEMSA) for their orders [33,34]. Conversely, non-public facilities report infrequent stock-outs due to differing and strengthened procurement processes. Stock-outs were also identified as a significant concern by Ambale et al. at Kangundo Hospital [16]. Consequently, participants reported a lack of sustained experience with the products, which undermined their confidence in persuading mothers to purchase them upon leaving the healthcare facilities. Furthermore, to achieve optimal coverage, particularly for economically disadvantaged families, subsidization may be necessary [35]. The aforementioned issue raises a critical discussion about the disconnect between policy and implementation under Kenya’s devolved health system. It highlights that simply listing a drug as essential is not enough without effective supply chain management, accountability structures, and financing mechanisms at the county level. The situation in Kiambu highlights how inconsistent availability of essential medicines like CHX undermines provider confidence, policy adherence, and public trust, all of which contribute to missed opportunities for preventing neonatal infections and deaths. Moreover, the inequity between public and non-public facilities, where the latter have more consistent procurement systems, underscores the urgency of reforming public sector logistics and financing flows: particularly timely disbursement of funds to suppliers. Without these structural changes, the promise of universal health coverage and improved neonatal outcomes will remain unrealized. This discussion also sets the stage for recommending policy enforcement mechanisms, decentralized budgeting reforms, and stronger accountability for county health departments, as essential steps toward resolving persistent stock-outs of life-saving commodities. HCWs reported inadequate training in CHX cord care, leading to significant knowledge gaps and unfamiliarity with recommended guidelines. This resulted in variations in the reported frequency of CHX application. This finding aligns with another Kenyan study, which linked the lack of training and clear instructions to the ineffectiveness of CHX gel [16]. To address research-driven shifts, standardized guidelines for CHX use are essential. Ongoing medical education for all cord care personnel is crucial. Participants also emphasized the need for increased media publicity to enhance consumer knowledge, in line with the sensitization efforts recommended by Opanga et al. [29]. According to the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS), 89.2% of births in Kiambu County occurred in hospitals, with 98% of these deliveries attended by medical professionals [36]. This rate is notably higher than the 54% and 64% reported in Pemba (Tanzania) and Zambia, respectively [37,38]. However, having a medically assisted delivery does not necessarily guarantee a reduced risk of infection, as many medical centers in our context fail to meet minimal infection prevention standards [39]. Furthermore, potentially hazardous procedures that raise concerns in home delivery settings are often performed on women and infants before they are discharged within hours of birth [15]. While Kiambu’s high institutional delivery rate might suggest optimal conditions for newborn cord care, this can create a false sense of security if not paired with stringent infection prevention and control (IPC) measures. It challenges the assumption that health facility births inherently reduce neonatal infections and points to the critical role of CHX as a safeguard, even within supposedly safer environments. This further reinforces the WHO’s position on universal CHX application, emphasizing that the presence of a skilled birth attendant does not automatically equate to safe neonatal outcomes: especially in under-resourced or overstretched facilities. Integrating CHX as a routine part of postnatal care, regardless of delivery setting, can act as a simple, cost-effective buffer against systemic IPC failures, especially in high-volume facilities that discharge mothers and newborns within hours of delivery. Most HCWs in our study suggested several strategies to enhance the uptake of CHX. IEC is crucial for ensuring correct usage, infection control, patient safety, and adherence to best practices. Participants emphasized the importance of recommending CHX to mothers and providing education on its proper use. These sentiments are echoed in the existing literature as this resistance to CHX has been previously described in similar settings [13,30,40–42]. Both the quantity and quality of IEC materials on CHX need improvement. Visual aids and illustrations should be prioritized over text to enhance mothers’ understanding of proper CHX use. Our study found that, while most health facilities had some IEC materials on CHX, these resources were limited and lacked engaging illustrations to support learning. This finding aligns with those of the Bungoma County study [30], and further highlights a pressing need to improve these materials for HCWs. While participants rightly identified the aforementioned methods as key to increasing CHX uptake, these strategies cannot succeed without a robust and context-sensitive health communication framework. The limited, often text-heavy IEC materials reported in this study reveal a missed opportunity to engage mothers, many of whom may have low health literacy or limited formal education, in ways that resonate with their daily realities. This challenge calls for a shift from generic IEC content to co-designed, visual, and language-appropriate tools that accommodate all literacy levels. Devolution in Kenya offers both a challenge and an opportunity: counties like Kiambu can tailor CHX strategies to their unique population needs, but this must be done in alignment with national guidelines and messaging, to ensure consistency and avoid confusion. This requires capacity-building for local health workers, investment in community engagement strategies, and partnerships with trusted media outlets to amplify accurate, culturally resonant messages on CHX use. Ultimately, the effectiveness of CHX as a public health intervention depends not just on availability, but on how well it is communicated, understood, and trusted at the community level. The mixed perceptions, inconsistent use of CHX for cord care and the use of alternative cord care methods in Kiambu County reveal a deeper systemic issue that extends beyond individual preferences: it points to critical gaps in policy enforcement, supply chain reliability, and health communication. The fact that one of the facilities included in our study practice cord care contrary to national guidelines is particularly concerning and highlights a lack of oversight and accountability in guideline implementation. To ensure CHX fulfills its potential as a low-cost, high-impact intervention for preventing neonatal infections, there is an urgent need for policy action at both county and national levels. This includes: (1) strengthening the enforcement of national neonatal care protocols across all facilities, (2) ensuring uninterrupted availability of CHX through timely procurement and subsidization, and (3) developing and disseminating culturally appropriate, visually driven IEC materials to improve community understanding and uptake. As Kenya advances toward Universal Health Coverage, it is imperative that essential medicines like CHX are not only listed on paper but made reliably available and appropriately used at the point of care. A unified, well-supported CHX strategy will not only align with WHO recommendations but also directly contribute to reducing neonatal morbidity and mortality: especially among the most vulnerable populations. This must begin with aligning policy intent with health system practice.

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Young Asian couple managing finance and investment online, analyzing stock market trades with mobile ... More app on laptop and smartphone. Making financial plans. Banking and finance, investment, financial trading, mobile banking concept Still wondering if artificial intelligence will replace human workers? Well, you can stop. Because it’s already happening—and boosting corporate profits (and AI dividends) as it does. That’s tough news for workers, of course. But there’s a silver lining for those of us investing for dividends. Because the “growth-without-hiring” trend AI has touched off is setting up one of the strongest income opportunities I’ve seen in years. (I’ll name three AI plays yielding up to 8.5% below.) Wait, AI is setting the stage for big dividends? I know. AI is known for a lot of things—many of which have been, er, less than helpful, such as infringing on copyrights and forcing McNuggets on pleading McDonald’s (MCD) drive-thru customers. But dividends? Most people will tell you that AI stocks are a dividend desert. They’re not exactly wrong. Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META) pay somewhere between nothing and almost nothing. But we contrarians know to look deeper. For starters, the real AI magic isn’t in chatbots like ChatGPT. That’s surface-level stuff. It’s in applications, like the FedEx (FDX) Surround system, which uses AI to monitor and shift, if necessary, time-sensitive shipments. It’s in Meta’s recent proposal to use AI to run entire ad campaigns (including creative) based on an image of a client’s product and a budget. That could let smaller businesses access agency-level marketing, boosting their profits (and Meta’s, of course). As we mentioned earlier, yes, these changes will result in fewer hires. That’s already showing up in the numbers: Over the past year, Meta, for example, has raised revenues by 22% while only hiring 10% more people. Alphabet grew revenues by 14% without any net new hires. Sure, Nvidia did grow headcount by 13%, but for good reason—sales exploded by 126%. Microsoft, meantime, saw 16% revenue growth on just a 3% headcount increase. Tech firms are the thin edge of the wedge here. Other companies are going this way, too. This is where dividends come in because we can easily buy this trend through closed-end funds (CEFs) that: Here are three you can blend to get this sweet income (and gain!) setup. We’ll start with a “pure” tech fund and move through to one focused more on AI users than providers. The Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) focuses on tech stocks, with Broadcom (AVGO), Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet and Apple (AAPL) among its top holdings. STK also holds Visa (V) and fuel-cell-maker Bloom Energy (BE). Let’s call those “tech-adjacent.” STK sells call options on part of its portfolio, which generates extra income to support its 6.3% dividend. This strategy works well with tech stocks, as they tend to be more volatile. Moreover, portfolio manager Paul Wick has 38 years of experience and it shows: In the last five years STK’s total return has outpaced the NASDAQ, which we all know has been on a tear: STK Total Returns One thing to remember is that STK is on investors’ radar, so it trades at a premium to NAV. But that premium is well below the peaks it’s hit in recent years, making STK something of a bargain in disguise. That premium could turn some folks who don’t know STK’s history away, providing an opportunity to step in. The Nuveen NASDAQ 100 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (QQQX), as the name says, holds NASDAQ stocks. But unlike index funds, it pays a big dividend: 8.5%. Like STK, QQQX fuels its payout, in part, through option sales. QQQX’s portfolio of NASDAQ stocks includes the tech kingpins, plus firms like travel site operator Booking Holdings (BKG) that also benefit from “growth without hiring.” The fund’s 5.7% discount gives us another tailwind as it narrows and (likely, in my view) flips to a premium—something it’s long overdue for: QQQX Discount NAV Now let’s add more “tech-adjacent” holdings with … The Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust (GDV) rounds out our trio with a focus on innovators from across the economy—particularly finance stocks—set to cash in as they integrate AI into their businesses. Top holdings include Mastercard (MA), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and American Express (AXP). GDV yields 6.5% and is the steadiest payer of the bunch, with a payout that hasn’t been cut since the 2009 financial crisis. The fund’s discount has been stuck in double digits in recent years, but it has been narrowing lately. I expect that discount to keep shrinking as AI optimizes sectors like finance. That would slingshot the fund’s price higher, adding gains to that 6.5% payout. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

(“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) and reminds investors of the July 21, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify's stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding DoubleVerify’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: Bitcoin treasury hype will burst like memecoin supercycle – Crypto VC

Here’s why crypto VCs doubt whether Bitcoin and altcoin treasury trend will last. Bitcoin [BTC] treasuries and copy-cats based on Ethereum [ETH] and altcoins will be over within two years, according to Haseeb Qureshi, founder of crypto VC Dragonfly. In an X post, Qureshi linked the ‘treasury meta’ to ‘hot money’ that will end like last year’s token launch. “But hot money never stays put, which is why treasury companies will not be the final meta. But I’d guess 1-2 years of this until the heat dies down.” Source: Hosseeb/X Zaheer Ebtikar, founder of crypto fund Split Capital, echoed Qureshi’s remarks but added that the narrative will be shorter than the ‘memecoin supercycle.’ “Markets get smarter over time, and as a result, every new meta is shorter and shorter lived…Memecoin euphoria, now —> public vehicles. They all live shorter lives as a function of market forces.” Bitcoin and Ethereum treasuries collectively hold about $367 billion worth of capital as of June. Notably, BTC-focused firms hold 3.44 million BTC or $364B based on the current market price. On the other hand, ETH treasury firms have accumulated 1.16 million ETH, worth $3 billion. Notably, most of the BTC flows from public treasuries are driven primarily by Strategy and Metaplanet. However, some analysts have raised concerns that these firms’ debt leverage to acquire BTC could trigger a market crash if they go bankrupt. In response, Galaxy Digital’s Alex Thorn rebutted the claims, stating that debt concerns were ‘overblown’ because most maturities will begin in 2027. For perspective, BTC treasuries have $12.7 billion in debt, and Strategy dominates at $8.2B or 64% of the total debt. Nearly $10 billion of the debt stock is due for payment between 2027 and 2028. This timeline fits well with Qureshi’s projection, in case the bubble bursts. Source: Galaxy Research Overall, the crypto treasury meta has been printing more returns than the underlying assets, attracting most investors. However, for risk management purposes, the 2027-2028 period could be a key watchlist, especially if the firms fail to pay back their debt.

Title: Buying local a challenge for this small-town Colorado grocery store

WALSH — Everyone in Walsh wants in on the lettuce. It’s so pretty, they say to one another on the street. Way better than that iceberg stuff. And it keeps so well, they all agree. The lettuces arrive with the roots still attached. Romaine, red leaf and some silky looking butterhead, delivered the same day they’re harvested from The Summers House in La Junta. That the town has lettuce on its main drag at all has been the subject of great amazement since 2006, after a harsh year when the grocery store shuttered, and two subsequent blizzards blocked all roads to everywhere, leaving the town of 650 people stranded without a grocer. Five residents got together that fall to brainstorm ways to bring the store back. They settled on a co-op model, giving everyone in town a chance to be part-owner, and reached out to a food distributor in Amarillo, Texas, about 180 miles south of Walsh. LEFT: A family sits on a bench outside of Walsh Community Grocery Store on Saturday. RIGHT: From left, Jessica Wright, director of nutrition for Nourish Colorado, chef Taylor Frederick and Caitlyn Stuart, manager of outreach and partnerships, serve melon and cucumber salad to Baca County Sheriff’s posse member Steve Sanchez, during the store’s annual customer appreciation day. (Jeremy Sparig, Special to The Colorado Sun) “The folks at Affiliated Foods had a pool going about how long we’d last,” said Rick Mills, one of the original brainstormers and board members. “Didn’t think we’d last 10 weeks.” Walking down North Colorado Street on Saturday, during an annual town gathering called Walsh Days, Mills ran into Jamie Hume, one of the founding five, and a former board member himself. “I was just talking about the bet,” Mills told Hume. “They didn’t think we’d last six months,” Hume finished. Whether it was 10 weeks or six months, whether there was a betting pool at all, doesn’t really matter much. What matters is that they felt the odds stacked against them and made a gamble of their own, selling $50 shares and buying the Walsh Community Grocery Store back from the bank. But that story has been told: to the Denver Post, to the Pueblo Chieftain, to a PBS program called “America’s Heartland,” even to People magazine. Now 17 years in business, Walsh Community Grocery Store is entering what manager Meta Jo Riseling is hoping will be its next chapter, one where shelves are stocked with fresh food from Colorado farmers and ranchers. And she’s starting with lettuce. One of the biggest challenges of getting food to Walsh are the roads. Or, rather, the road. U.S. 160, which runs east from Trinidad and into Kansas, passing through Walsh on its way, isn’t on any local farmers’ distribution routes. So while Riseling has long had ambitions to bring Colorado agriculture into the fold, it’s taken her years to persuade anyone to make it happen. That changed in January 2024, when Riseling was invited to a LoProCO meeting, a program run by food advocacy group Nourish Colorado, which connects Colorado producers with businesses, schools and meal programs for older adults. The meeting was in Springfield, only 20 minutes west of Walsh, “so I thought, eh, I’ll go see what this is about,” Riseling said. “By the time I left I was bouncing, I was so excited. The next month I had a shareholder meeting, I was dancing all around. I made a slideshow, but the slideshow couldn’t keep up with me, I was just so excited.” What she saw at LoProCO was the opportunity to connect with Colorado farmers, to bring potatoes, peppers, meats, cheeses and leafy greens from their fields to her shelves, at a reasonable price. So far, Riseling has been able to score lettuce from The Summers House and ground beef from Bamber Ranch, a cattle ranch in neighboring Prowers County. Jaclyn Bamber-Birkelund, a fifth generation rancher, goes out of her way to deliver the ground beef from her family’s ranch to the Walsh store. They have their beef processed at Blue Ribbon in Fowler, east of Pueblo. Though the rest of her customers are along the Front Range, Bamber-Birkelund spends an extra day in the southeastern part of the state picking up beef from Fowler, driving it directly to Walsh, then crashing at her parents’ ranch in Prowers County, before heading back to Fowler for another batch, and running that to customers from Colorado Springs up to Thornton. “This is not normally a place that I come to very often, but it’s been really great,” Bamber-Birkelund said. “I love to hear from people that enjoy our product, and it’s a huge sense of pride for myself and my family.” Bamber-Birkelund is already on the hook to bring melons down from Rocky Ford when those are ready too, Riseling said. And if that doesn’t work, Riseling said she’s “talked to some folks to see if I can borrow their trucks.” Riseling started working for the store 13 years ago and worked her way into management in 2017, once she quit her job running the school lunch room. She keeps the store closely tied to the Walsh School District, which serves around 200 kids. When the lunchrooms in Vilas or Campo, nearby districts that serve around 50 students each, can’t get their hands on something, they also call her up. “(They’ll) call and say ‘Hey, I need this by this day,’ and I just say, ‘I got you,’” Riseling said. Riseling’s “got” a lot of people in town. When the nearest pharmacy stopped delivering to the nursing home because of COVID, the grocery store filled that role, bringing in medications from Kansas. “It just kind of stuck,” Riseling said. They set up an account with Western Union so locals can send money to family members in Mexico. They have delivery drivers bring groceries to elderly folks every Wednesday. “They know they can call on more than Wednesday, especially if the roads are icy,” Riseling said. She has personal numbers for most of them. If they miss a few days, she’ll call them to check in. Arguably the most important role that Riseling serves is as an unofficial matriarch in town. Beside her own three kids — the youngest worked at the store through high school — Riseling speaks cheerily about her “bonus kids,” those who have had a rough go one way or another and ended up in the Riseling living room. All three bonus kids worked at the store, too. Then there are the grocery store kids, mostly local high schoolers looking to make a summer buck and sharpen their business skills, like Elizabeth Garcia, a 16-year-old bagger. “I’ve learned so much, like how to manage money,” Garcia said. When asked what she does with her earnings, she said she’s saving it for college, a car and a house. Working has also helped her become better with people, “I’m less antisocial,” she said, nervously tugging at an armful of Mardi Gras beads she was handing out to customers. The student employees have to be decent workers, but more importantly to Riseling, they’ve got to keep good grades and listen to their parents. Anything below a C and she takes them off the schedule so they can focus on schoolwork. Riseling took her own daughter off the schedule once. “She had a D and wasn’t trying to get it brought up, so I took her off the schedule,” Riseling said, laughing. Riseling also turned to Nourish last year to set up the store with Double Up Food Bucks, a federal program that matches purchases made through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program dollar-for-dollar, to be spent on fresh fruits and vegetables, dried beans or seeds. If a SNAP recipient spends $10 on groceries, for instance, they automatically receive $10 to spend on produce. Before, the closest grocery store offering Double Up was in La Junta, two hours away. Shortly after introducing the program, one local woman approached Riseling crying in front of the store. “I was freaked out, of course,” Riseling said. The woman just wanted to express her gratitude that she could finally afford produce for herself and her disabled son. “Mimi, I got gapes! Mimi, I got nanas!” Riseling said, mimicking a young customer on another occasion, whose mother was able to buy her grapes and bananas. “Those kind of things are the reason I wanted to do that, I wanted to stretch SNAP for them,” Riseling said. LEFT: From left, Baca County Sheriff Aaron Shiplett, posse member Steve Sanchez and Deputy Lars Brahn observe Walsh Days festivities. RIGHT: Leon Bradley, left, and Kameron Wray observe Walsh Day festivities, Saturday, June 14, 2025, in Walsh, Colorado. (Jeremy Sparig, Special to The Colorado Sun) SNAP is one of the programs in President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” slated to see huge slashes in funding — the version in the Senate would punt the cost of SNAP benefits entirely to states. Though a version with major SNAP cuts was approved by the House, senators — many representing Republican states with large numbers of SNAP users — are sounding the alarm. Nourish was one of 19 organizations and politicians who sent a letter to Congress on June 13, expressing concern about the SNAP cuts, that included signatures from the Colorado Department of Agriculture, Colorado Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association and Gov. Jared Polis. More than 600,000 Coloradans receive SNAP benefits each month. In February, Rick Mills gave up his board seat, the last of the original five board members to do so. The meetings aren’t as packed as they once were, Mills said, and many of the board members stayed on for years because it was hard to find replacements. “But, you know, things in a small town, they change over time,” he said. For the first time in about 50 years, Mills isn’t on any town boards, a fact he mentions proudly and repeatedly. But he stays busy, with cattle at the commercial feed lot, with small business ventures, and with world travel. As much as he lights up talking about Machu Picchu — “that place was magic” — or Santiago, Chile, where he was detained by security for accidentally smuggling in a Slim Jim, he’s just as lit up talking about his single story home 4 miles outside of town, where he spends evenings soaking in the hot tub and watching the night sky. “It’s just real comforting to know that something like this worked, and that it keeps so many people at home,” Mills said. “When you go to another grocery store, you’re not going to save any money. You’re going to see so much more than what we carry here that you’re going to spend a lot more money. So it’s going to cost you more in the long run to go to a bigger town. We have everything we need here.” Walsh Based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.

Title: The Trump family's licensing

Good morning! Add sequel fatigue among moviegoers to the growing list of things we can blame the Marvel Cinematic Universe for. At least, that's according to "28 Years Later" writer Alex Garland. In today's big story, the Trump family's plans for a new mobile phone company is the latest example of businesses tied to the president's last name. What's on deck Markets: How the Israel-Iran conflict could spell bad news for stocks. Tech: Inside the billion-dollar war over 'peace tech.' Business: Target's sales are struggling. BI reporters visited three stores to see what the biggest issues were. But first, can you hear me now? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The Trump family just made a call on its next big business, and it's hoping you'll do the same. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump announced plans for a Trump-branded mobile phone service and smartphone, writes BI's Brent D. Griffiths. Dubbed Trump Mobile, it's a familiar business model in the world of Trump Inc. — a licensing agreement allowing for the use of the Trump name with plenty of nods to the president. The unlimited talk, text, and data plan is called the "47 plan" and will cost $47.45 a month, an homage to Donald Trump's run as the 47th and 45th US president. Meanwhile, the business' smartphone, the T1 Phone, will run you $499 when it's available in September and is gold colored (of course). Trump Mobile's website also touts the fact that the phone is made in America, an interesting distinction considering the questions swirling about the potential cost of a made-in-USA iPhone due to tariff concerns. Trump-branded services and products have existed for decades, but merchandise bearing the president's last name certainly hasn't slowed down in recent years. From sneakers to Bibles to cologne, Trump hasn't been shy about lending out the family name for the right price. There is one new twist to Trump's long-standing love of merchandising. Crypto has been a goldmine for the president and his family, including the sale of NFTs and memecoins. Now, Trump's media company is looking to dive deeper into the crypto world with the launch of a bitcoin and ether ETF, writes BI's Jennifer Sor. Trump Media filed documents with the SEC for approval of the ETF, which will aim to be 75% bitcoin and 25% ether. The news comes just a few weeks after the company announced plans to raise $2.5 billion to buy crypto, joining a growing number of companies holding digital assets on their balance sheets. Launching an ETF is a bit more complicated and costly than just buying up bitcoin. One Morningstar analyst previously told BI an ETF costs around $200,000 a year to run. Trump Media's ETF also comes at a time when there has been an influx of famed investors and analysts, from Dan Ives to Nouriel "Dr. Doom" Roubini, pushing into the space. Trump still has more name recognition than just about anyone. But that doesn't guarantee success. After all, how people feel about the Trump name varies greatly. One early data point on the potential ETF isn't looking good. Following the announcement, Trump Media's stock finished the day down about 4%. 1. How the stock market could take flak from the Israel-Iran face-off. Flaring tensions in the Middle East could drag the S&P 500 down by 20%, RBC said. The bank named three ways that could happen: risk to valuations, impact on sentiment, and inflation driven by rising oil prices. 2. Billionaire trader Paul Tudor Jones sounds the alarm on AI. Although AI has great potential, Jones recently warned that the technology could spark mass unemployment and even eradicate the human race. He also said that AI should be regulated. 3. Is the Fed moving too slow? Markets predict more than a 99% chance the Fed will keep rates steady this week, but some economists worry that waiting to cut rates might be a mistake. They pointed to weakness in the labor market and tariff uncertainty as concerns. 1. Can AI predict — and prevent — war? The founders of the peace-tech startup Anadyr Horizon think it can, by creating AI versions of world leaders and seeing how they act in simulations.

Title: Welcome to Peak Palantir

The company that ” knows everything about you” is going from strength to strength as war rises and and the so-called “liberal” West turns into a dystopian novel. Amid all the controversy generated by Trump’s $45 million birthday military parade on Sunday, with some claiming it was a giant flop while others insist it was a roaring success despite the low turnout, one thing appears to have been largely overlooked: Silicon Valley’s role in part-bankrolling the event. As The Verge reports, while taxpayers footed the bill for the soldiers, tanks, and planes at the parade, several major tech firms helped pay for the “festivities” along the parade route. They included Oracle, Amazon, Coinbase, Meta, all with close ties to the Trump administration, and Palantir, Silicon Valley’s darkest unicorn which aspires to one day operate the US government’s common operating system. A number of blue-chip sponsors also pitched in, such as Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram, Coca-Cola, Walmart, BNY, Goldman Sachs and Exiger. However, it was Palantir’s logo that was beaming from video boards above President Trump’s head. With soft rock guitar solos playing in the background and tanks rolling past the cheap-looking stage, accompanied by patrols of robot dogs, the scene had all the glamour and style of a low-budget Hollywood sci-fi from the mid-1980s. If Trump was looking to project a message of power to the world, it was a spectacular failure. But there was still plenty of menace on display. Parade announcer: "Special thanks to our sponsor, Palantir" pic.twitter.com/OKcsaDUB7X — FactPost (@factpostnews) June 14, 2025 Palantir said in an emailed statement on Sunday that the company “proudly supported yesterday’s celebration of the Army’s” 250th anniversary “alongside some of America’s greatest companies.” Palantir Joins the Army Palantir’s star is rising rapidly under Trump 2.0 while its shares hit record highs on an almost daily basis. The firm’s co-founder and chair of the board, Peter Thiel, was one of relatively few Silicon Valley moguls to bankroll Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, and now it looks like he’s cashing in. Thiel is also a former employer-cum-mentor of Vice President JD Vance, whose senate run in Ohio Thiel almost single handedly funded with a record breaking $15 million donation. In other words Thiel’s influence would probably be greater in a Vance administration. Palantir is involved in a new Pentagon initiative aimed at spurring innovation within the US army, titled Detachment 201. As Defense News reports, Shyam Sankar, Palantir’s chief technology officer, was one of four Silicon Valley tech execs invited to join the US Army Reserve as lieutenant colonel, to help inject their speed and expertise into the army’s military innovation. The other three Army Reserve lieutenant colonels were from Meta, Open AI and Thinking Machines Lab. Granted, Silicon Valley has always been closely intertwined with the MIC and the CIA, with many big-tech firms, including Palantir, receiving seed funding from the CIA’s investment arm, In-Q-Tel. But in the case of Palantir, the connections run deeper. The company essentially began life as an unofficial spin-off from DARPA’s Total Information Awareness (TIA) Program, which was ostensibly shut down in late 2003 when Congress decided that building a comprehensive surveillance program for all US citizens was perhaps a tad excessive, even in the post 9/11 era. In reality, TIA would serve as the prototype for sweeping surveillance programs later developed by the NSA, and exposed by whistleblower Edward Snowden. Meanwhile, Palantir was created, with CIA seed funding (like so many Silicon Valley firms), to be the privatised version of TIA. Now, its CTO has just enlisted in a new special corps within the US military. In an op-ed for the Free Press Project, Sankar notes that it would have been unthinkable for so many tech heavyweights to openly align with the US military just a decade ago: Equally, it would’ve been out of character for the military to enlist the support of the nation’s business elite — much less to create a special corps so that they could deploy their technical talents in service of the government. But a sea change has taken place in both places because of the urgency and seriousness of the moment. Wars in Europe and the Middle East and, above all, the threat of a war in the Pacific have focused the national mind and initiated a scramble for mobilization. Exploding pagers and long-distance drone strikes from shipping containers prove that technology has once again changed the battlefield. Our military has to change with it. As luck would have it, Palantir is a leading expert in exactly these kinds of technology. As leaked Los Angeles Police Department training documents revealed, its Gotham software collects and churns through huge reams of personal data, from gender, race, names, contact details, addresses, prior warrants, mugshots, surveillance photos, personal relationships, past and current employers, tattoos, scars, piercings and other identifying features. The company says its programs help users to spot hidden relationships and networks, uncover terrorist activity, and even predict attacks. The darker the world grows, the richer the pickings for this increasingly menacing (but still relatively little known) company. It wasn’t as if there weren’t warnings that this day — the day of peak Palantir — would come, even from some mainstream media outlets. In 2018, during Trump’s first term, Bloomberg published an in-depth piece titled: The subheading: Peter Thiel’s data-mining company is using War on Terror tools to track American citizens. The scary thing? Palantir is desperate for new customers. A couple of paragraphs: Founded in 2004 by Peter Thiel and some fellow PayPal alumni, Palantir cut its teeth working for the Pentagon and the CIA in Afghanistan and Iraq. The company’s engineers and products don’t do any spying themselves; they’re more like a spy’s brain, collecting and analyzing information that’s fed in from the hands, eyes, nose, and ears. The software combs through disparate data sources—financial documents, airline reservations, cellphone records, social media postings—and searches for connections that human analysts might miss. It then presents the linkages in colorful, easy-to-interpret graphics that look like spider webs. U.S. spies and special forces loved it immediately; they deployed Palantir to synthesize and sort the blizzard of battlefield intelligence. It helped planners avoid roadside bombs, track insurgents for assassination, even hunt down Osama bin Laden. The military success led to federal contracts on the civilian side. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services uses Palantir to detect Medicare fraud. The FBI uses it in criminal probes. The Department of Homeland Security deploys it to screen air travelers and keep tabs on immigrants. Police and sheriff’s departments in New York, New Orleans, Chicago, and Los Angeles have also used it, frequently ensnaring in the digital dragnet people who aren’t suspected of committing any crime. People and objects pop up on the Palantir screen inside boxes connected to other boxes by radiating lines labeled with the relationship: “Colleague of,” “Lives with,” “Operator of [cell number],” “Owner of [vehicle],” “Sibling of,” even “Lover of.” If the authorities have a picture, the rest is easy. Tapping databases of driver’s license and ID photos, law enforcement agencies can now identify more than half the population of U.S. adults. If Palantir knew everything about us in 2018, it presumably knows even more today, after purportedly participating in Elon Musk’s DOGE “clean-up” of government spending as well as an effort to build a new “mega API” for accessing Internal Revenue Service records. Palantir has also found new customers along the way, including an array of government departments, from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to NHS England, as well as banks, other tech firms, insurance providers, Wendy’s and a resurgent NATO. A company that aspires to be “in every missile (or drone)” and whose CEO, Alex Karp, openly brags about helping to kill “mainly terrorists”, has found fertile room for growth in both the US’ private healthcare industry and the UK’s publicly owned NHS. While two-thirds of its sales are still US-based, the company is rapidly expanding its overseas operations, particularly to the UK. As we noted a couple of months ago, the Trump and Starmer governments may differ wildly in terms of style, language and professed ideals, but they have some key things in common: Both are looking to transform their respective countries into AI powerhouses while also launching similar full-frontal assaults against basic democratic rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech and the right to protest. Both have launched brutal crackdowns on protests against Israel’s genocide of Gaza (and both are now fully behind Netanyahu’s reckless war on Iran). A Leading Financial Indicator for Dystopia and War In fact, one would be hard pressed to find a more reliable financial indicator for dystopia and war in the collective West than Palantir Technologies’ company stock. Note how the graph has steepened in recent months. In May, as the wars escalated in the Middle East and Eastern Europe and as ICE intensified its raids against undocumented workers, Palantir was the S&P 500’s top-performing company. Since Trump 2.0 took over in late January, the company’s shares have almost doubled. In the past year alone, they are up 470%. To put that in perspective, the S&P’s Aerospace & Defense Select Industry Index has offered returns of just 40% over the same time period. Granted, Palantir has one of the highest P/E ratios on the planet, at 617. The P/E ratio compares a company’s share price with its earnings per share, and is often used to determine the relative value of a company’s share in side-by-side comparisons. The fact that investors are willing to invest so much in a company that is still earning so little, relatively speaking, suggests they see a bright future ahead for the AI-empowered surveillance and control technologies that Palantir specialises in. In other words, they are going long on war overseas and repression at home. Palantir was already receiving shovel loads of contracts from governments, particularly in the US, the UK and Israel, long before Trump returned to office. In February 2022, Palantir was hired by the Biden administration to manage Covid vaccine distribution. A year later, it was awarded a $447 million contract to develop a federated data platform for the National Health Service. It now has 24 contracts with UK public institutions including the Ministry of Defence, the Police Force, the Cabinet Office, and the DLUHC. However, as Kit Klarenberg details for the Gray Zone, Trump 2.0 has massively expanded Palantir’s work with the US’ government sector, using the company’s tech to break down information silos within government, making it easier for agencies to share data on US residents: On May 30th, the New York Times published a lengthy probe linking these deals to an executive order signed by Trump in March, calling for seamless, mass sharing of data across government agencies through a Palantir application called Foundry. The report did not explain to readers how Palantir emerged as a small startup thanks to sponsorship from the CIA’s venture capital wing, In-Q-Tel, which gifted Peter Thiel’s company $2 million in 2004. Instead, the paper leaned in to a partisan angle playing on Democratic fears that Trump could abuse a unified database to target political foes. Nonetheless, the Times provided valuable insight into Palantir’s penetration of a vast array of US government agencies, by raking in more than $113 million in federal government spending since Trump took office, on top of “additional funds from existing contracts as well as new contracts with the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon.” In late May, the company’s existing contract with the Department of Defense was beefed up by $795 million, bringing it to an eye-popping total award of $1.3 billion. Palantir currently provides the Pentagon with AI targeting software known as Maven, which it uses in battlefields from Syria to Yemen to Ukraine and beyond. The contract will last until at least May 2029. The Trump administration’s fondness for Palantir has placed its data analytics and storage tool Foundry in at least four federal agencies, including the DHS and Health and Human Services Department. Talks are also apparently ongoing with the Social Security Administration and Internal Revenue Service to adopt the resource. This would facilitate merging all these agencies’ datasets. As we warned a couple of months ago, Palantir aspires to become the US and the UK governments’ central operating system by (in the words of its CTO, now a lieutenant colonel in the US army) expanding its “footprint across defence, healthcare and civilian agencies”: As outlandish as the idea may seem that one company could aspire to exclusively provide and manage a central operating system for the governments of both the US and the UK, there can be no doubting Palantir’s ambitions to expand its influence throughout government on both sides of the Atlantic. This is a company, after all, whose founder, Peter Thiel, has long marketed himself as a libertarian while lauding the benefits of monopoly capitalism and helping build the infrastructure of the modern surveillance state. As Iain Davis writes in his excellent two-part series on the “Dark MAGA Gov-Corp Technate”, the “proponents of Technocracy and the proponents of the Dark Enlightenment, such as Elon Musk and Thiel, are not interested in restricting state power, though they may say otherwise”: Instead they wish to move the state from the public to the private sector and expand its power once sufficiently privatized. True, they oppose “representative democracy” and characterise it as both a “democracy” (which it isn’t) and a bureaucratic system riddled with problems (which it is), but the solutions they offer, to all intents and purposes, magnify the power of the very state they supposedly condemn. What the believers in Technocracy and the believers in the Dark Enlightenment both propose are compartmentalised, hierarchical sociopolitical power structures that couldn’t be more state-like or more authoritarian. They seek to expand and maximise the power of the state, though in slightly different ways. Calling their new model of the state either a Technate (as technocrats do) or a gov-corp (as accelerationist neoreactionaries do) doesn’t change the nature of the tyrannical statism they desire to foist on the rest of us. Good vs Evil One of the most bizarre aspects of Palantir’s rise to dominance is its unflinching belief in a Manichean world order, and that everything it does, including helping the Israeli army build kill lists for the Israeli forces’ genocide in Gaza and helping the US deport undocumented migrants, is for the side of good. Thiel and Karp seem to genuinely believe they are in the vanguard of a revolution in both technology and governance — one that will save Western civilisation from external threats while transforming it into something very different, something much darker. Even back in 2010, it was clear what side Palantir was really on: Palantir was hired by Bank of America in 2010 to target WikiLeaks. Their plan, later leaked to WikiLeaks, included hacking, disinformation and smearing supporters including @ggreenwald. pic.twitter.com/Y1p0DkI3ER — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) June 11, 2025 In March, the company launched a recruitment campaign on university campuses with black billboards inviting students to join their mission “to ensure America’s future”, closing off with the words: “we build to dominate”. “We are dedicating our company to the service of the West and the United States of America,” Karp said during an investors call in February. “[We are] here to disrupt and.. when it’s necessary to scare enemies and, on occasion, kill them.” Karp also said that Palantir was “building really great things”, in order “to power the west to its obvious innate superiority”. Not everyone agrees. In the UK, for example, several senior officials at a number of NHS trusts have cautioned that Palantir’s technology was inferior to current systems, and could actually hamper NHS work. Palantir has always had an ace up its sleeve, however: the corrupting influence of revolving-door politics. In this sense, it is following the playbook of many of the blue-chip defence contractors it seeks to replace. As the FT reports, “Palantir is profiting from a ‘revolving door’ of executives and officials passing between the $264bn data intelligence company and high level positions in Washington and Westminster, creating an influence network who have guided its extraordinary growth.” Palantir is also active in one of the most secretive and influential forums of Western power politics: the Bilderberg Group. Thiel has long been a member of the group’s steering committee and was recently able to secure Karp a seat at the table. Granted, we will probably never know what was said at this year’s conflab, held last weekend at Stockholm’s Wallenberg-owned Grand Hotel, thanks to the private nature of the meeting and its use of the Chatham House Rule. But we do know what topics were under discussion thanks to a list provided by the organisers. They included the “transatlantic relationship”, “Ukraine”, “the US economy”, “depopulation and migration”, the “authoritarian axis”, and the Middle East, just a day after Israel launched an all-out offensive against Iran. This is a war that Palantir is also directly participating in, reports Klarenberg: For years, Palantir has been at the heart of US-led efforts to neutralize Iran’s alleged nuclear program. It has created a predictive analytical tool dubbed Mosaic for the purpose, used by the International Atomic Energy Agency and US officials to visualize ties between the people, places and material involved in the Islamic Republic’s nuclear activities. Data harvested and pored over by the resource includes potentially tainted material supposedly stolen from Tehran by Mossad. In a recent episode of System Update, Glenn Greenwald describes Palantir as having “an almost unprecedentedly influential role in America’s deep state and its intelligence apparatus and security state.” He notes how Karp* is becoming increasingly vocal about his belief system revealing himself to “be a hardcore neo-con, as devoted a loyalist to Israel as it gets,” and a firm believer in American war. Perhaps, just perhaps, Palantir’s coming out of the darkness in recent times will be its ultimate undoing. Otherwise, this may not be peak Palantir at all, but rather the beginning of its dominance of the government institutions and systems we partly all pay for. * While Greenwald focuses almost all his attention on Karp, describing him as the “sole controller and manager of Palantir,” he largely downplays the role of Palantir’s founder and current chair, Peter Thiel, describing it as “quite minimal”, which I believe is debatable. While Thiel no longer holds an executive role at Palantir, he is still chair of the board. It’s also worth bearing in mind that Thiel is one of the main shareholders of Rumble, the platform on which System Update is primarily hosted. For what it’s worth, JD Vance is also a major shareholder. This is a great article Nick, thank you. “Techno-feudalism.” “Techno-fascism.” “Authoritarian capitalism” (with a “techno” face). There are a lot of labels floating around for where we are headed. I wish the world of “dystopian” novels was not becoming reality so quickly. Thanks much for this. I’m not optimistic, but it’s much better to know what’s happening to us while it is still possible to obtain such information. I fear most of us are happily marching like lemmings into this world of infotainment soma, Brave New World style. But at some point the curtain to which Frank Zappa famously referred will be pulled back and we’ll be in 1984. The accelerating derangement of our political “leaders” makes me think that this could be soon, unless people wake up. That is one hell of an epilogue, or rather a punchline, in the footnote about Greenwald there. Just when you think you’re getting too cynical. Indeed. I have been watching some shows on Rumble so as not to give traffic to the evil tech overlords at Google/Alphabet. I didn’t realize Thiel was a shareholder at Rumble at all, and I do try to keep up. Thanks Nick for opening the aperture so people can peer through and see what the “future of the west” looks like from the perspective of the tech bro feudal lords. I, from my non-western perch, can only watch with mounting horror as the purveyors of death and mass surveillance sequester power at a rapid pace under Trump and his poodles Starmer, Metz et al. The shareholders of Palantir will make out like bandits as they continue their relentless assault on the liberties that westerners hold so dear while at the same time manufacturing external “enemies” around the world to justify the stock price. Scary stuff… Yes Nick, many thanks. Everyone is so focussed on the bad guys (Trump, Putin, Netanyahoo, Biden, ICE ……) they don’t realize what’s happening. I’m sharing this with liberal friends who marched against Trump over the weekend. I can only hope that the general public can shift its focus off of the NYT and onto the “real” news. One can hope. NC = real news. Thanks for this article. You wonder at what point that Palantir will change their name to the Umbrella Corporation. I get the impression that all this is predicated on more and more server farms opening up consuming energy and water like crazy so that all this work can get done. Of course in war time I think that they will find themselves vulnerable. In the meantime it looks like government are hiring them as hired guns who ask no questions. A country’s bureaucracy may question certain actions and may be examined in a public inquiry but a corporation like Palantir? Sorry, that privileged client-customer information. Our contract says that we cannot give you any answers – ever. Definitely if too many people start recognizing the name its time to change it Here is a very deep dive in Palantir and Military AI: https://www.projectcensored.org/silicon-valley-military-ai-weapons/ I’m not impressed with the gigo concerns in that linked article. Humans make tons of mistakes in war at all different levels of decision making, and enemies have been confusing each other forever. These AI and robot tools offer incredible war-fighting potential (incredible in the sense of effective killing and recon capability) and come with drawbacks, but obviously not sufficiently bad drawbacks to deter intense R&D. Putin awhile back said the Russians are treating AI as on par with nukes in terms of strategic impact. The US has a massive achilles heal because the gov’t tolerates a level of corruption that leads to massive military overspending and underperforming, which seems much less of a problem in Russia and china, relatively. But that’s a problem wholly independent of AI. Gifting top military rank to a bunch of nut-job Silicon Valley grifters — one of them born in Mumbai — on the eve of that Pyongyang-on-the-Potomac Army drag-show for Donny Bone-Spurs is simply more evidence of the Orwellian caste-based caudillismo into which America is sleep-walking. In the Panopticon to be run by the AI-educated minions of We Build to Dominate no one will be spared, even if you paid for one of their private club memberships. Karp’s murderous threat “to scare enemies and on occasion kill them” is nothing but a pseudo-intellectual beard on the End Times mentality of rationing and hoarding epitomized by Joseph Borrell’s notorious “most of the rest of the world is a jungle, and the jungle could invade the garden” quip. Tripoli, Raqqa, Bakhmut, Gaza, — next Tehran. Will your neighborhood be next? Man, so easy to unplug… Remember the 1990s, when nobody had a cellphone…? The lunatics have taken over the asylum, but can they build a new one to hold the rest of us? Palantir thinks so, but Palantir has been wrong rather often. Your email address will not be published.

Title: AppLovin Stock: Worth It At $365?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. The AppLovin Corporation logo appears on a smartphone screen in this illustration photo in Reno, ... More United States, on December 20, 2024. (Photo by Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images) AppLovin (NASDAQ:APP), a firm that assists mobile app developers in publishing and promoting their applications, has excelled over the past year, though it has experienced some ups and downs in 2025. While the stock dropped nearly 57% from the peaks observed in early February 2025 following a report from a short-seller claiming AppLovin violated service terms and exaggerated the success of its e-commerce operations, these claims have yet to be substantiated, and the stock saw a strong recovery after reporting solid earnings in the first quarter. The stock is currently approximately 7% up year-to-date in 2025 and has increased nearly 4.5x over the previous year. Demand for Axon 2.0, AppLovin’s exclusive machine learning algorithm for ad placement, has surged. The software effectively determines which ad to show, to which user, and at what time in order to optimize click-through rates or user engagement. While this resembles the strategies employed by Meta and Google, Axon is specifically designed for mobile app advertising. The company’s advertising platform reported impressive revenue growth of 71% year-over-year in Q1 2025, achieving $1.16 billion. Overall financial results have also been strong, with revenue soaring nearly 40% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA experiencing an increase close to 83%. Although the bulk of the company's revenue still comes from advertisements for mobile gaming applications, it is concentrating on expanding its e-commerce sector. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain how effective this initiative will be, as AppLovin possesses an extensive dataset in gaming but may lack the comprehensive first-party e-commerce data that competitors like Meta and Alphabet have. That being said, despite its impressive growth and success, the AppLovin stock may be a challenging choice at its current price of approximately $360. We believe there is little reason for concern regarding APP stock, which makes it appealing, but it is also very responsive to negative events due to its elevated valuation. We reached this conclusion by comparing APP’s current valuation with its operational performance over the past few years, as well as its current and historical financial positions. Our evaluation of AppLovin according to key metrics such as Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience indicates that the company possesses a very strong operational performance and financial standing, as elaborated below. Nonetheless, if you are looking for potential with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers a viable alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and delivered returns greater than 91% since its founding. Separately, see – Should You Buy CRWV Stock After A Whopping 4x Rise? Based on the amount you pay per dollar of sales or profit, APP stock appears to be very expensive relative to the overall market. • AppLovin has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 25.1 compared to a figure of 3.0 for the S&P 500 • Additionally, the company's price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) ratio stands at 50.8 compared to 20.5 for the S&P 500 • Furthermore, it has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 67.1 compared to the benchmark’s 26.4 AppLovin’s Revenues have substantially increased over the last few years. • AppLovin has experienced an average revenue growth rate of 23.2% over the last 3 years (versus an increase of 5.5% for the S&P 500) • Its revenues have risen 41.6% from $3.6 billion to $5.1 billion in the past 12 months (compared to a rise of 5.5% for the S&P 500) • Moreover, its quarterly revenues increased by 40.3% to $1.5 billion in the most recent quarter from $1.1 billion a year prior (versus a 4.8% increase for the S&P 500) AppLovin’s profit margins are significantly higher than most companies within the Trefis coverage universe. • AppLovin's Operating Income over the last four quarters was $2.4 billion, indicating a significantly high Operating Margin of 46.5% (compared to 13.2% for the S&P 500) • AppLovin's Operating Cash Flow (OCF) for this period was $2.5 billion, indicating a significantly high OCF Margin of 49.4% (versus 14.9% for the S&P 500) • For the last four-quarter span, AppLovin’s Net Income was $1.9 billion - reflecting a significantly high Net Income Margin of 37.4% (compared to 11.6% for the S&P 500) AppLovin’s balance sheet appears solid. • AppLovin reported a Debt figure of $3.7 billion at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $124 billion (as of 6/13/2025). This results in a very strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 2.9%(in contrast to 19.9% for the S&P 500). [Note: A low Debt-to-Equity Ratio is preferable] • Cash (including cash equivalents) constitutes $551 million of the $5.7 billion in Total Assets for AppLovin.
