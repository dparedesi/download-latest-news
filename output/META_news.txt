Title: Wall Street’s advice after Nvidia hits historic $4 trillion market cap: BUY
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/07/10/is-nvidia-a-buy-4-trillion-market-cap/
Time Published: 2025-07-10T15:56:39Z

Paolo Confino is a reporter on Fortune’s global news desk where he covers each day’s most important stories. Wall Street is betting Nvidia can make stock market history again. After the chipmaker powered its way to a $4 trillion valuation, the first company to ever reach the milestone, analysts still see room for the stock to grow. The upside for Nvidia, according to its biggest bulls, remains incomplete. There are more returns to be had, they argue. Nvidia is one of the most beloved stocks by investors. It seems to have ridden the stock market exuberance of AI more than any other company. Investors continue to reiterate its strength as the purveyor of the best AI chips that hyperscalers like Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon use. Of the 79 analysts who currently follow Nvidia, 69 rate it a buy, according to Bloomberg. That’s good for an 87% buy rating among analysts. Only 11 rate it a hold. And just one lone holdout lists it as a sell. On Thursday, after Nvidia hit the $4 trillion mark, some analysts were unfazed at the prospect that perhaps the chipmaker had reached its stock market peak. At least three analysts published new reports rating the stock a buy, according to Bloomberg data. Goldman Sachs, Keybanc Capital Markets, and Bocom International, the subsidiary of Hong Kong’s Bank of Communications, all listed Nvidia as either a buy or an overweight. Their price targets ranged from $175 to $190, implying growth of between 8.1% and 17.4% for Nvidia stock from the $161.84 per share at the time of publication. Despite Nvidia’s valuation, its fundamentals don’t point to an expensive or overpriced stock, according to Paul Meeks, chief investment officer at 17 Asset Management. “The stock has come far, but sales, earnings, and cash flows have come farther,” he told Fortune. Indeed, Nvidia has delivered outstanding financial performance. Its latest quarterly earnings saw it bringing $44 billion in revenue, a 69% increase from the prior year, according to company filings. Its margins remain plump, coming in at 60% over the same quarter. Its balance sheet remains rock-solid with $111 billion in total assets compared to $32 billion in total liabilities in its 2025 fiscal year. Goldman was undeterred by Nvidia’s recent record valuation. It called worries about Nvidia’s sky-high price “peak concerns” in an analyst note published on Thursday. “We believe Nvidia will remain the primary beneficiary of the ongoing AI infrastructure buildout,” Goldman semiconductor analyst James Schneider wrote. Analysts built their bull case for Nvidia around the fact that it remains the market leader in all the components used to develop AI systems and that the market for all of those products will only grow over the next few years. Nvidia has also spent the last couple years diversifying its offerings. “Nvidia’s well beyond the chips,” Meeks said. The company also has a suite of software and networking gear used for things like gaming and developing robotics. Nvidia’s believers also often point to early signs that AI companies are finally starting to monetize the technology. Once that happens, demand for Nvidia’s products will only grow. AI firms have already started to push further into the consumer tech market. Perplexity released an AI-powered web browser and OpenAI is slated to launch one soon. Major cloud service providers like Amazon and Alphabet will also start to incorporate more AI tech into their services which will only further boost Nvidia’s sales, according to longtime tech bull Dan Ives. “The impact of the AI cycle on consumer Internet will be massive and it will start with the cloud service divisions,” Ives wrote on Thursday. “[Amazon and Alphabet] acquire AI-capable chips, build AI-capable service offerings, and sell those services into their respective installed bases.” But Nvidia’s fate is ultimately linked to that of its biggest customers. As they continue to spend, the stock will continue to soar. The day that they pull back their billions in AI investments is the day Nvidia’s gets “crushed,” Meeks said. “Only thing that would cause a bloodletting here is if we got a sense that major AI spenders pull back,” he said. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Meta is trying to win the AI race with money — but not everyone can be bought

﻿Zuckerberg is picking off top talent from across the industry, and OpenAI might be more vulnerable than most. ﻿Zuckerberg is picking off top talent from across the industry, and OpenAI might be more vulnerable than most. Month after month, message after message, the AI engineer was hearing from Meta recruiters. The recruiters were pestering him to leave his employer and switch over to support the company’s AI efforts, and they were offering a sizable salary package to do so. But he wasn’t so sure. The engineer, who works for a startup that was acquired by a leading AI company and requested anonymity from The Verge, said he had heard from friends that the company expected a lot of personal sacrifices in exchange for its high salaries, whether on employees’ value systems when it comes to Al or work-life balance. Engineers there, he heard, were working around the clock to catch up with rival companies like OpenAl, Anthropic, Google, and Microsoft. With so many firms desperately scrambling for AI talent, Meta was offering between $1–1.4 million in total annual compensation (which is typically measured as a combination of salary, annual bonus, and amortized stock value) for many AI roles. But, he suspected, its offers might be less generous than they sounded — tied heavily to subjective performance metrics that could be weaponized against employees. And just as importantly, he wasn’t willing to give up a semblance of work-life balance and a healthy work environment to make a few hundred thousand dollars more. He didn’t pursue the opportunity. In recent months, Meta has launched on an AI hiring spree after making its largest-ever external investment: a $14.3 billion acquisition of a 49 percent stake in Scale AI, an industry giant that provides training data to fuel the technology of companies like OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and Meta. As part of the deal, Meta spun up a brand-new superintelligence lab led by Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang — and to staff the lab, it started poaching. Meta has reportedly poached as many as 10 of OpenAI’s top researchers and model developers, with some pay packages reportedly adding up to $300 million over four years, including equity. (Meta disputes this figure.) It’s also approached a slew of other top AI talent across the industry. Ruoming Pang, who heads up Apple’s foundation AI models team, reportedly departed for Meta, and at least two Anthropic employees and two DeepMind employees have reportedly joined the team as well. The goal is to secure Meta’s spot in the race to achieve artificial general intelligence, or AGI: a hypothetical AI system that equals or surpasses human cognitive abilities, and the moving target that almost every AI company is currently chasing at breakneck speed. Meta’s primary weapon is vast amounts of money. But some sources across the AI industry question whether that will be enough. Meta, to date, has not been the most exciting destination for budding AI engineers Meta, to date, has not been the most exciting destination for budding AI engineers. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been trying to make up for lost ground in the AI race, having spent years and significant resources over-indexing on the metaverse while competitors like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon invested billions in AI startups and signed cloud contracts and other deals. The company’s Llama AI models often rank low on publicly maintained performance leaderboards; at time of writing, Meta’s first appearance on one such leaderboard, Chatbot Arena, was at No. 30. In May, it reportedly delayed the launch of its new flagship AI model as developers struggled to deliver performance upgrades, and executives have been public on earnings calls about the need to aggressively invest and shore up against competition. The Scale AI deal, and Meta’s subsequent sky-high budget for hiring AI talent, is Zuckerberg’s Hail Mary: paying a premium for some of the brightest minds in the AI world to safeguard Meta’s future. But although Meta is plying AI workers with staggering salaries, a mountain of money can’t buy everyone. Anthropic and DeepMind have reportedly had far fewer defections to Meta than OpenAI has, and that’s been an ongoing trend. The reason, to those inside the field, is obvious: the AI world is filled with true believers, and even the biggest companies need more than a cash offer to get many of them on their side. Industry insiders emphasized to The Verge that in a sector where almost any company will offer job security and a good salary, experienced AI engineers and researchers want to work somewhere that aligns with their values, whether their top priority is AI safety and the risks the tech poses for humanity’s future, the ethical considerations of AI’s impact on society today, or accelerating and advancing the tech quicker than anyone else. Some engineers, researchers, or scientists the company has approached have turned down Meta’s advances, industry sources tell The Verge. Competition for AI researchers is stiff, and building loyalty is vital. “At this point, at least a few hundred top researchers and engineers in the field are what’s sometimes called ‘post-money’ — they could retire, and you’re only going to attract or retain them if they believe in your vision, leadership style, etc.,” one AI industry source says. But especially at OpenAI, Meta seems to have found the dollar value of company loyalty — and exceeded it. OpenAI has been uniquely affected by Meta’s mission to poach leading AI talent. As many as 10 of its top researchers and model developers have reportedly joined Meta, with some receiving large signing bonuses and equity. While its size and talent make it an inevitable prime target, the company is also vulnerable due to a controversial restructuring from a nonprofit to for-profit venture and the departures of high-profile executives who went on to start competing AI companies. It underwent a huge upheaval during Sam Altman’s November 2023 ouster by OpenAI’s board and his subsequent Uno Reverse-style rehiring, which saw most of the board members who opposed him resign. Employees have also shared concerns about non-disparagement agreements and policies that raised questions about whether they would be able to access their equity, eroding some trust in leadership even when the policies were walked back. “A lot of the people working on this are genuinely convinced they’re building transformative technology that will reshape the world,” one source familiar with the situation tells The Verge. “For the people that were that mission-driven, there’s already been so much organizational turbulence” — he mentioned Altman’s firing and rehiring, OpenAI employees defecting to Anthropic, and governance changes — “that people are less anchored to the institution itself, so it’s easier to poach [from OpenAI] than the other labs.” In lieu of an official comment, OpenAI directed The Verge to a blog post from its global affairs team, which states, “Some eye-popping offers are being extended these days to a handful of terrifically talented researchers, including to folks at OpenAI. Some of these offers are coming with deadlines of just a few hours – literally ‘exploding offers’ – or with restrictions on whether or how they can be discussed.” The blog post goes on to say the company plans to cultivate talent across not just research, but also product, engineering, infrastructure, scaling, and safety. On Wednesday, the company announced it had hired four engineers away from companies like Tesla, xAI, and Meta. Now, OpenAI’s best defense against the losses is its own financial leverage. People that joined OpenAI early on, or even before the end of 2023, have had significant stock appreciation — the unit price jumped from $67 in a May 2023 tender offer to $210 at the end of 2024, according to a source familiar with the situation. And during the end of 2023, around the time of the OpenAI board roller coaster, there was a window in which OpenAI rushed to make hires from other companies who would sign on at the $67-per-unit figure, since there was a near-immediate 2.5x multiplier expected, the source says. With so many companies competing to hire AI talent, there have been high-level departures at many different companies. But even before this most recent hiring frenzy, OpenAI’s employees were being lured elsewhere at a higher-than-average rate. A 2025 SignalFire report analyzed retention patterns in AI and found that Anthropic was best at keeping people around, with 80 percent of employees hired at least two years ago at Anthropic remaining at the company at the conclusion of their second year. DeepMind came next at 78 percent, while OpenAI’s retention rate was markedly lower, at 67 percent — comparable to Meta’s 64 percent. The report, which came out in May before Meta’s Scale deal occurred, also found that engineers were “8 times more likely to leave OpenAI for Anthropic than the reverse,” and 11 times more likely to defect from DeepMind to Anthropic than the reverse. Anthropic was founded by ex-OpenAI research executives with the goal of carefully developing AI technology, describing itself as an “AI safety and research company that’s working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems.” The company’s “mission-driven safety focus” is a convincing recruitment pitch and a key reason for its low turnover, one source familiar with the situation tells The Verge. “The priorities of the companies become very different, and it’s not something that they’re happy with” “I’ve seen, amongst people who are a little bit more seasoned in industry … they have watched tech as an industry change, and they’ve watched the people in the industry become very different, and the priorities of the companies become very different, and it’s not something that they’re happy with,” says Rumman Chowdhury, a longtime leader in the field of responsible AI at companies like Accenture and Twitter, who now heads up the AI nonprofit Humane Intelligence. When she’s hiring AI engineers, she says, they often say that salary hikes are less important to them than to “not be contributing to a worse world.” AI engineers and researchers can afford that idealism, and concerns about safety and the rush to commercialize the technology have dogged most leading AI companies. At OpenAI, for instance, months of controversy and public pressure about its upcoming transition into a for-profit entity led to the company changing its plans, ceding some control to its nonprofit arm even after the restructuring. The decision followed a public letter written by ex-employees and civic leaders to the California and Delaware attorneys general, with one former employee writing, “OpenAI may one day build technology that could get us all killed.” There are questions, too, about the pace at which Meta is moving and its research priorities. Meta’s Scale AI investment came on the heels of Joelle Pineau’s departure as Meta VP and head of its Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) division, a unit Meta folded into its larger AI efforts after previously describing it as “one of the only groups in the world with all the prerequisites for delivering true breakthroughs with some of the brightest minds in the industry.” Some saw FAIR’s restructuring as a sign that Meta was prioritizing products over research, an industry-wide concern for some AI safety experts. For Meta, however, there are also pragmatic questions about its future in AI. In conversations with The Verge, industry insiders questioned whether Wang is the right choice to head the new lab, since Scale AI does not build frontier models and Wang himself doesn’t have an AI research background. And even Meta executives admit that catching up will be a challenge. During its most recent earnings call in April, Zuckerberg — who called one of Meta’s focuses for 2025 “making Meta AI the leading personal AI” — touched on the competition he was up against. “The pace of progress across the industry and the opportunities ahead for us are staggering. I want to make sure that we’re working aggressively and efficiently, and I also want to make sure that we are building out the leading infrastructure and teams we need to achieve our goals,” he said. Just two months later, that team became Meta’s superintelligence lab. But the AI engineer who steered clear doesn’t regret his decision. “You’re expected to give pretty much your whole self to Meta AI,” he says. The money simply wasn’t good enough for that.

Starting off with a bang for our UK readers, Amazon has come in clutch and is offering a bona fide 10% discount on the excellent PlayStation Portal handheld device. Deals and discounts have been incredibly hard to come by on the remote play PS5 streaming device, so this is absolutely worth shouting about. I love the Portal too, and it really has given me an extra way to tackle my backlog from the comfort of the sofa, or while away. UK - PlayStation Portal: was £199.99 now £179 at Amazon Good morning and welcome to the last day of the Amazon Prime Day gaming deals of 2025. Today marks the last chance to grab something extra for your setup, add a cool game to your backlog on the cheap, or go for that big upgrade you've been considering. We're still seeing some belting discounts across all platforms and devices so use all those links above and we'll continue posting some awesome deals in our live coverage. I'm about to head off for the day, but not before I draw your attention to one of the very, very best deals that I've seen so far. The Sony Inzone H3 is a great headset from the PlayStation maker, offering easy plug-and-play compatibility and support for spatial sound. It performs well too, with fantastic audio quality and a flip-to-mute microphone that's ideal for chatting with friends. It's a decent deal at its regular $99.99 price, but this limited time offer knocks over 52% off! That takes it down to under $50, where it absolutely decimates the competition. If you're planning to buy a headset over Prime Day and don't want to spend a lot, then make sure that it's this one. US - Sony Inzone H3: was $99.99 now $48 at Amazon It just hit midnight here in the UK, which means that we are now officially on our final day of the latest Prime Day sale. If you need a quick recap, the event is running from July 8 to the end of July 11. This means that now is a good time to start pressing the purchase button if you've been stocking your basket, as there's no word on how long any deals could stick around once Prime Day comes to an end. We're also coming up to the final stretch of savings in the US, with less than 34 hours to go. Interested in a handheld PC? Then you should take a look at this ASUS Rog Ally bargain. The powerful system is currently hovering just 99p above its lowest-ever price at Amazon in the UK, which is an absolutely mega saving. Thanks to AMD's powerful Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip, you'll be able to enjoy a wide range of triple-A games at a 1920x1080 resolution on the crisp 7-inch 120Hz refresh rate screen. In our testing, it achieved an impressive 60 fps in Cyberpunk 2077 after some graphical tweaking, with even better performance for those willing to make use of frame generation. UK - ASUS ROG Ally: was £518.42 now £399.99 at Amazon The well-received Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl has crashed down to a record low price for Prime Day. Right now the Xbox version can be yours for a whopping $36.59 off - beating the previous record low by a considerable margin. This post-apocalyptic survival adventure won't be for everyone, but fans of atmospheric and haunting experiences will absolutely love it. It features intense, realistic survival mechanics and a grounded world that's brought to life by modern high-end graphics. US - Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl: was $59.99 now $23.40 at Amazon Don't sleep on this incredible Razer Kishi Ultra discount. In my book it's by far the best mobile controller on the market, as long as you don't mind splashing out a bit. It offers an unbeatable level of comfort thanks to its full-size controller grips and offers no shortage of premium features. You get USB-C passthrough charging, full-size thumbsticks, Hall effect triggers, mechanical buttons and a clicky D-pad, and even some customizable RGB lighting strips. Where this mobile controller really leaves the competition in the dust though is its software, which is packed with useful additions including the ability to mimic on-screen commands with buttons to enable compatibility in titles that don't natively support a controller. It's an absolute game-changer for things like League of Legends Wild Rift. US - Razer Kishi Ultra: was $149.99 now $99.99 at Amazon Now this is a bit of a shocker: the PlayStation Portal has received a 10% discount in the UK. That might not sound like much, but it takes it down to a new lowest-ever price and is by far the best PS Portal deal that I've seen yet. The streaming handheld is a popular choice for PS5 owners, letting you play games straight from your console via the internet. It's not quite a PSP replacement, but it can come in clutch when you need to free up the TV for someone else. Its design is excellent too, effectively offering two sides of a DualSense Wireless Controller sandwiched around a screen with all the expected features like rumble, adaptive triggers, and more. Best of all, you don't even need to be a Prime member for this offer! UK - PlayStation Portal: was £199.99 now £179 at Amazon This is a US deal that I'm really jealous of. The Special Edition version of the superb Horizon Forbidden West has dropped to its lowest-ever price and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in trying the popular PlayStation series. Set in a futuristic open-world in which you have to survive against vicious, animal-like machines, it's ideal if you're craving a big, meaty experience that will keep you occupied for weeks. Although this is a sequel to Horizon Zero Dawn, no knowledge of that prior game is required to enjoy it. The Special Edition also nets you a SteelBook, mini art book, and a digital soundtrack to enjoy. US - Horizon Forbidden West Special Edition: was $79.99 now $39.99 at Amazon I've spotted another budget-friendly headset in the Prime Day sales, this time the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 1 - which is down to a new lowest-ever price! Compatible with PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch, it offers plenty of adjustability and a retractable noise-cancelling microphone. Although nothing special the sound is decent for the price. Where this headset really wins, however, is in its comfortable ski-band head strap design and plush ear cushions. UK - SteelSeries Arctis Nova 1: was £59.99 now £31.34 at Amazon Getting into the world doesn't have to be expensive - just look at this affordable microphone from HyperX. The HyperX SoloCast is currently on sale for a lowest-ever price in the UK, with a whopping 30% off. It's rare to see items from trusted brands like this at such low prices. The main reasons to pick the SoloCast is its ease-of-use: this is a simple, plug-and-play microphone that delivers impressive sound right out of the box. The tap-to-mute sensor and adjustable stand are also great inclusions at the price range and make recording or even just chatting with friends a breeze. UK - HyperX SoloCast: was £36.89 now £25.64 at Amazon We consider the Meta Quest 3S to be one of the very best VR headsets on the market, scoring five stars in our review, where we called it "the only VR headset you need" whether you're completely new to VR or an experienced headset owner. It strikes the perfect balance between performance, practicality, and price. Over Amazon Prime Day, that price tag has got even more tempting, however, with a record discount available right now. In you've been waiting for the chance to dive into the world of VR gaming, you shouldn't pass on this. US - Meta Quest 3S: was $299.99 now $249 at Amazon UK - Meta Quest 3S: was £289 now £237.99 at Amazon If you're still using your Nintendo Switch and want to get a little bit Peely with it, then accessory maker PowerA has you covered. This neon yellow carrying case is based on the iconic Fortnite character and even comes with a code for an in-game item. It fits the original Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch OLED, and Nintendo Switch Lite, with built-in storage space for games, small accessories, and even a little padded stand. The current offer is also the lowest price that this model has ever been, though only a few cents. US - PowerA Protection Case for Nintendo Switch (Fortnite Peely): was $22.99 now $12.29 at Amazon Right now you can grab the Atari 7800+ at an absolutely incredible 54% off - taking it down to just under $60 at Amazon. For that price you get a fully-featured retro-style games console, plus a controller and an original game cartridge for Bentley Bear's Crystal Quest. On top of this, the console supports original Atari 2600 or 7800 game cartridges, so it could be perfect if you want to grow your own retro collection or have some old games lying around. US - Atari 7800+: was $129.99 now $59.99 at Amazon Hey everyone! Dash again, back to take over. I'm currently scanning the web for the latest gaming deals, so bear with me for a few moments as I hand-pick the very best ones to share... If, like me, you were an early Nintendo Switch adopter, you might find your console is getting a little long in the tooth. But if you''re not ready to upgrade to the Switch 2 just yet, you're in luck: one of the best accessories released for the Switch Gen 1 is now available at its lowest ever price. The Nitro Deck is the perfect way to give your handheld a bit of an update. Slot your screen inside it and it'll give you more ergonomic grip and protect your Switch from knocks. But its biggest benefit is it will banish that annoying stick drift with its Hall effect thumbsticks – something I've experienced more times than I'd like the recall. As a gamer of a certain age, I have very fond memories of my GameCube so I particularly love the purple Nitro Deck on offer here, although both the gray and mint colorways are also on offer. US - CRKD Nitro Deck: was $79.99 now $47.99 at Amazon UK - CRKD Nitro Deck: was £59.99 now £47.49 at Amazon Another bargain PS5 game now and one that's at its lowest price ever in the UK – and not far off in the US. A spiritual successor to the Zoo Tycoon series, Planet Zoo puts you in charge of your own menagerie, allowing you to handcraft your own exquisite animal exhibits filled with everything from Aldabra giant tortoises to western lowland gorillas. Confession time. I'm an enormous PlanZoo addict: I've racked up a truly disgusting 1,200 hours in the game and have no intention of stopping any time soon. Part of what makes the game worth investing your money – and an enormous amount of time – in its the creative freedom it gives you. If you love being able to obsess over details to create your dream zoo, it's a really rewarding experience. It's already offers a huge amount of playtime for a pretty modest spend. And with this deal, that value gets even harder to ignore. US - Planet Zoo (PS5): was $49.99 now $34.99 at Amazon UK - Planet Zoo (PS5): was £39.99 now £19.94 at Amazon Hi there! Josh here, now taking over the live blogging to give Dash a quick break. I've been working behind the scenes all Prime Day writing up deals so I'll be bringing you some of my favorite options from across the sales over the coming hour. So without any further ado... Okay, this is a bit of a weird one but might be worth checking out if you're using Prime Day as a chance to stock on gifts. Gaming brand HyperX makes a mini headset designed specifically for kids, and it's currently on sale for its lowest-ever price. I had the chance to try it out at Gamescom last year and, while it absolutely didn't fit on my massive gamer head I can attest to its durability. The headset is seriously flexible and didn't so much as creak when I tried my hardest to snap it into pieces in front of the horrified PR representative. Its hard-wearing materials aside, the headset is compatible with all major platforms thanks to the 3.5mm headphone jack and comes in a range of attractive colorways. US - HyperX Cloud Mini Kids: was $29.99 now $19.99 at Amazon The critically acclaimed Split Fiction has received a massive lowest-ever Prime Day discount and should be in your basket! The co-op action-adventure game came out back in March, so a deal this generous is a real surprise. It received the full five out of five stars from us here at TechRadar Gaming, which is very rare indeed. We loved its innovative mechanics and the seemingly endless variety of different playstyles crammed into the game. It's also visually stunning, pulling off both sci-fi and fantasy settings with impressive fidelity. Just bear in mind that this is a co-op only game before you buy - you can't play it solo in any capacity. Luckily, each copy comes with a handy 'Friend's Pass', which allows you to play with a buddy who doesn't own it at no additional cost US - Split Fiction (PS5): was $49.99 now $35 at Amazon UK - Split Fiction (PS5): was £44.99 now £30.99 at Amazon Time for one of my personal Prime Day favorites! Every year we see massive discounts on the fantastic Backbone One mobile controller and the ongoing sale is no exception. If you're after a versatile mobile gamepad, then I would highly recommend it. It's a fantastic all-rounder and the perfect companion if you're planning some travel and need something to keep you entertained in a pinch. Right now the best price is on the PlayStation Edition, which comes in an attractive white colorway and has DualSense Wireless Controller themed buttons. US - Backbone One, Playstation Edition: was $99.99 now $69.99 at Amazon UK - Backbone One, Playstation Edition: was £60 now £40 at Amazon Another wired Xbox controller deal here with the Thrustmaster Heart. This unique-looking controller is named after its H.E.A.R.T. anti-drift thumbsticks, which incorporates Hall effect technology for enhanced durability and precision. On top of this, it features two remappable rear buttons, mechanical face buttons, and even a customizable RGB lighting strip right down the middle of the pad. It's currently the lowest-ever price it's been in the UK with a £28.25 discount for Prime Day! UK - Thrustmaster Heart Controller: was £89.99 now £61.74 at Amazon The Razer Blackshark V2 X is a fantastic gaming headset that comes personally recommended by our Hardware Editor Rhys Wood. It's the headset that he uses every day, as it offers the perfect balance of audio quality, microphone performance, attractive design, and affordability. Right now it's just a few bucks off its lowest-ever price and is a fantastic pick if you're looking for a capable gaming audio device that isn't going to completely empty your wallet - leaving you with some left over cash to spend on even more Prime Day gaming deals! US - Razer BlackShark V2 X: was $59.99 now $36.08 at Amazon UK - Razer BlackShark V2 X: was £41.99 now £32.99 at Amazon The Scuf Valor Pro is an excellent controller from a seriously well-regarded brand. It boasts a number of features that make it a perfect fit for Call of Duty games, including adjustable triggers, remappable rear inputs, and in-built audio controls. This is a wired-only model, which might be a shame for some, but comes in at a more affordable price than other Scuf products. At the moment, it's even been discounted down to lowest-ever rate for Prime Day. US - Scuf Valor Pro: was $109.99 now $85.49 at Amazon Hello gamers! Dash here to take things over on the live coverage front. I've been trawling the sale for the last few days, so have plenty of bargains to share with you. Sit back, relax, and get ready for some deals. I'm going to start off strong with a personal pick... Right, I'm actually stepping away from our live coverage for a bit now leaving you in the capable hands of my gamer colleague Dash. I will be here again tomorrow though, so until then, happy deal hunting! There's never a bad time to get another controller into your setup as a spare or just to grow or fill out your collection stylishly. As a result, the discounts this Prime Day on Xbox Wireless Controllers are both easy to recommend and worth investing in if you're on the hunt for a new pad. US – Xbox Wireless Controller (Black): was $64.99 now $47.49 at Amazon UK – Xbox Wireless Controller (Black): was £59.99 now £49.99 at Amazon Speaking of adding things to existing setups that make things better, this is something I've recently added to my PS5 Pro setup and have been seriously impressed by: the Creative Sound BlasterX G6 USB sound card. Traditionally, I've always been a wireless-only kind of guy for my setup, but since testing this out and going back to a wired headset for a bit with it, I'm not sure if I can game any other way now. The sound difference and quality the G6 has given me on PS5 is exquisite and has made the audio of Death Stranding something almost otherworldly. What's more, it's now down to a record low price in the UK and a heavily discounted price in the US. Nice. US – Creative Sound BlasterX G6: was $179.99 now $139.99 at Amazon UK – Creative Sound BlasterX G6: was £129.99 now £81.59 at Amazon To take a small diversion from my own personal gaming picks, this one is an absolute belter if you're on Nintendo Switch - especially in the face of Switch 2 stock being hard to find. If you've ever wanted your OG Switch to perform and look a bit better on the big screen, then this is the device you should invest in: the mClassic upscaler. It'll take your low resolution images and bump them up while simultaneously polishing them right up. Simple but very effective. US – Marseille mClassic: was $99.99 now $74.99 at Amazon UK – Marseille mClassic: was £99.99 now £69.88 at Amazon However, if you prefer a headset, then let me direct you to the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X which is currently enjoying brillianlty low prices on both sides of the Atlantic. This is one of the best value, and best overall packages of a headset that I can remember testing, and given the superb audio quiality and limitless compatibiltiy of the Nova 5X, this is a no brainer for anyone looking for a headset this Prime Day.US - SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X: was $149.99 now $99.74 at Amazon UK – SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X: was £129.99 now £89.99 at Amazon The first deal I want to highlight is on one of my most favorite bits of gaming gear of the past couple of years. Simply put, the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds are the best gaming earbuds money can buy in my view, and now that they've reached historic low prices as part of the Amazon Prime Day gaming deals, there's literally never been a better time to pick them up. No matter your platform, if you're after some buds, these are the ones to go for. US – SteelSeries Arctis Gamebuds (Black; Xbox): was $199.99 now £147.99 at Amazon UK – SteelSeries Arctis Gamebuds (Black; Xbox): was £159.99 now £118.74 at Amazon I'm going to get the ball rolling with some of my absolute top picks for the best Prime Day gaming deals I've spotted. These are going to be on some of my favorite games that I've played and bits of gear that I've tested - a theme of our overall approach here as my colleagues will be doing the same. We will absolutely still be highlighting discounts and deals more broadly though - there's so much good stuff out there, after all! Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the very best Prime Day gaming deals that you can spend your money on right now.

Title: If I ran X
URL: https://werd.io/if-i-ran-x/
Time Published: 2025-07-10T13:54:17Z
Full Content:
How to transform the internet's most toxic platform into essential infrastructure. “After two incredible years,” Linda Yaccarino tweeted, “I’ve decided to step down as CEO of 𝕏.” It was the day after the company’s AI chatbot, Grok, began calling itself MechaHitler and started spewing antisemitic slurs and advocating for Adolf Hitler in public until the company eventually had to remove them. Many of the users still posting to X greeted the antisemitism warmly; some tweeted, “finally”. No new CEO has been named. I’ve previously written about what I’d do if I ran Bluesky product, Mastodon, my own platform, and a fund supporting the open social web. I’d intended to stop the series there. But as there’s an opening: let’s imagine I was handed the reins to the most toxic mainstream social network. What would I do if I was the new CEO of X? I have some history with the people behind Twitter, the site that eventually became X. I consider multiple people who were there at the site’s inception, as well as many people who worked there in its later years, to be friends; Biz Stone sat on my first startup’s advisory board; I worked for Ev Williams at Medium for a little while. I’ve heard various pieces of founding stories from each of them. And I really loved using Twitter. Long before Elon Musk bought it, I was an addicted user who posted many times a day. It opened up communities for me: I attended Twestivals (and hosted one), saw Ben Walker play his Twitter Song live, took part in countless hashtag games and still own a tote bag I won from the literary magazine Granta for writing a tweet-length horror story. Every time I went to an industry event or a conference, I’d be in the Twitter backchannel, making and reading observations, and building new connections. And then, one day, Elon Musk walked into the building carrying a kitchen sink and began to refashion it around his need to amass power and influence to bring about his edgelord, pronatalist, Hitler-saluting view of the world. The name changed to X, Musk’s original name for PayPal, a company whose board voted to fire him as CEO due to mismanagement. Musk fired 80% of the staff, cratered the morale of the people who remained, reinstated Nazi accounts, hate speech surged — and the rest is history. I’ve been given the reins. I’m CEO now. Can it be saved? Throughout this tumult, X’s active user numbers have remained remarkably steady. 2024’s 335.7M monthly active users represented a 9% drop from 2022, the year Musk acquired Twitter. TechCrunch recently reported that its web views remain vastly higher than new competitors like Threads and Bluesky. Famously, many brands and journalists have been reticent to leave the site, despite its near-constant onslaught of white supremacy and hate speech. In other words: the traffic is there. These users may be a mix of bots, literal Nazis, and people who don’t mind posting on a site that is heavily used by literal Nazis, but there are hundreds of millions of them. So that’s something. On the other hand, its revenue tanked following the acquisition, with some reports showing a drop as big as 66%. More recently, it saw 17.5% growth between 2024 and 2025, but it needs to claw back a lot of ground if it wants to return to its 2021 revenue peak — and even then, it posted a loss for most of the decade that preceded it. In short: its online culture is toxic, its finances are decimated, and morale at the company is through the floor. But there is a great deal of remaining traffic, and many stalwarts have refused to give up followings they spent over a decade building. If we want to turn it around, the only place it’s possible to start is the culture of the company itself. Everything else flows from there. First, let’s address the ketamine in the room: there is no possible cultural turnaround at X while Elon Musk owns the site or has a significant stake. It must be acquired from him. That may seem far-fetched, but much of his wealth is stored in Tesla stock; in a world where his political machinations tank the price of his cash cow, he may need liquidity through other means. X’s valuation had already declined by 80%; his own xAI acquired it at a relative discount. As X’s culture continues to degrade, it may prove to be a drag on the valuation of his AI startup. The benefits of offloading it, in other words, may begin to outweigh the benefits to keeping it. A coalition of hands-on investors would be needed to perform this acquisition, but consider the upside: a de-Nazified Twitter would be worth considerably more than its current incarnation. Musk had previously taken it private; the revived company could once again be floated on the stock market. The potential gains would be significant. A newly-independent X would then be ripe for change. Executives and managers who were loyal to Musk would need to be removed. It’s not a given that other employees were fully on board with his “extremely hardcore”, hard-right ideology: some may have needed to remain to maintain their visas or to ensure a paycheck in a tough hiring environment. Internally, diversity policies and mandatory inclusion training would return. Protections for work-life balance would return, and remote work would once again be allowed, with a staged roll-out. Work would be undertaken to establish an internal culture of empathy, which is a hard requirement for building non-toxic communities; experts like Carole Robin and Vernā Myers would be heavily drawn on for ongoing manager training and culture guidance, and experts like Dr Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru would be drawn on to help the company be mindful the implications of ongoing work. This is the work of years, but the process would begin immediately. To be clear, it’s not that employees would need to be left-wing. This isn’t an inquisition, and a company culture that only allows one political alignment is more harmful than good. But basic human decency would once again be a value: hate speech and bigotry would be explicitly disallowed, and it would be made obvious that the aim of Twitter’s platform is to create a community where voices from a diversity of communities should feel safe to post, which starts with internal cultural expectations. Nazi accounts would need to be banned again, swiftly, with their posts preserved internally in a vault in a de facto legal hold. The messages would be made available as a dataset to organizations that research and investigate hate groups, although users would have the ability to have their content removed in accordance with relevant privacy legislation for their jurisdiction. Significant investments would be made into non-profits and on-the-ground organizations that support the vulnerable communities harmed by the hate speech, doxxing, and other activities previously enabled on X. A commitment would be made for ongoing support: it couldn’t be a one-and-done gesture. A permanent, inclusive trust and safety council would be established, modeled after the Supreme Court, with real, encoded power to affect company policies around content and moderation. This council and its permanence would be defined in the articles of association of the new company; it would be almost impossible to remove them. Its members would be guaranteed a salary (but could not own stock) and required to both adjudicate on content moderation issues and intervene during strategic lapses. The number of members of the council would increase based on active users but could never decrease. Employees who objected to these measures would be free to take a buyout. Some would likely just quit. Meanwhile, the company would begin to aggressively hire across the board, including but not limited to engineering, product, research, design, partnerships, communications, and trust and safety. Public statements and heavy PR would signal the internal cultural changes in order to attract new applicants. The name and brand would be symbolically restored to Twitter, indicating a clean break from the Musk years. It’s a trustworthy brand, and the change back would likely turn heads. But it would be a mistake to simply return the company to its old self. The new Twitter needs to be something else entirely. It’s now clear that Musk’s acquisition was about amassing power, not providing value. As Dan Primack wrote in Axios last year: While this might seem like a selling point to a would-be autocrat, it serves as a weakness to Twitter as a business. Not only does this property make it vulnerable to takeovers from terrible people, but it elevates the company’s business decisions to a level where a mistake could significantly impact democracy or even public safety around the world. (This is also the lesson Meta failed to learn in Myanmar.) In turn, this could subject the company to greater regulatory scrutiny and oversight. It may seem like value at first sight, but it’s actually a business risk. So how can the new Twitter be incredibly valuable but also safer from regulatory oversight? The core value of Twitter is not its social network as such. That’s always been a means to an end. The vast majority of content on the site has historically been created by just 10% of users, but people don’t log in to post: they want to see what other people are saying. The point of Twitter is to find out what’s going on right now and get an insight into the conversation around it. My new Twitter would retain the social network but expand upon the idea that people want to know what’s happening right now. The feed would expand to not just include Twitter’s own conversations, but every public conversation across the social web. Search, trending topics, and live dashboards would represent the entire addressable real-time web, using open standards and protocols like AT Protocol, ActivityPub, and RSS. Twitter would become the way to find out what’s happening everywhere. Some social networks — like Facebook — would not be available via this feed. The addressable social web would consist of sites that embrace open protocols (best), or otherwise make a content deal directly with Twitter (less good). However, a Twitter that aims to provide the pulse of the internet and not necessarily a social network in itself is less of a competitor to closed networks; in fact, the tools may provide new engagement and users for them. The aim would be, over time, to make not being represented on the feed more of a business liability for closed social networking platforms than being included. Twitter would provide libraries, ecosystem support, and even funding for open social web protocols: its value increases as the the social web pie gets bigger. Monetization would be three-prong. Advertising would remain on public feeds, and a renewed focus on trust and safety would improve brand safety, bringing advertising prices back up. Twitter Blue premium profiles on the social network would remain. But most differently, enterprise tools for tracking public sentiment and yielding unique insights from the global conversation would be made available for corporations, media companies, and governments. These tools would also be made available to public research institutions, with some restrictions, for free. Using open protocols should help reduce regulatory risk. In this world, trust and safety is as much about de-listing external content as it is about policing the in-house social network. Aggregating across the entire social web is an enormous infrastructure task that requires real resources and expertise to carry out; the compliance demands across global jurisdictions are complex but fully within Twitter’s wheelhouse. The moat for the business is, in part, the combination of the difficulty of building the tools and their ease of use for end users. In-house expertise would create proprietary machine learning algorithms for sentiment and insight analysis, and integrations with third-party tools like CRMs and analytics platforms could embed the platform in existing enterprise ecosystems. It’s a very similar model to how Google originally became the dominant search engine: simplicity of use combined with the sophistication of its internal technology, all layered over the open web. It’s not even particularly unprecedented: Blaine Cook, then CTO of Twitter, was fired for demonstrating interoperability with Jaiku, another social network. For this new Twitter, interoperability would be core to its value. This transformation wouldn’t happen overnight. A still-aggressive but more realistic timeline might look like: Once established, the new Twitter would set the tone for the social web itself. By implication, it wouldn’t just be the way that conversations were discovered; people would find platforms this way, too. By not hyper-focusing on its own social network, it has the potential to become a much bigger and more valuable company: one that people use to unlock the entire online social conversation. By using open protocols, the company ensures the whole internet isn’t locked into its services, but by caring for trust and safety, design, and the quality of its feeds, it provides best-in-class options for people to choose. And it fosters a bigger, more interesting social web in the process. Does X or Twitter actually need to be saved? Absolutely not. There are plenty of new social networks that are more interesting, more fun to use, and show more promise. But there’s interesting potential here, both to remove a major source of toxicity on the internet, to diffuse a centralized source of power that can be abused by autocrats and oligarchs, and to create a way to elevate the entire social web. So that’s what I would do if I was CEO. "I do not have the time or emotional energy to screen out regular attacks by Large Language Models, with the knowledge that making the wrong decision costs a real human being their connection to a niche community." It's wild to me how many people are still engaging with X. As more people look to AI to learn about the world, the people who control how it's trained and how it responds will control our prevailing narratives. That's wildly dangerous. Forget San Francisco - I wish every single US city would do this. We're too car-dependent, too isolated, too unhealthy. (Honestly, European mixed-use development should be the model.)

Title: NVIDIA became the first $4 trillion company — here's how the tech giant beat Microsoft and Apple

The AI arms race drove NVIDIA to become a $4 trillion company. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. NVIDIA was briefly worth $4 trillion this week. The tech giant passed that milestone and became the first $4 trillion company following a 2.5% increase in stock value at one point on July 9, 2025. The valuation of NVIDIA has since dropped to around $3.97 trillion. NVIDIA began 2025 behind Microsoft and Apple, but steady growth has pushed NVIDIA past other tech giants. Growth is expected to continue for NVIDIA. The company provides computing power for several of the biggest AI tools, which has proven quite lucrative for the GPU maker. NVIDIA's surge to a $4 trillion valuation is due largely to the company's dominance in the AI space. As companies race to integrate AI into everything from computers to personal assistants, the demand for computing power increases. Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI, Google, and other companies release AI-powered products regularly and have integrated AI into existing services. Microsoft was reportedly NVIDIA's largest customer in 2024, outspending Meta, Google, and other tech giants. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. ChatGPT launched in 2022, sparking an AI arms race. NVIDIA's value has increased fifteenfold since OpenAI released its AI-powered tool. "Global demand for Nvidia's AI infrastructure is incredibly strong. AI inference token generation has surged tenfold in just one year, and as AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate," said NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang when discussing financial results in May 2025. It was more than an initial surge for NVIDIA. The tech giant reached a $2 trillion valuation in February 2024 and then passed the $3 trillion mark just four months later. NVIDIA's stock price now sits around $163, though that will fluctuate throughout the week. Shares are up about 22% on the year for NVIDIA. NVIDIA stock dipped slightly, dropping the company's value to just under $4 trillion. But given recent trends, it is likely NVIDIA will pass the milestone again. It's more than NVIDIA stock that's risen over the last few years. The company brought in $44.1 billion in revenue in the financial quarter ending in April 2025. That was a 69% year-over-year increase for the tech giant. Sean Endicott is a tech journalist at Windows Central, specializing in Windows, Microsoft software, AI, and PCs.

Title: Forbes Daily: Nvidia Reaches A $4 Trillion Milestone
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellechemtob/2025/07/10/forbes-daily-nvidia-reaches-a-4-trillion-milestone/

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. AI juggernaut Nvidia just crossed another milestone: a $4 trillion valuation, the largest in history. The firm, which was worth just over $10 billion a decade ago, now outranks household names like Microsoft, Apple and Amazon, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard in training advanced artificial intelligence programs. It’s hard to grasp just how much money $4 trillion is, but for some context: The company of less than 40,000 people is now worth more than 97% of the world’s economies, the entire New York area real estate market and the combined net worth of the 30 richest people in the world. Linda Yaccarino X CEO Linda Yaccarino announced her resignation Wednesday, just one day after Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok made a series of antisemitic comments on the social media platform—though a source told NBC News that the exit has been in the works for over a week. On X, Musk wrote: “Thank you for your contributions,” in response to the former advertising executive’s departure after a two-year stint leading the company. It’s unclear who will succeed her. MORE: Later Wednesday night, xAI launched the latest and most advanced version of its AI model: Grok 4. In a nearly hour-long livestream, Musk and xAI staffers demoed the new model, which Musk said was “smarter than almost all graduate students in all disciplines, simultaneously.” The billionaire did not address Grok’s recent controversial posts. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell Good news for investors eagerly awaiting lower borrowing costs: Most Federal Reserve officials still expect interest rate cuts this year, according to minutes released from its recent meeting, but tariffs could complicate the Fed’s efforts to fight price increases. Still, many members of the central bank’s rate-setting panel noted that the inflationary impacts of tariffs could be more limited if trade deals are reached soon. As President Donald Trump suggested he’d implement a 50% tariff on copper imports, the price of the metal skyrocketed in its largest intraday surge since the 1980s, before paring back some of its gains Wednesday. The levies would likely increase prices for copper in the U.S., analysts predicted, as just over half of the total refined copper consumed in the U.S. is imported. MORE: Higher copper costs could also lead to an increase in crime, as the metal would become a valuable target for thieves. It’s the third-most consumed metal in the U.S., with uses ranging from electrical wiring in buildings to computers and cars, and is often stolen from construction sites. Critics of President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” argue that it takes from the poor to benefit the wealthy, but not all billionaires are celebrating its passage. Some of the bill’s measures are more likely to help multi-millionaires than billionaires, and a number of the world’s richest people are concerned about the expected $3.4 trillion that will be added to the deficit by 2034 as a result of the legislation. One estate planning attorney told Forbes some of his billionaire clients are moving more of their wealth offshore to “more stable economies.” Adam Valkin, who helped grow General Catalyst into a global venture capital powerhouse, wants to help Israeli founders break into the U.S. market in his new role at Vine Ventures. Valkin will help the firm invest in the country known as “Startup Nation,” as—despite experiencing a drop in investments after the October 7 attack—Israeli startups have raised $3.1 billion so far in 2025. After Shaun Maguire of Sequoia Capital received swift backlash for his comments about New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, a letter supporting the venture capital firm partner garnered hundreds of signatures. The letter defending Maguire claims his remarks, including accusing Mamdani of being an “Islamist,” did not constitute hate speech, even as nearly 1,000 tech founders demanded Sequoia take disciplinary action. Carlo Ancelotti Former Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti has been sentenced to one year in prison and will pay a hefty fine after being found guilty of tax fraud. He had been accused of failing to pay over $1.1 million in Spanish taxes related to image rights. Managing Real Madrid is a big deal in the world of professional sports—the team topped Forbes’ list of The World’s Most Valuable Soccer Teams in 2025, the fourth year in a row it ranked No. 1. Billionaire Bill Ackman’s wildcard entry into the Hall of Fame Open tennis tournament ended in swift defeat Wednesday, drawing criticism from fans and officials who questioned whether the hedge fund manager had earned his spot in the professional event. Participants in the tournament are typically selected based on ATP rankings, wildcard entries and qualifiers. Randy Walker, the director for the Vero Beach Futures tennis tournament, posted on X after the match: “I just watched the absolute worst professional tennis match I have ever seen.” Photo by Matt Roth for The Washington Post via Getty Images Even as child care remains a major hurdle for many working parents, few companies are taking advantage of a federal tax break given to firms that provide child care for their employees, according to IRS data. But the just-signed tax and budget bill includes a little-known provision that more than triples the Employer-Provided Childcare Tax Credit, and data shows that child care benefits are helping companies’ bottom lines. Les Wexner Five years ago, Ohio’s most revered entrepreneur Les Wexner stepped down as chairman of L Brands and soon began to sell off his stake in the Victoria’s Secret parent company amid controversy over his close relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Many believed that Wexner, then age 82, would quietly retire. Instead, the fashion mogul has more than doubled his fortune thanks in large part to some savvy bets in a different industry: technology. Over just the past three months, his net worth—which includes assets held in his children’s and wife Abigail’s names—has soared to $10.1 billion from $7.9 billion, according to Forbes’ estimates. The biggest driver of this increase: a 4% stake in CoreWeave, one of the buzziest artificial intelligence companies. On Monday, CoreWeave announced it is buying crypto miner Core Scientific in a roughly $9 billion all-stock deal. CoreWeave’s market capitalization has almost tripled since its March IPO to nearly $73 billion today, and Wexner’s stake is now worth $2.8 billion. The eight-year-old CoreWeave helps companies build data centers and loans out cloud access to much-sought-after graphics processing units, or GPUs, which firms like Microsoft, IBM and Meta pay to use to build AI models. With no shortage of customers, the company recorded $982 million in revenue during the first quarter of this year, a 420% increase versus the same quarter last year. However, it’s yet to turn a profit and reported a net loss of $315 million during the same period. WHY IT MATTERS “After originally making a fortune in fashion, Wexner has become one of the biggest (and most unlikely) winners of the AI gold rush,” says Forbes staff writer Jemima McEvoy. “In addition to becoming an early backer of the $73 billion (market cap) CoreWeave, one of the buzziest AI companies around, Wexner's real estate development firm has played a crucial role in bringing big tech players like Meta, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Intel to Central Ohio.” MORE How Victoria’s Secret Billionaire Owner Accidentally Scored A $800 Million Stake In An AI Unicorn Millions of borrowers will soon be on the hook for thousands of extra dollars as the Trump Administration is slated to start charging interest next month on student loans under the Biden-era SAVE plan. Borrowers enrolled in the plan have had their loans in forbearance since last summer while it’s been held up in court: About 7.84 million: The number of borrowers with loans under the SAVE plan that will be affected by the change $3,500: The amount in additional interest per year that the average borrower enrolled in the SAVE plan will be charged, which works out to about $300 per month 1.5 million: How many applicants for income-driven repayment plans were yet to be processed, the Education Department said in a June court filing Many employees have experienced “quiet firing,” where a manager makes a work environment so unpleasant that it pushes people to quit. Sometimes quiet firing occurs because a boss isn’t doing their job, or it could just be part of the company culture—it’s an easier way for firms to reduce headcount without very public layoffs. If you’ve been silently pushed out, try not to take it personally: You deserve a workplace that supports your growth.

Title: Nvidia breaks market value record of $4 trillion

The silicon valley chip maker briefly topped a record-breaking $4 trillion valuation. Nvidia has seen a consistent rise over the past two years, as enthusiasm for AI-powered tech continues. Shortly after the US stock market opened on Wednesday morning, Nvidia's stock price surged to $164.42. This pushed it briefly to a valuation of $4 trillion, a market value greater than the GDP of France, the UK, or India. The success at the Californian chip company has been helping the wider stock market recover after a downturn in April, partly prompted by US President Donald Trump announcing widespread tariffs. Trump's ongoing trade war sent global markets plummeting. Nvidia, led by Taiwan-born Jensen Huang, has seen a consistent rise over the past two years as this enthusiasm over AI has boomed. Many big tech companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta, have also joined the multi-billion dollar AI race. "The market has an incredible certainty that AI is the future," Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers told AFP news agency. "Nvidia is certainly the company most positioned to benefit from that gold rush." In early 2025, Nvidia and generative AI such as OpenAI were challenged by the arrival of China-based DeepSeek. DeepSeek disrupted the AI world with a low-cost, high-performance model. Nvidia lost some $600 billion in market valuation in a single trading session at that time. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video After Trump's tariffs hit the tech sector hard in April, Nvidia quickly bounced back. In the most recent quarter, Nvidia reported earnings of nearly $19 billion despite a $4.5 billion hit from US government export controls which limit chip sales to China. In May, the company reached a deal to build AI infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, during a Trump state visit. "We've seen the administration using Nvidia chips as a bargaining chip," said Angelo Zino, technology analyst at CFRA Research. Even as Trump has announced new tariffs in recent days, US stocks have remained high, with the tech-centered Nasdaq closing at a new record on Wednesday. Shares in Nvidia closed on Wednesday with a market value of $3.972 trillion. Edited by: Elizabeth Schumacher

(Reuters: Robert Galbraith) Nvidia has become the first publicly traded company to surpass a $US4 trillion ($6.12 trillion) market valuation. The milestone highlights what has been widely viewed as the biggest tectonic shift in technology since the introduction of the first iPhone 18 years ago. AI bellwether Nvidia is now worth $US900 billion more than Apple. Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia has become the first publicly traded company to surpass a $US4 trillion ($6.12 trillion) market valuation. It puts the latest exclamation point on the investor frenzy surrounding an artificial intelligence boom powered by its industry-leading processors. Although Nvidia's market value dipped back below $US4 trillion by the time the stock market closed, the milestone marked what is being widely viewed as the biggest tectonic shift in technology since Apple co-founder Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone 18 years ago. Underscoring the changing of the guard, AI bellwether Nvidia is now worth $US900 billion more than Apple, which rode the iPhone's success to become the first publicly traded company to be valued at $US1 trillion, $US2 trillion and eventually, $US3 trillion. Technology multinational Nvidia has become the world's most valuable company, dethroning tech heavyweight Microsoft as its high-end processors play a central role in a scramble to dominate artificial intelligence computing. Nvidia's rise comes as Apple has struggled to deliver on its ambitions to infuse the iPhone and other products with more AI. In the meantime, former Apple design guru Jony Ive has joined OpenAI to work on a wearable AI device that could challenge the iPhone, while Nvidia has been scrambling to meet the feverish demand for its specialised chips. And tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms are upping the AI ante too, collectively budgeting about $US325 billion for investments in the technology this year, with a significant amount of that money likely to flow into Nvidia's coffers. The ravenous appetite for Nvidia's chips are the main reason the company's stock price have increased 10-fold since early 2023, catapulting its market value from about $US400 billion to $US4 trillion. After exceeding $US4 trillion for the first time early on Wednesday, Nvidia's shares backtracked below that threshold at their closing price of $US162.88. But most analysts do not expect the price to stay below $US163 for long. In a sign of the pervasive optimism surrounding Nvidia, CFRA analyst Angelo Zino on Wednesday issued a research note predicting the stock would climb to $US196 within the next year to push the company's market value to $US4.8 trillion. Jensen Huang's widening fame has been accompanied by a fattening fortune. (AP: Sarah Meyssonnier) Nvidia's rapid rise also has anointed the company's founder and CEO Jensen Huang as "the godfather" of AI, with his dissertations about the technology's direction attracting enraptured audiences. Mr Huang's widening fame also has been accompanied by a fattening fortune, now estimated at $US142 billion. It looked like Nvidia might have hit a road block in early April when US President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs and triggered a widespread sell-off on the stock market that hit the tech sector especially hard. At its nadir, Nvidia's stock price slipped below $US87. But Nvidia quickly bounced and in late May delivered another stellar quarter, highlighted by a $US18.8 billion profit, despite a $US4.5 billion hit to account for US government restrictions on the sale of some of its chips to China.

Title: Delete WhatsApp and Install Signal

Time Published: 2025-07-09T22:15:56Z

Andrew Steele WhatsApp is the world's most popular instant messaging service, and it's owned by Meta—the same company behind Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. If you value your privacy and digital security, I strongly recommend removing all of these apps from your phone. If there are any you absolutely can't live without, at minimum revoke every permission you can to protect yourself from the serious privacy and security risks these apps pose. The best alternative to WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger is Signal, which offers genuinely private and secure messaging. Signal encrypts all your messages and metadata, meaning Signal itself knows almost nothing about you. Crucially, it's run by a nonprofit organisation, not a corporation whose entire business model depends on harvesting your personal data to sell targeted advertising. For Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, you're far safer accessing them through your web browser rather than installing their apps. Even if most of your contacts use WhatsApp, you can make a difference by encouraging the people you contact the most to move to Signal. If most of your messages are on Signal—and then likely the most sensitive ones too—you can start to take back your privacy. And secondly, if we all start to do this, it will mean more people are on Signal, hopefully gradually making it more attractive to move across! If you don't read any further, this is the short version: Delete Meta's apps, use Signal for messaging, and access social media through your browser instead. While WhatsApp claims* your message contents are end-to-end encrypted, Meta extensively collects the 'metadata' around your conversations. This includes who you message, when you message them, how often you communicate, and your location data. WhatsApp's privacy policy states that the app collects extensive usage logs, including the time, frequency, and duration of your activities. This metadata collection creates a detailed profile of your most private relationships and activities. If you message your therapist, doctor, lawyer, or visit sensitive locations like medical clinics, Meta instantly knows something deeply personal about you—information that could be legally or personally compromising. Even worse, they scan your entire contact list to build social networks of people who may not even use Meta's services, creating detailed profiles of individuals who never consented to this data collection. * Because WhatsApp is ‘closed-source’, we can’t examine the code to check their claims. However, given that you can report messages to Meta for violating the terms of use, they clearly do have mechanisms to read messages. Signal, on the other hand, is ‘open-source’, meaning that anyone can read the source code, and independent experts have verified that it’s private and secure. Meta's track record on privacy is…not great. Here are some of their most egregious violations: Meta allowed Cambridge Analytica to harvest data from up to 87 million Facebook users without their consent, which was then used to manipulate political campaigns. The company was fined $5 billion by the FTC for this breach—yet their stock price actually went up after the fine was announced, showing how little these penalties actually deter such behaviour. Between September 2024 and early June 2025, Meta's Android apps (Facebook and Instagram) covertly tracked users' web browsing, even in incognito mode, or if using a VPN. Meta used this method without obtaining consent from users, linking browsing history to Facebook and Instagram profiles. This tracking was so invasive that even Google called it abusive. The fact that Meta was willing to engage in such underhanded data collection means that simply having one of their apps on your phone poses a serious privacy and security risk. Facebook used phone numbers that users provided for security purposes (like two-factor authentication) for advertising targeting—a direct violation of user trust and their stated privacy policies. And, just a few weeks ago, WhatsApp started asking users to add their email address ‘for extra security’. Uh-huh… Meta now requires you to manually opt out of having your WhatsApp conversations fed to their AI in every single chat you participate in. This feature was rolled out with virtually no fanfare—I discovered this 'feature' by accident, meaning my private conversations had probably already been processed by Meta's AI systems. While Meta claims this is only for local AI features like enhanced search (eg, if you type ‘find me that time Andrew complained about how terrible WhatsApp is for privacy’ into the search bar, and it will dig out that bit of chat), the reality is that training data for AI models is one of the most valuable commodities in tech today. Given Meta’s track record of privacy violations, can you trust them not to use your intimate conversations in their ongoing AI development? The Facebook app now includes a setting asking users to upload every photo on their camera roll to Meta's AI for 'cloud processing' and unspecified 'suggestions'. Think about what's in your photo library: that picture of a rash you took to show the doctor, pictures of your whole family on the beach in swimwear, that snap you took of your passport in case you lose it, screenshots of personal information… Do you really want Meta having access to every image you've ever captured on your phone? And can you be sure that Meta won’t roll out a ‘feature’ like this to their other apps in future? Again, images are a hugely valuably commodity for AI training these days—the incentive is definitely there for Meta to hoover them all up. Meta makes plenty of money from WhatsApp both by using the data it gathers to serve ads on its other platforms and by business accounts paying for certain features. But apparently this isn’t enough, and there are ads directly in WhatsApp now. This is just in the ‘stories’ tab for now—which honestly I don’t use very much—but it really wouldn’t come as a surprise to get a ‘helpful’ suggestion for a pizza place next time I’m telling someone that I’m hungry in a WhatsApp chat…or maybe an ad for a therapist next time I mention I’m not feeling great? When advertising is the primary business model, privacy inevitably takes second place. The safest approach is to completely uninstall all Meta apps from your phone. If you absolutely must keep some for work or social reasons, you can try to limit the risk by doing the following: However, given Meta's willingness to exploit Android vulnerabilities for covert tracking, having any of their apps installed remains a privacy risk. I wish I could delete WhatsApp entirely, but it requires a critical mass of people to make the switch before Signal becomes the default messaging platform. That's where you come in. Try Signal today, and convince your friends and family to join you. It's one of the simplest and most effective actions you can take to protect not just your own privacy, but to help create a more secure digital world for everyone. The choice is clear: continue letting Meta profit from your most intimate communications, or take control of your digital privacy. What will you choose? Your email address will not be published.

Title: Who Should Avoid the Nasdaq QQQ ETF? Risks and Drawbacks Explained

Time Published: 2025-07-09T21:17:37Z

The Nasdaq QQQ ETF is often praised for its outstanding performance, particularly during technology-driven bull markets. Backed by the Nasdaq-100 index, QQQ gives investors exposure to some of the most innovative and fastest-growing companies in the world, like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon. But while it’s a fan favorite for growth-seeking investors, the Nasdaq QQQ ETF isn’t a one-size-fits-all investment. Lets break down who should avoid the Nasdaq QQQ ETF, explore its potential risks and limitations, and explain why it’s not suitable for every portfolio. Whether you’re a new investor, a conservative saver, or a retiree managing withdrawals, this guide will help you decide if QQQ belongs in your investment strategy. Contents The Invesco QQQ Trust (ticker: QQQ) is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index. This index includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. It’s heavily weighted in technology, but also includes sectors like consumer discretionary, communication services, and healthcare. The fund is widely regarded as a strong option for long-term growth investors. But like any investment, it comes with trade-offs. Before diving into why you might want to avoid it, let’s touch on why many investors love QQQ: But these strengths can quickly turn into weaknesses if they don’t align with your risk tolerance or investment goals. Let’s break down the types of investors who might want to steer clear of QQQ, and the reasons why. The Nasdaq QQQ ETF is built for aggressive growth, not stability. It often experiences sharper declines during market downturns due to its high exposure to tech and other volatile sectors. If you’re looking for a safe, low-volatility investment for peace of mind, QQQ likely isn’t the best fit. Investors who are in or approaching retirement usually prioritize capital preservation and income over growth. QQQ’s volatility and low dividend yield make it less suitable for this stage of life. If you’re withdrawing funds regularly, a more conservative, income-focused ETF or bond allocation may be more appropriate. If you follow a value investing strategy—buying undervalued stocks with strong fundamentals—then QQQ likely doesn’t align with your approach. Value investors often prefer funds that track the Russell 1000 Value Index or individual stocks with low valuations. QQQ is highly concentrated in technology and a few mega-cap stocks. If you’re looking for balanced exposure across sectors, QQQ might not give you what you need. If true diversification is your goal, consider a total market ETF like VTI or a multi-sector portfolio. While QQQ has delivered incredible long-term returns, it can be extremely volatile in the short term. Many traders get in expecting fast profits and panic sell during corrections. If you’re not prepared for the ups and downs, or you’re new to investing, QQQ might lead to losses instead of gains. Aside from being a poor fit for certain investors, there are inherent risks with investing in QQQ. Understanding these helps you make better decisions. QQQ is heavily weighted in a small number of mega-cap tech stocks. If a few of these companies underperform, the entire ETF suffers. With tech dominating the fund, sector-specific downturns (like tech crashes or regulatory crackdowns) can disproportionately hurt performance. QQQ isn’t ideal for income investors. The yield is much lower than broader market ETFs or dividend-focused funds. High-growth tech stocks generally underperform in rising interest rate environments. This makes QQQ vulnerable when rates are hiked. Some of QQQ’s top holdings have high valuation multiples. If earnings fail to meet expectations, prices can fall hard. If QQQ doesn’t align with your goals or risk tolerance, here are some alternatives: Despite the drawbacks, QQQ can still be a great investment for the right investor: The key is understanding the risks and making sure they align with your strategy. The Nasdaq QQQ ETF is powerful, but it isn’t perfect. It shines in bull markets and tech rallies, but stumbles during periods of volatility or interest rate hikes. It can be an excellent tool for wealth building—but only if it fits your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. If you’re nearing retirement, seeking income, or prioritizing sector diversification, QQQ may not be for you. Instead, look toward more balanced, conservative ETFs that better match your objectives. Bottom Line: Know your financial goals, understand your risk appetite, and choose investments that align with both. QQQ is not inherently bad it’s just not for everyone.

WSB Now SAN FRANCISCO — (AP) — Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia on Wednesday became the first publicly traded company to surpass a $4 trillion market valuation, putting the latest exclamation point on the investor frenzy surrounding an artificial intelligence boom powered by its industry-leading processors. Although Nvidia's market value dipped back below $4 trillion by the time the stock market closed, reaching the milestone highlighted the upheaval being unleashed by an AI craze that's widely viewed as the biggest tectonic shift in technology since Apple co—founder Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone 18 years ago. Underscoring the changing of the guard, AI bellwether Nvidia is now worth $900 billion more than Apple, which rode the iPhone's success to become the first publicly traded company to valued at $1 trillion, $2 trillion and eventually, $3 trillion.

In the meantime, former Apple design guru Jony Ive has joined forces with OpenAI to work on a wearable AI device that could challenge the iPhone while Nvidia has been scrambling to meet the feverish demand for its specialized chips that power the energy-intensive data centers underlying artificial intelligence. And tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms are upping the AI ante too, collectively budgeting about $325 billion for investments in the technology this year — with a significant amount of that money likely to flow into Nvidia's coffers. The ravenous appetite for Nvidia's chips are the main reason that the company's stock price increased by 10-fold since early 2023, catapulting its market value from about $400 billion to $4 trillion. After exceeding $4 trillion for the first time early Wednesday, Nvidia's shares backtracked below that threshold at their closing price of $162.88. But most analysts don't expect the price to stay below $163 for long. In a sign of the pervasive optimism surrounding Nvidia, CFRA analyst Angelo Zino on Wednesday issued a research note predicting the stock will climb to $196 within the next year to push the company's market value to $4.8 trillion. Nvidia's rapid rise also has anointed the company's founder and CEO Jensen Huang as “the godfather” of AI, whose dissertations about the technology's direction attract enraptured audiences.

Title: Nvidia beats Microsoft and Apple to $4 trillion market cap

Some of you may remember that Nvidia posted a very strong quarter in its Q1 FY2026 results. The company raked in $44.1 billion in revenue, which was a 69% increase from the same quarter last year and a 12% bump over the previous quarter. Nvidia has forecasted an even stronger quarter in Q2 FY2026, with revenue figures expected to be at the $45 billion mark. However, ahead of that actually happening, the firm has hit a pretty major milestone. Nvidia has become the first company in the world to achieve a market capitalization of $4 trillion after the company's stock price rose by over 2% today, as noted by CNBC. The company has surpassed both Apple and Microsoft in reaching this milestone, which is a major feat considering that both companies hit the $3 trillion market cap ahead of Nvidia. Microsoft is currently valued at $3.7 trillion, Apple is at $3.1 trillion, Alphabet (Google's parent company) is sitting comfortably at $2.1 trillion, and Meta is holding strong at $1.8 trillion. Nvidia's market cap has been boosted by strong demand for its specialized and general purpose hardware during this age of generative AI. The chipmaker really hit its stride after the meteoric growth in popularity of ChatGPT in late 2022. In addition, many companies - like Microsoft - which offer public cloud platforms to their customers rely on Nvidia's hardware for various workloads. That said, Nvidia has faced its fair share of challenges too. A recent U.S. government restriction requires it to utilize new licenses to export H20 products to China, which is expected to cost the firm $8 billion in lost sales. Notably, the $45 billion revenue estimate that Nvidia shared for the current quarter already accounts for this loss, which means that its revenue would have been above $50 billion otherwise. It will be interesting to see if other tech firms are able to catch up to Nvidia or if the chipmaker will continue sailing out of reach.

Business A NVIDIA logo is pictured on its facility at the High-tech park at Yokne'am, in northern Israel Jul 9, 2025. (Photo: REUTERS/Shir Torem) NEW YORK: The stunning rise of Nvidia to become the first publicly traded company valued at US$4 trillion underscores the massive importance to the stock market of the AI chipmaker and the technology sector. Reaching the lofty milestone caps a massive run for Nvidia's stock price, which has soared some 1,350 per cent since October 2022. This year, the chipmaker's shares are up about 22 per cent against a 6 per cent rise for the S&P 500. The company's market value hit US$4 trillion in morning trading on Wednesday (Jul 9), about 13 months after it had first reached the US$3 trillion milestone. Nvidia's stock surge has given it significant weight in key equity indexes and ETFs that are more heavily influenced by companies with the biggest market values.

Title: How Much Is $4 Trillion? Here Are Some Ways To Think About Nvidia's Market Cap Milestone

Nvidia (NVDA) briefly surpassed a record market capitalization of $4 trillion on Wednesday morning, an amount of money that could buy you pretty much anything. The tech titan's market value is comparable to some of the largest economies in the world, as a $4 trillion gross domestic product is roughly what was produced in 2024 by Japan and India, per the World Bank, trailing only the U.S., China, and Germany. Here's a rundown of some measures of what the artificial intelligence chipmaking giant is now worth. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has become the richest person in the world thanks to his stake in Tesla, where he was an early investor, along with other companies he has helped start or acquire, like SpaceX, The Boring Company, Neuralink, and X. As part of that wealth exists in the form of shares in Tesla, the billionaire's net worth can vary on a daily basis as the electric vehicle company's stock price moves. The Forbes billionaires list on Wednesday puts Musk's net worth just shy of $400 billion, still at least $100 billion more than Oracle (ORCL) co-founder Larry Ellison, Meta Platforms (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, or Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, but only about 10% of Nvidia's current value. Based on the current market caps of the just over 500 stocks that make up the landmark index (to account for companies like Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) with multiple share classes, Nvidia's current value could buy nearly half of the index. Starting from the least valuable with Enphase Energy (ENPH) at about $5.5 billion and working up, Nvidia's $4 trillion market cap is worth as much as the bottom 216 companies in the S&P 500, according to Investopedia's calculations. That group includes such household names as General Mills (GIS), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Domino's Pizza (DPZ), and Best Buy (BBY). In its annual ranking of the most valuable sports franchises in the world, Forbes last December estimated that the top 50 teams globally across the NFL, MLB, NBA, and professional soccer were worth a combined $289 billion. That means that at Nvidia's current market cap, it could acquire the 50 most valuable and popular sports teams including the Dallas Cowboys, New York Yankees, and Real Madrid nearly 14 times. In its most recent valuation after the 2023 season, Forbes pegged the value of all 10 teams on the current Formula One racing grid at about $19 billion, meaning Nvidia could afford to buy the racing series more than 200 times. In March 2024, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that the company's then-recently announced Blackwell chip, designed for the heavy workloads of running and training AI models, would cost between $30,000 and $40,000 each, estimating that about $10 billion of R&D costs went into the chip. That means Nvidia's market cap could buy between 100 million and 133 million of its own chips. For comparison, Elon Musk's xAI startup, which makes the Grok chatbot that is used on the social media site X, has installed about 200,000 chips from Nvidia to train and run the product.

Title: The 15 best deals from Walmart's big Prime Day rival sale

Time Published: 2025-07-09T18:47:58Z

Prime Day is ending tonight, but you can rest easy knowing there are still plenty of deals to shop in the days after Amazon's event wraps up. Walmart is running a massive competing sale until Sunday, and we've gathered the best Walmart deals rivaling those of Prime Day, below. Some of the best Walmart deals this year are on tech products, with prices matching many Amazon Prime Day discounts. Apple is particularly strong, with $120 off the new iPad Air and a 30% discount on the Apple Watch Series 10 42mm. But if you're looking to beat Amazon prices, home and kitchen is the way to go. The 21-piece beige Carote nonstick cookware set is just $100 at Walmart, while an incredibly similar cream white set is just over $123 for Prime Day. Deals are going fast, too. At $100 off, the Blackstone ProSeries 2-burner is sold out for shipping and delivery (although you can always try finding one for pickup at a nearby store). While the sale lasts through July 13, we recommend buying sooner rather than later if you see something you're interested in, since items often go out of stock. You can explore more sales in our best Prime Day deals hub and our guide to the best Prime Day competing sales. Apple is a popular category this year from Walmart, with iPads, AirPods, Apple Watches, and more down to all-time lows. These prices are just as low as Amazon's during Prime Day, making now a good time to buy. The new M3 iPad Air models include an upgraded processor and added video editing features over last year's models. Otherwise, they offer the same design and features as their predecessors in the same 11-inch and 13-inch form factors. The AirPods Pro 2 are a big upgrade from their predecessors, with improved noise cancellation and battery life. They also support new aural health features to assess your hearing and function as hearing aids. This model comes with a USB-C charging case and added dust resistance. The 11th-generation iPad largely mirrors the 10th-generation iPad from 2022, apart from its upgraded A16 chip and increased storage. It lacks Apple Intelligence, but it's the cheapest option in the brand's lineup and more than enough for most users. The MacBook Air released in late 2020 with Apple's M1 processor brings impressively fast performance and long battery life for $649, making it among the best Apple laptops overall considering its price. The 44mm Apple Watch SE is simply a larger model than the 40mm SE, and is otherwise identical. The Apple Watch SE is the perfect blend of features and affordability. The Apple Watch Series 10 is thinner than its predecessors, with larger display sizes and cases (including a new titanium option). It runs on the latest S10 processor and has a wide-angle OLED display for easier reading at an angle, faster charging, and media playback from its speakers. Apple's handy tracking device comes bundled in a discounted four-pack. Airtags are easy to set up and allow you to track multiple items in the Find My app alongside your friends and devices. The Apple Pencil (USB-C) is compatible with any iPad that has a USB-C port. These days, that's any iPad Apple sells today. It charges via USB-C, but it can still attach magnetically to your iPad. It's a little more basic than the 2nd-gen Apple Pencil, but it does support Apple's Hover feature for the iPad Pros. When it comes to tech, Walmart loves to compete with Amazon's low Prime Day pricing by matching deals for TVs, gaming, and more. These deals are as good, if not better, than what Prime members can score this week. The Linkbuds Fit are good earbuds for various workouts, but we found their design to be especially good for bike riding since they don't stick out and mess with helmet straps. The Beats Studio Pro are wireless headphones designed to do it all, whether you want to be fully immersed in an album or take a call on the go. They offer both active noise canceling (ANC) and transparency modes, making them a versatile option for any situation. This Roku Smart TV lets you stream all of your favorite apps with 4K resolution and an enhanced voice remote. The 50-inch Vizio MQX is a budget-friendly QLED built with gaming in mind. It has a higher refresh rate than most competing sets this size, which can offer smoother gameplay when paired with a PS5, Xbox Series X, or PC. The Quest 3S is Meta's most affordable VR headset. It has the same chipset and gaming performance as the pricier Quest 3, but its display isn't as sharp. This is an excellent fit for casual users who want a more budget-friendly entry into the world of VR. This is a great time to buy, as you'll get a free download of the Batman: Arkham Shadow game and three months of Meta Quest+ (combined $70 value). Coffee makers, vacuum cleaners, and other home goods are popular products to find on sale during Prime Day, so Walmart is meeting the heat by dropping prices just as low as Amazon. Brands like Bissell, Dyson, Keurig, and KitchenAid are all available now. Carpet and upholstery cleaners can often be large, bulky contraptions that clutter busy closet floor space. So, the portable Bissell Little Green cleaner is a great option for small spaces like apartments, tiny houses, and condos because it's small enough to fit in cupboards, on shelves, or potentially even under your sink. Coffee is a serious necessity for some, and the AeroPress is small, simple, portable, and easy-to-use way to brew a highly competitive, frothy cup of coffee somewhere between a French press and an espresso. This mixer packs a punch with a large stainless steel bowl meant for mixing big batches of heavier foods. It comes with 11 mixing speeds and is compatible with multiple attachments. Whether you're looking for a frying pan, a large pot, or something to stir and flip with, Carote's massive selection of nonstick cookware can help build out a kitchen. This Keurig takes the signature brewer to a new level with app compatibility so you can customize and schedule your brew. Plus, you can choose from five strength settings and six temperature settings. This corded electric Dyson is self-righting and comes with four other tools in addition to the Turbinehead to get maximum coverage on different surfaces. The Dyson V12 Detect Slim Cordless Stick Vacuum is a lightweight cleaning solution that balances battery run time and suction. The chair comes with three accent pillows and rotates on a 360-degree swivel base. This traditional kit comes with 20 treatments of whitening strips, with the goal of getting teeth 18 levels whiter within 20 days. The Sonic-Fusion combines an electric toothbrush and a Waterpik to score double the power of traditional brushing and flossing on getting rid of plaque and keeping gums healthy. This device is accepted by the American Dental Association. With the Schick Intuition Sensitive Care razor, there's no need for a separate can of shaving gel because it's built right into the razor cartridge. The AncestryDNA + Traits kit gives you all of the same information as you get from the above kit plus over 25 of your most interesting traits as determined by your genetics so you can learn about where your characteristics came from. Walmart Plus is an entire membership program designed to benefit regular shoppers at Walmart. It gets you free delivery on groceries from your local store with no minimum spend, fuel discounts, and other promo offers throughout the year. In an answer to Amazon's Prime Video bonus, you also get a free Paramount+ subscription packed with TV and movie content. While Walmart Plus subscribers got early access to Walmart's deals this week, you don't need to be a member to shop the sale now. Unlike Prime Day, the sales are for anyone and don't require any form of membership. Walmart Plus subscriptions offer more than just shopping perks. Like Amazon Prime, memberships unlock an impressive suite of benefits, including access to Paramount Plus Essential, free online pet care through Pawp, Burger King savings opportunities, and more. Most notably, memberships come with free shipping (no order minimum) and free delivery ($35 minimum) from your local store. You can learn more on the Walmart Plus membership page. The grand Walmart or Amazon debate is totally dependent on you and your needs. You can learn more about the two services and their respective perks in our Amazon Prime vs. Walmart Plus guide, where we note that while the memberships offer different value, Prime Day deals tend to be a bit better when it comes to variety and value.

Fortune Intelligence uses generative AI to help with an initial draft, thereby bringing you breaking business news faster while maintaining our high standards of accuracy and quality. These stories are edited by Fortune's senior business editors to verify the accuracy of the information before publishing. Nvidia made history by becoming the world’s first publicly traded company to surpass a $4 trillion market capitalization. The milestone was reached as Nvidia’s stock price surged to $164.42 during intraday trading on July 9. The company’s stock has soared by approximately 1,460% over the past five years, with a near 18% gain registered year-to-date. Nvidia’s ascent is driven by its near-monopoly on AI chip manufacturing, with its graphics processing units (GPUs) forming the backbone of machine learning, data centers, and large language models. The Silicon Valley giant’s chips are now essential for tech giants including Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet. Nvidia’s historic rally has had a dramatic impact on the personal fortune of its co-founder and CEO, Jensen Huang. As of July 2025, Huang’s net worth is estimated by Bloomberg at $140 billion, up $25 billion this year alone. Huang owns about 3.5% of Nvidia, making him the largest individual shareholder. This surge places Huang among the world’s 10 richest individuals, with his fortune closely tracking Nvidia’s stock performance. Nvidia now holds the heaviest weighting on the S&P 500 index, surpassing tech giants Apple and Microsoft. The milestone has fueled optimism for further growth, with some analysts projecting Nvidia’s market cap to keep rising. Loop Capital’s Ananda Baruah sees Nvidia at the “front-end” of the next “Golden Wave” for generative AI pushing it past $6 trillion in coming years.

Title: Why Coca-Cola’s CIO prioritizes big-impact AI pilot projects
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/07/09/why-coca-colas-cio-prioritizes-big-impact-ai-pilot-projects/
Time Published: 2025-07-09T15:15:32Z

John Kell is a contributing writer for Fortune and author of Fortune’s CIO Intelligence newsletter. Neeraj Tolmare, the chief information officer at Coca-Cola, says the artificial intelligence pilots that he invests in only get authorized if the beverage giant can envision revenue generation or big efficiency gains once fully in production. This strategy reflects a mandate from Coke’s CEO James Quincey and the broader leadership team that demands that AI experimentation “has to be tied to a real outcome that moves the needle for us,” says Tolmare. “We are all about scale.” That scale is massive for Coca-Cola, which is ranked 97th on the Fortune 500. Each AI bet by Tolmare has to weigh cost of implementation, as well as how the technology may be used internally across various functions ranging from software development to sales. On top of that, he must weigh how new technology advancements like agentic AI will change workflows and how data is shared within Coke and close key external partners, including the 200 bottlers and 950 production facilities that make up the entire system that Coke relies on to serve 2.2 billion beverages each day. One pilot that Tolmare is particularly excited about is the development of an algorithm that Coke developed to help retail outlets better predict demand, using AI to ensure that their shelves are always appropriately stocked. In the past, sales agents would visit stores every few weeks and at times, find themselves facing half-empty coolers. Coke had to rely on historical retail scan data to try to anticipate future demand. But with AI, the company was able to create an algorithm that triangulates historical data with weather patterns, which is an important consideration for beverage purchases, and geolocation data from Google to more precisely predict future sales. Those AI insights inform the messages Coca-Cola sends via WhatsApp to managers, advising them on when to stock more Sprite or Diet Coke before they run out. The pilot was tested in three countries and saw sales increase by 7% to 8% versus outlets that weren’t using the AI algorithm, according to Tolmare, who intends to broaden the application of this AI tool to more markets globally. Another investment with big reach is Coke’s usage of AI for content creation. The beverage giant sells in more than 180 countries and creates marketing assets in over 130 languages. It’s a process that’s both time consuming and costly, because Coke has to adjust the materials to reflect not only language, but also cultural sensibilities. Coke recently created 20 AI-generated assets, all based on the company’s own proprietary intellectual property, and then created 10,000 variations to be used across many different languages and geographies. Tolmare asserts that consumers are 20% more likely to engage with this content than prior iterations that weren’t crafted by AI, and that the AI-produced content was three times faster to generate. In both cases, he stresses the importance of keeping humans in the loop. “AI has proven that it can unlock value that a human being would not be able to unlock because the computation needed to mine through all this data and bring something meaningful is so complex,” says Tolmare, in regards to the algorithm to support retail sales. With marketing, AI’s application is a bit trickier and Coke is still figuring out the right approach. An AI-generated Christmas spot generated some backlash last year and in April, a different campaign made a mistake featuring a quote from a book that novelist J.G. Ballard never wrote. Tolmare says Coke has strict guidelines in place to ensure that AI-generated content avoids social biases that would be harmful to consumers and is keenly aware of hallucinations or deepfakes that can occur when generating creative content with AI tools. “That’s not to say that we won’t ever fall into it,” admits Tolmare. “But we have a mechanism in place that allows us to react in a responsible way if and when that happens.” Most of Tolmare’s career has been in the technology industry, including working for gadget manufacturer Palm, which ultimately lost out on an effort to compete with Apple in the smartphone market. He also previously served as a director at networking-equipment company Cisco Systems and as a VP at HP during the years in which it split up the personal-computer and printer businesses from the corporate hardware and services arm. “I’ve spent more than two decades working for companies that develop and manufacture technology that the rest of the world uses,” says Tolmare. He joined Coca-Cola in 2018 to work at a company that consumes technology, rather than developing it, to grow their business. Tolmare spearheaded the company’s all-in bet on cloud computing, retiring or selling all of Coke’s physical data centers. Roughly 80% of the company’s footprint is in Microsoft Azure with the rest split between Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud. “We continuously monitor which one is going to give us better efficiency by moving a workload from one cloud to another,” says Tolmare. His hybrid cloud playbook is also applicable to how Coke thinks about generative AI experimentation. Coke works closely with Microsoft and its strategic partner OpenAI, but also taps other AI hyperscalers including Google, Meta, and Anthropic. “We don’t want to paint ourselves into a corner too soon,” he says. “The market itself is not consolidating.” What’s next on deck is further exploration with agentic AI, systems that are designed to perform tasks autonomously or with little human intervention. The company is considering offerings from vendors including Microsoft, SAP, and Adobe, while developing its own AI agents trained on Coke’s data. All of these AI agents remain in the pilot phase, because Tolmare still wants to determine if these systems can be built at a cost effective price, while achieving the optimal business outcomes. “We haven’t launched agentic in production yet, but we are very close,” says Tolmare. “I’m fascinated by what this can do for our business.” John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. Tech giants offer more discounts to the federal government. The Wall Street Journal reports that Oracle is cutting the cost of the company’s database software and cloud-computing service for the federal government. The discount on cloud infrastructure is the first of its kind for the entire government and could be replicated with other cloud providers in negotiations that are currently underway. Other recent price discounts that the General Services Administration were able to extract from vendors include a deal cut with Salesforce to trim the price of messaging app Slack by 90% through the end of November and lower costs from Google and Adobe. The GSA has opted to negotiate these savings through direct engagement with the tech giants, rather than discussing pricing with third parties. “Through procurement consolidation, we’re aiming to bring the leverage of the whole, commanding purchasing power of the federal wallet to these [technology providers] to get the best discounts for the taxpayers,” Federal Acquisition Service Commissioner Josh Gruenbaum told WSJ. Ford CEO predicts AI will replace half of U.S. white-collar workers. CEOs have increasingly shared their dour prognostication of AI’s impact on the future of work and the latest diagnosis came from Jim Farley, the CEO of automaker Ford. Speaking at the Aspen Ideas Festival, Farley was making the case that the education system is too focused on pushing students toward a four-year college degree, which may be counterintuitive, given his view that “AI is gonna replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.” Farley makes a pitch for more investment in trade workers, those who may take a job on an auto factory floor or in construction, where there is a shortage of workers. He may have a point, as tech giants continue to slice jobs, with Microsoft earlier this month cutting another 9,000 jobs, bringing the grand total of jobs eliminated by the tech giant to 15,000 this year. But, IT unemployment dropped to its lowest level this year in June. Much of the consternation about AI's impact on work has been focused on tech jobs, especially as big employers like Microsoft and TikTok continue to generate national headlines when announcing layoffs. That said, across all sectors, businesses are on the hunt for talent and have been hiring for software developers and engineers, systems engineers and architects, and cybersecurity professionals, according to CIO Dive, which reported on insights from CompTIA. The IT trade organization reported that IT unemployment fell to 2.8% in June, as companies across all sectors added 90,000 net new tech jobs. Active employer job listings for tech positions reached 455,341 in June, with 47% of that total newly added in June. But the tech industry itself continues to be a weak point, as that sector reduced staffing by a net 7,256 positions in June. Google parent company’s AI-powered drug firm gearing up for clinical trials. Alphabet’s drug discovery arm, Isomorphic Labs, is getting close to testing AI-designed drugs in humans, Fortune reports, as company president Colin Murdoch says “the next big milestone is actually going to clinical trials, starting to put these things into human beings. We’re staffing up now. We’re getting very close.” Isomorphic Labs, which was spun out of Google’s AI research lab DeepMind in 2021, raised $600 million in April to help propel its goal of combining the expertise of machine learning researchers and pharma veterans to design new treatments at a faster pace, more cheaply, and with a higher rate of success. Isomorphic supports existing pharma drug discovery programs, having already inked research collaborations with Novartis and Eli Lilly, and also develops its own internal drug candidates in areas such as oncology and immunology. Why CIOs need to focus on both data quality and permission. A new survey found that while 52% of companies are “highly reliant” on the consented data that’s used to craft personalized marketing materials and product development, there are still roadblocks as it pertains to how enterprises use this data. That’s important to get right if enterprises want to retain trust with the consumers that authorize the use of their data, while also adhering to state laws in places like California, which has given individuals greater control over their personal information. Some big issues that CIOs face related to consent requirements include a lack of visibility into data flows (61%), followed closely by difficulty tracking user preferences across channels (59%). They’ll need to solve these problems quickly as 100% of the 265 survey respondents say that consented consumer data is foundational to their ability to succeed when it comes to pursuing AI initiatives. Kate Parker, President of Transcend, the data privacy management software provider that funded the study, tells Fortune that the findings highlight a shift in thinking that’s less focused on data quality and more about permission to use the consumer data in the first place. “If CIOs and digital leaders are in agreement that the consent of the data is the fundamental component of AI and personalization, but they also admit very openly that they do not have the infrastructure to solve that in scale, that’s going to be one of the biggest growth blockers,” says Parker.

And the most valuable company ever. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Nvidia on Wednesday became the world's first company to reach a market capitalization of $4 trillion, making it the world's most valuable company ever. The company's stock price is driven by the AI frenzy as well as its unique position in the AI ecosystem as the key supplier of hardware and software stack for training and inference. By reaching the $4 trillion market capitalization, Nvidia not only left behind such tech giants as Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Meta (Facebook), and Microsoft, but also the vast majority of semiconductor companies. Only Broadcom ($1.298 trillion) and TSMC ($1.2 trillion) are in the Top 10 of the world's most valuable companies and are among the three semiconductor firms to reach a trillion-dollar capitalization mark. Other semiconductor companies, such as ASML ($313.22 billion), AMD ($226.76 billion), Texas Instruments ($197.61 billion), Arm Holdings ($161.3 billion), and Qualcomm ($175.67 billion) are far from touching a $1 trillion market capitalization. Intel, once an investors' darling, is now valued at $101.26 billion. Such a huge difference between the market capitalization of Nvidia and its industry peers underscores the unique position that Nvidia holds in today's high-tech ecosystem. The company supplies AI GPUs to virtually all of the AI leaders, including Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, OpenAI, and xAI, just to name a few. So far, only Microsoft Azure has warned that it would slow down the expansion of its data centers. Other companies are well on track to expand their AI clusters to hundreds of thousands or even millions of Nvidia GPUs in the coming years, so the sky is blue for Nvidia. Observers believe that investors' optimism about Nvidia stems from three factors. Firstly, they expect the AI sector to continue growing in the coming years, which will ensure growing sales of AI hardware. Secondly, Nvidia is expected to sustain its leading position on the market as so far, no company has unveiled hardware that can match the performance and scalability of Nvidia's GPUs for AI training and inference. Thirdly, investors now expect the U.S. to reach trade deals with the most important partners, which will ensure the company's ability to supply its products to growing markets, including the Middle East and Europe, which will offset the company's current inability to supply high-performance AI GPUs to China.

Title: Ambani's Reliance Jio delays India IPO beyond this year: Report
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/ambanis-reliance-jio-delays-india-ipo-beyond-this-year-report-11752071301806.html
Time Published: 2025-07-09T14:36:35Z
Full Content:
NEW DELHI/SYDNEY (Reuters) -Indian telecoms and digital giant Reliance Jio Platforms, led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has decided not to launch its planned IPO this year, delaying one of the country's most anticipated stock offerings, two people familiar with the matter said. Valued by analysts at more than $100 billion, Jio wants to achieve higher revenue and a bigger subscriber base for its telecoms business while expanding its other digital offerings to boost its valuation before an initial public offering, one of the sources said. Shares of parent conglomerate Reliance Industries fell sharply in Mumbai after the Reuters report, losing as much as 1.8%, or $6 billion in market value. Reliance closed 1.2% down, with its significant weighting in other indexes dragging the broader Indian market into negative territory. Nearly 80% of Jio Platforms' latest annual revenue of $17.6 billion came from its telecoms business -- Reliance Jio Infocomm, India's biggest player. But Ambani is also accelerating expansion of his other niche digital businesses focused on developing apps, connected devices and AI business solutions. Reliance Jio is also set to lock horns with Elon Musk, who is expected to launch the Starlink internet service in India in the coming months. Jio, which counts Google and Meta among investors, has also partnered Nvidia to develop AI infrastructure. Ambani said in 2019 that Jio and Reliance Retail will move towards listings within five years. And last year Reuters reported that Reliance was targeting a 2025 Mumbai listing for Jio Platforms, aiming for it to be India's biggest IPO. "Jio (IPO) is not going to happen this year, it's just not possible. The company wants the business to be more mature," the first source said. Both the sources, who declined to be identified because the strategy is confidential, said Reliance had yet to appoint bankers to discuss a potential stock market offering. Reliance did not respond to Reuters queries on the matter. Jio Infocomm has faced some churn in its subscriber base after price increases but has returned to growth this year and has more than 488 million subscribers. Indian brokerage IIFL Capital said in April that it was cutting its 2025-26 core profit estimate for Jio by 3%, citing higher costs and the expected increase in prices, probably in late 2025. It also cut its valuation estimate from $117 billion to $111 billion, though Jefferies values the business at $136 billion. The first source declined to share the valuation that Jio had been targeting for the proposed IPO but said it was "easily above $100 billion". India's IPO market had its best year in 2024, with $20.5 billion raised, second only to the United States. Trade wars and Middle East tension have turned market sentiment jittery, but it is recovering. India is the world's second-biggest IPO market with $5.86 billion raised by June this year, accounting for the 12% of total proceeds globally, LSEG data shows. Reuters has previously reported that the Reliance Retail IPO was being delayed for the company to address operational challenges at the company that runs India's biggest grocery store network of 3,000 supermarkets. The Reliance Retail IPO is unlikely before 2027 or 2028, the first source added without elaborating. Reliance Retail and Jio have powered the parent's earnings in the six months to March while its energy segment has been hit by lower margins and weaker demand. Ambani, Asia's richest man, has raised $25 billion collectively for digital, telecoms and retail businesses from the likes of KKR, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, General Atlantic and Silver Lake in recent years. "The investors are not upset (about IPO delays). They know the money is sitting in front of them," the first source said.

Title: NVIDIA’s AI Chips Are “The New Gold And Oil,” Says Investment Bank As Firm Briefly Crosses $4 Trillion Market Value

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. AI GPU designer NVIDIA Corporation made history today by becoming the first company in history to cross a $4 trillion market capitalization before slightly dipping below it. NVIDIA's achievement follows a surge in its shares in June after a massive crash in January that saw the firm bleed $600 billion in market capitalization after investors fed the shares, worrying that China's DeepSeek had demonstrated cost-effective GPU use that could cull the demand for NVIDIA's GPUs. June was a strong month for NVIDIA's shares as they benefited from bullish analyst estimates for medium-term AI demand. NVIDIA continues to enjoy a dominant role in the AI ecosystem courtesy of its GPUs, which lead the market in terms of performance and are among the most highly sought products in the world. The criticality of NVIIDA's GPUs was evident in a fresh note from Wedbush, which came just as the firm crossed the $4 trillion market capitalization milestone. Calling NVIDIA's AI chips "the new gold and oil," the investment bank posits that $4 trillion is just the start and investor attention will focus on $5 trillion over the next 18 months. Wedbush adds that NVIDIA might not be the only $4 trillion company, as it might be joined by software giant Microsoft. NVIDIA's shares have stayed resilient despite US sanctions on China, which have hurt the firm's revenue. The robust performance is partly due to CEO Jensen Huang pivoting to sovereign AI after the Chinese restrictions to assure investors that NVIDIA can sell its chips to other countries as well. Like NVIDIA, Microsoft's shares were also laggards at the year's start. The stock had struggled since mid-2024 after investors were left wondering whether the software company could adequately monetize its AI cloud computing offerings. However, Microsoft's latest earnings report shifted the narrative, as 33% Azure growth during its fiscal third quarter ended up allaying investor concerns. "We believe Microsoft will also hit the $4 trillion market cap club this summer and then over the next 18 months the focus will be on the $5 trillion club," said Wedbush as it believes that the AI-led stock market growth is still in its nascent stages. Going all-in on AI, the investment bank shares that "it represents the biggest tech transformation in over 40 years" and adds "that for every $1 spent on Nvidia, there is an $8-$10 multiplier across the rest of the tech ecosystem." While Wedbush's note focuses primarily on enterprise AI, the bank briefly mentions that Alphabet, Amazon and Meta are its favorite players in consumer AI. Notably missing is Apple, whose 13% year-to-date share price drop is partly due to investor belief that the firm has fallen behind big tech when it comes to AI. The bank concludes its note by sharing that it is seeing "many IT departments focused on foundational hyper scale deployments for AI around Microsoft, Amazon, and Google with a laser focused on the software driven use cases currently underway as high priority AI use cases have been identified and now being driven/accelerated across a myriad of verticals."

Title: See the billionaires and CEOs at the Sun Valley 'summer camp for billionaires' this year

For tech and media moguls, Sun Valley is the place to be this week. The annual Allen & Co. Sun Valley Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, is hallowed ground where billionaires and CEOs rub shoulders and strike deals. Allen & Co., the organizer of the off-the-record event, is a boutique investment firm. Over the years the summit has hosted the likes of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Spotify CEO Daniel Ek. Sun Valley has also played a part in major deals over the years, such as Disney's acquisition of ABC and Comcast's takeover of NBCUniversal. The summit kicked off Tuesday and is set to go through the weekend. Here's a look at who's attending this year: OpenAI chief Sam Altman arrived in Sun Valley wearing a simple navy blue T-shirt and chunky white sunglasses from Vuarnet. The glasses, inspired by 1970s ski masks, retail for $410, according to the brand's website. Altman's entry into Sun Valley comes shortly after he said last month that Meta was "crazy" for trying to poach top AI talent from OpenAI with $100 million signing bonuses. He was also joined at the conference by OpenAI's chief operating officer, Brad Lightcap. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet — Google's parent company, wore an all-blue outfit on the first day of the conference, with a button-down, indigo jeans, and dark sunglasses. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, arrived in Sun Valley in his signature simple style, wearing a navy polo, square-rim black glasses, and a fitness tracker on his wrist. He had a bag slung over his shoulder and waved to the cameras. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek stuck to founder-core fashion at Sun Valley in a black zip-up hoodie, a matching polo underneath, and dark denim. He carried a notebook. Former Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg arrived in Sun Valley hand in hand with her husband, Tom Bernthal, the former CEO of consulting agency Kelton Global. The pair was dressed for comfort — Sandberg wore a cropped black cardigan with a black top under, paired with light-wash blue jeans, while Bernthal wore a collared cream sweater and gray slacks. Sandberg stepped down from Meta in 2022. She is the founder of LeanIn.Org, a nonprofit organization for women. Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy came to Sun Valley in a printed T-shirt with a blue button-down thrown over, paired with black sunglasses. The Sun Valley retreat comes shortly after Jassy said AI will eliminate some jobs at Amazon, but create some roles in AI and robotics. On the first day of the conference, Bob Iger, Disney's CEO, wore a white polo shirt and black-tinted sunglasses to complete the look. Rivian's CEO, RJ Scaringe, arrived at Sun Valley on day one sporting a navy Thalia Surf baseball cap, a Rivian logo tee, and a smart fitness tracker. He recently talked to BI about the impact President Donald Trump's new Big, Beautiful Bill would have on Rivian, an EV company. Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, wore a navy polo with contrast piping, an SV25-branded cap, and sleek frameless glasses for the occasion. Nadella recently said that the hardest challenge with AI was not building or deploying it, but rather getting employees to change the way they work. Yahoo CEO Jim Lanzone opted for a laid-back style at Sun Valley — dressed in a navy crewneck tee, gray utility pants, and black sunglasses hanging from his collar. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi wore athleisure at Sun Valley: a fitted blue T-shirt, a navy SV-branded cap, and dark shades hanging from his collar. He had a sweatshirt tied around his waist and a cup of coffee in his hand. The CEO recently weighed in on an important question many Uber users have: when customers should tip. "Tipping is entirely optional," Khosrowshahi said in a June interview on CBS Sunday Morning. "But if you feel like you got a good ride, if the service quality was terrific, then you can tip through the app." General Motors' CEO, Mary Barra, arrived in Sun Valley wearing a crisp white blouse with flared cuffs, paired with beige trousers. She accessorized the outfit with a quilted black Dior tote, a black portfolio, and a pair of black sunglasses, which she carried in her hand. Netflix's co-CEO Ted Sarandos kept it simple at Sun Valley, flashing a relaxed wave in a charcoal polo shirt. Sarandos recently spoke out about how AI won't replace humans in storytelling but could help creators make movies on much smaller budgets. Netflix's finance chief, Spencer Neumann, strode into the conference dressed in a black polo and relaxed-fit jeans, with a brown outerwear in hand and holding a carry-on. Bobby Kotick, the former CEO of video gaming company Activision Blizzard, stepped into Sun Valley sporting a crisp white polo, gray trousers, and aviator shades tucked at the collar. The ex-CEO last year expressed interest in buying TikTok, which faces a divest-or-ban deadline in the US. PayPal chairman and former Nike CEO John Donahoe kept things classic on the first day of the conference in a navy polo, dark-wash denim jeans, and sunglasses clipped at the chest. Donahoe stepped down as Nike's CEO last year and was replaced by longtime Nike veteran Elliott Hill. News Corp.'s CEO, Robert Thomson, leaned into mountain casual at Sun Valley in a classic plaid flannel layers over a black T-shirt, light-wash jeans, and brown belt. Thomson, 64, wore a black baseball cap and accessorized with red wristbands and silver jewelry. Spotify's co-president, Alex Norström, stepped out in a textured gray jacket over a crisp white T-shirt. He accessorized with chunky black sunglasses and reading glasses draped around his collar. Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner kept it cozy on the first day of the conference, donning a soft blue sweater layered over a striped button-down. He also wore a thin leather necklace with a ring around his neck. Eisner, 83, paired the look with round-frame sunglasses and a bright blue baseball cap. He stepped down as Disney's CEO 20 years ago. Environmental Defense Fund's president, Fred Krupp, kept it sharp and understated in a pale blue button-down and dark slacks. He was pictures holding a dark navy blazer and a black zip portfolio. Jared Kushner dressed in minimalist fashion at Sun Valley in a fitted black button-down, a black T-shirt underneath, paired with dark sunglasses. He was pictured walking alongside Warner Bros. Discovery's CEO, David Zaslav, who wore a pale gray cargo jacket with a blue shirt underneath, white pants, and aviator-style glasses. Last month, Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders a 4% pay raise proposal for Zaslav, as the company battles declining sales and a falling stock price. LinkedIn's cofounder, Reid Hoffman, arrived in Sun Valley in a dark jacket, thrown over a blue shirt. He was pictured alongside Yahoo's cofounder, Jerry Yang. Hoffman recently said that Gen Z graduates are "enormously attractive" hires to employers because of their familiarity with AI. Brian Armstrong, the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, wore a minimalist outfit to Sun Valley: a plain, tight-fitting black tee, a navy cap, and a matching jacket tucked under one arm. Bill McDermott, CEO of software company ServiceNow, waved to photojournalists as he arrived in Sun Valley in a black utility jacket, beige collared shirt, and red-tinted shades. CBS Mornings co-host Gayle King arrived in Sun Valley in radiant summer whites, wearing a sleeveless blouse and layered pearl necklaces. She accessorized with chunky white bangles, cat-eye glasses, and held a bright yellow phone in her hand. The couple showed up in black and white patterned tops. President Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, are also in attendance at Sun Valley. They were each photographed walking alongside Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav. YouTube CEO Neal Mohan wore a dark gray jacket over his lighter gray shirt, and black sunglasses to round out the look. Sony CEO Hiroki Totoki had a navy crossbody bag and jacket tied around his shoulders. Fashion designer Bendet Eisner, who is the founder and CEO of Alice + Olivia, wore a colorful matching set and accessorized her handbag with several charms — including a Labubu. Witz and her husband left lunch with a copy of Barry Diller's book, "Who Knew." Lütke and his wife, Fiona McKean, wore denim as they walked to a morning session at the conference. McKean wore a top from Finnish design house Marimekko. Kent layered a colorful outfit while his wife, Monica Meacci, stuck with an all-white look. Hastings was seen talking with Philippe Laffont, founder of Coatue Management, pictured at left here. Netflix's co-CEO, Ted Sarandos, was also in attendance at the conference. Silver was seen carrying notes and a laptop as he walked around the conference grounds. Former Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers took a phone call between sessions. Duolingo cofounder Luis von Ahn sported a casual look at the conference. Robert Thomson, CEO of News Corp., the media conglomerate founded by Rupert Murdoch, wore jeans and plaid over a graphic tee. He accessorized with bracelets and a black News Corp hat. Jump to

ByJosipa Majic Predin ByJosipa Majic Predin, Contributor. SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 06: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks during the OpenAI DevDay event ... More on November 06, 2023 in San Francisco, California. Altman delivered the keynote address at the first-ever Open AI DevDay conference. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The artificial intelligence industry just witnessed one of the most dramatic market distortions in Silicon Valley history. When former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati’s six-month-old startup Thinking Machines Lab successfully raised 2 billion dollars at a 10 billion dollar valuation, it crystallized a fundamental shift in how AI companies compete for talent. But this astronomical funding round isn’t just about one company’s ambitions - it's the direct result of a compensation arms race that began with Meta's desperate hundred-million-dollar recruiting spree. The pattern is unmistakable: Ilya Sutskever’s Safe Superintelligence raised 1 billion dollars at a five billion dollar valuation with no publicly released product. Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab secured 2 billion dollars at a 10 billion dollar valuation for a company that’s existed for just 6 months. These aren’t isolated incidents-they represent the new normal in AI investing, where talent portfolios command unicorn valuations before building anything tangible. The story begins with Meta’s aggressive talent acquisition strategy. According to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta began offering signing bonuses as high as 100 million dollars to poach top researchers from his company. Meta offered employees of rival OpenAI signing bonuses of 100 million dollars to switch companies, with even larger annual compensation packages. While later reports clarified that no one was really getting a hundred million dollar "signing bonus", the psychological impact on the market was immediate and profound. The timing of Meta’s recruitment blitz was strategic. As AI capabilities rapidly advanced and competition intensified, Mark Zuckerberg recognized that talent, not just capital, would determine market leadership. "The List" includes five ex-OpenAI employees as Meta looks to build reasoning models to contend with rivals, highlighting the systematic nature of this talent acquisition campaign. Meta’s compensation strategy created an unintended consequence that reverberated throughout Silicon Valley. When established companies couldn’t match these astronomical packages, they inadvertently set a new baseline for AI talent expectations. Every engineer who heard about hundred-million-dollar offers - even if they didn’t receive them - began to recalibrate their own market value. This is where Murati’s funding round becomes particularly significant. Thinking Machines Lab, the secretive AI startup founded by OpenAI’s former chief technology officer Mira Murati, has closed a 2 billion dollar seed round at a 10 billion dollar valuation. With this valuation, offering 1% equity to a senior engineer effectively provides the same hundred-million-dollar package that Meta was dangling, but with potentially unlimited upside. The mathematics are stark: in a market where top talent expects hundred-million-dollar packages, startups need billion-dollar valuations just to compete. This represents a fundamental shift from traditional equity-based compensation models where early employees accepted lower salaries in exchange for potentially valuable stock options. This phenomenon extends beyond Murati’s success. The venture capital ecosystem has fundamentally shifted its evaluation criteria for AI startups. Traditional metrics like revenue, user growth, and product-market fit have been replaced by team pedigree, publication records, and previous company affiliations. Ilya Sutskever’s Safe Superintelligence exemplifies this trend, raising 1 billion dollars at a 5 billion dollar valuation with no publicly released product or service. The mathematics behind these investments reflect a new understanding of value creation in AI. When a single breakthrough algorithm can generate tens of billions in market value, investors are essentially purchasing lottery tickets with extraordinarily high potential payoffs. The team becomes the product, and their collective expertise represents the company's entire value proposition. The current landscape reveals clear winners and losers in this talent war. Established tech giants like Meta, Google, and Microsoft can absorb massive compensation costs as operating expenses. Well-funded AI startups with venture capital backing can inflate their valuations to offer competitive equity packages. However, mid-sized companies and traditional enterprises find themselves increasingly priced out of the AI talent market. The pattern is consistent across multiple high-profile cases. Companies like Safe Superintelligence and Thinking Machines Lab represent a new category of “talent unicorns” - startups valued primarily on their human capital rather than their technological assets. This shift forces traditional businesses to compete not just on product features or market positioning, but on their ability to attract and retain the small pool of elite AI researchers who command these premium valuations. The AI talent market now operates under fundamentally different rules than the broader tech industry. While traditional software companies might offer senior engineers packages worth two hundred thousand to five hundred thousand dollars annually, AI companies routinely offer multimillion-dollar packages for similar roles. This disparity creates several strategic challenges for companies across the ecosystem. First, it forces non-AI companies to either dramatically increase compensation or risk losing technical talent to AI-focused competitors. Second, it creates internal equity issues when AI engineers command significantly higher compensation than equally skilled colleagues in other domains. The talent war has also accelerated the trend toward specialized AI roles. Companies are no longer just hiring "software engineers" but specifically recruiting "AI researchers," "ML engineers," and "AI safety specialists" at premium rates. This specialization further fragments the talent pool and drives up costs. Beyond individual companies, this compensation inflation has broader economic implications. It concentrates high-skilled talent in a narrow set of companies and geographic regions, potentially limiting innovation in other sectors. The astronomical valuations required to compete for AI talent also create potential bubble conditions, where companies are valued based on their ability to attract talent rather than their actual business prospects. The phenomenon also raises questions about resource allocation efficiency. When companies spend billions primarily to secure talent rather than develop products, it suggests that the current market structure may be creating significant inefficiencies. OpenAI CTO Mira Murati has reportedly doubled the amount of funding she's seeking to raise for her startup Thinking Machines Lab, indicating that even initial funding targets proved insufficient to compete effectively. The current talent war raises fundamental questions about long-term sustainability. While venture capital markets can support inflated valuations in the short term, companies ultimately need to deliver returns that justify these investments. The pressure to monetize AI capabilities quickly may lead to rushed product launches or over-promising on technological capabilities. Some industry observers argue that the current compensation levels are unsustainable and will eventually correct. However, the unique nature of AI talent—where individual contributors can have outsized impact on company success—suggests that premium compensation may persist longer than in other technology sectors. The international dimension adds another layer of complexity. While US companies engage in bidding wars for AI talent, international competitors may gain advantages by accessing talent pools with different compensation expectations. This could potentially shift the geographic center of AI innovation over time. The AI talent war represents more than just competitive hiring-it reflects the industry's belief that artificial intelligence will fundamentally reshape the global economy. Companies are essentially placing multi-billion-dollar bets on their ability to attract and retain the individuals who will build these transformative technologies. Meta's hundred-million-dollar signing bonuses were intended to solve a specific recruitment problem. Instead, they created a market distortion that forced every other AI company to compete at similar levels. Mira Murati's two-billion-dollar funding round at a ten-billion-dollar valuation represents the logical conclusion of this arms race: when talent becomes the primary constraint on growth, companies will pay whatever it takes to secure it. The question now is whether this new paradigm will drive breakthrough innovations that justify the enormous investments, or whether it represents a misallocation of resources that will eventually require correction. Either way, the AI talent war has permanently altered the landscape of Silicon Valley compensation, creating new rules that extend far beyond the artificial intelligence industry itself. For now, one thing is certain: in the battle for AI supremacy, reputable AI talent has become the ultimate currency, and the price of that currency continues to climb.

Wednesday, 09 Jul 2025 NEW YORK, July 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks ended mixed on Tuesday, as investors weighed escalating trade threats from U.S. President Donald Trump against bullish revisions to Wall Street's outlook for the rest of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 165.60 points, or 0.37 percent, to 44,240.76. The S&P 500 sank 4.46 points, or 0.07 percent, to 6,225.52. The Nasdaq Composite Index increased by 5.95 points, or 0.03 percent, to 20,418.46. Six of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in red, with consumer staples and utilities leading the laggards by losing 1.09 percent and 1.07 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, energy and materials led the gainers by rising 2.72 percent and 0.53 percent, respectively. Trump reiterated his Aug. 1 deadline for finalizing trade deals, writing in a Truth Social post that "no extensions will be granted." At a Cabinet meeting later in the day, he announced a 50-percent tariff on copper imports, sending copper prices surging 13 percent to a record high. He also floated potential tariffs as high as 200 percent on pharmaceuticals and said he might notify the European Union within two days of new penalties if a deal is not reached. Trump's aggressive tone came on the heels of letters sent Monday to 14 mostly Asian countries outlining duties scheduled to take effect next month. Despite the tough rhetoric, market reaction was relatively muted. "If people believed it, we'd be down several percentage points," said market analyst Tom Essaye. "The fact that we're not means nobody believes it." He noted that while sentiment was extremely bearish in the spring, the market has become vulnerable to negative surprises now that indexes are hovering near all-time highs. In contrast to trade concerns, two major investment banks boosted their year-end S&P 500 targets. Bank of America raised its target to 6,300, citing solid corporate earnings and resilient consumer spending. Goldman Sachs lifted its forecast to 6,600 from 6,100, although chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin warned that the recent tech-driven rally has narrowed market breadth to its lowest level since 2023. In equity moves, major technology shares were mixed. Tesla rose 1.32 percent as the stock rebounded from Monday's drop following news that Tesla CEO Elon Musk launched a new political party. Meta Platforms and Apple inched higher, while Microsoft and Broadcom edged slightly lower. Amazon declined more than 1 percent despite kicking off its Prime Day sales event, and Alphabet also slipped about 1 percent. Nvidia was up 1.11 percent after it got a price target bump from Citi on 'Sovereign AI' demand surge. Market attention is turning to Wednesday's release of the Federal Open Market Committee minutes from the Federal Reserve's June meeting. "This last policy meeting probably was a bit more contentious than the prior meeting in May," said Bob Lang, chief options analyst at Explosive Options. "There probably was a lot of discussion about when the next rate cut is going to be, so that's going to be important to help move markets along." Thank you for your report!
