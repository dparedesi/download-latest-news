This week: Bitcoin miners wrangle with malaise, Coinbase tries a little misdirection ahead of its earnings miss, and sources say Meta is stablecoin curious. Bitcoin miners’ malaise Publicly traded Bitcoin miners have faced some dark days this week. Stocking up on BTC wasn’t enough to help MARA Holdings, which trades on the Nasdaq under the MARA ticker, outrun a lousy quarterly report on Thursday. Remember that at the end of March 31, when Bitcoin was trading for around $83,000, the company announced a $2 billion stock offering to raise cash for “general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin and for working capital.” And the company has been no stranger to acquiring Bitcoin on the open market. Whatever gains the company might realize on BTC purchases with its latest offering will be fodder for Q2 earnings. The company posted a $533 million Q1 loss yesterday, largely due to having to adjust the valuation of Bitcoin that’s on its balance sheet. But here’s the really troubling detail: Mining output fell 19% even though the Florida company has now doubled its capacity since the 2024 Bitcoin network’s halving. A quick refresher: The Bitcoin network has now undergone four halving events, which reduce the reward paid to Bitcoin miners by half. Last year’s event saw the reward drop to 3.125 BTC. But that doesn’t mean investors are racing for the doors. MARA opened Friday trading for $15.16, 6% higher than yesterday’s close. And while MARA bought Bitcoin in Q1, its rival Riot Platforms outsold all other publicly traded miners by unloading 475 Bitcoin in April, worth $38.8 million at the time. Time to moth ball the mining rigs? Nah, not all of them, according to investment bank Benchmark. On Tuesday, the bank’s analysts set a 5x price target of $3 and buy rating for Canaan, which trades on Nasdaq under the CAN ticker. Equity research analyst Mark Palmer is betting that Canaan’s North American expansion will help its stock rise. But a few hours before the closing bell Friday, it was down 5.87% for the week and trading for $0.75. Deja Vu for Meta There might be a new company in the Public Keys cohort soon. Meta, which trades on the Nasdaq under the META ticker, doesn’t want to say anything about it on the record, but five unnamed sources told Fortune that the Facebook parent company is exploring the idea of using stablecoins to reward content creators on its platforms. One of the crypto execs who spoke with the magazine posited that Meta subsidiary Instagram could use stablecoins to pay lower fees on small payments of $100 or less to content creators. Execs who spilled the deets to Fortune were careful to say the company is very much in the exploratory phase and that implementation could be a ways off. If this sounds familiar, it’s because the company tried to roll out its own stablecoin, Diem, in 2019. But it got a slap on the wrist from regulators and abandoned the project in 2022 by selling the assets to now-defunct crypto-friendly bank Silvergate. But shareholders might want to see Meta drop one of its lagging experiments before it picks up a new one. Analysts have been calling for the company to abandon its Reality Labs project, which is responsible for the Quest VR headset, augmented reality sunglasses, and the Horizon Worlds metaverse game. Forrester analyst Mike Proulx has called Reality Labs a “leaky bucket” after the company’s Q1 earnings report revealed the division had lost $4.2 billion in Q1, bringing its cumulative losses to $60 billion. Coinbase misses on revenue—look over there! Maybe it’s just us, but splashy announcements ahead of earnings usually mean there’s been less than stellar performance for the quarter. At least, that was the case for Coinbase this week. On Wednesday, the company released the spoils of its FOIA request to get public records from the SEC, FDIC and other agencies on their investigations into Ethereum and efforts to debank crypto firms. Then, on Thursday, the company started the day touting its nearly $3 billion acquisition of crypto derivatives exchange Deribit. But the company's after market earnings report showed that it saw a big slowdown in retail trading volume. It’s not entirely surprising. Global markets have been at the mercy of fractious trade negotiations—or lack thereof—for months. CEO Brian Armstrong said he still wants to see USDC become the largest U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin within a couple years. It’s not just for bragging rights, either. USDC is still a huge money maker for Coinbase. The exchange’s deal with Circle, which evenly splits interest earned on the cash backing USDC tokens, is “indefinitely renewable,” CEO Brian Armstrong said on the company’s earnings call Thursday. “Increased USDC balances on our platform result in durable revenue for Coinbase. Base stablecoin balances reached $4 billion in Q1, up 12% quarter-over-quarter. This was also largely driven by USDC,” he added.

Title: Bitcoin beats Amazon to become the world’s 5th most valuable asset

Surpassing Amazon was just the beginning – what does Bitcoin’s $2 trillion leap tell us about the market’s next move? Bitcoin [BTC] has broken through the $100K threshold once again, reaching a remarkable $104K after weeks of downward pressure. According to the latest data from CoinMarketCap, BTC was trading at $103,234.98 at press time, posting a 3.67% daily gain and an impressive 33.63% surge over the past month. But perhaps the most striking development is Bitcoin’s latest milestone, and that is, it has officially overtaken Amazon in market capitalization. As of the 9th of May, Bitcoin’s valuation soared to $2.045 trillion, narrowly edging past Amazon’s $2.039 trillion cap. While Amazon stock continues to climb, trading at $192.08 with a 1.79% gain, Bitcoin’s ascent signals more than just a price rally. With this move, it has also surpassed the market caps of silver, Google’s parent company Alphabet, and Meta, positioning itself as the world’s fifth-largest asset by market capitalization, according to CompanyMarketCap. Remarking on the same, Sina G., co-founder and COO of 21st Capital, noted, “Bitcoin just surpassed Amazon to become the 5th largest asset in the world. – No CEO – No headquarters – No marketing team Just code, conviction, and global demand. Next stop: NVIDIA.” Source: Sina/X Once considered a fringe investment, Bitcoin now stands shoulder to shoulder with traditional financial powerhouses, signaling its evolution into a mainstream store of value. That being said, this isn’t the first time Bitcoin has challenged Big Tech’s dominance. Back in April 2025, it briefly overtook both Amazon and Google with a $1.86 trillion valuation, reaching $94,000 per coin amid easing U.S.–China trade tensions and a tech-led market rally. However, the latest surge beyond $100,000 appears far more resilient, with Bitcoin surpassing its previous peak and firmly asserting itself among the world’s most valuable assets, especially after briefly hitting $109,000 during President Trump’s re-inauguration in January 2025. Needless to say, Bitcoin’s explosive rally hasn’t just shaken up trader sentiment; it’s sparked broader conversations among corporate giants. In fact, with nearly $1 billion in liquidations and over 190,000 traders caught off guard, the market is experiencing its most significant short squeeze since 2021, as per CoinGlass’ recent analysis. Source: CoinGlass Therefore, as BTC continues to assert itself as a dominant financial asset, even traditional players are starting to take notice. Notably, back in December 2024, Amazon faced pressure from the National Center for Public Policy Research to consider adopting a Bitcoin treasury strategy. The proposal urges the tech giant to allocate part of its $88 billion in reserves to BTC, underscoring how the cryptocurrency’s ascent is beginning to influence boardroom decisions and long-term corporate finance strategies.

Title: DeepSeek: Everything you need to know about the AI chatbot app | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us DeepSeek has gone viral. Chinese AI lab DeepSeek broke into the mainstream consciousness this week after its chatbot app rose to the top of the Apple App Store charts (and Google Play, as well). DeepSeek’s AI models, which were trained using compute-efficient techniques, have led Wall Street analysts — and technologists — to question whether the U.S. can maintain its lead in the AI race and whether the demand for AI chips will sustain. But where did DeepSeek come from, and how did it rise to international fame so quickly? DeepSeek is backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund that uses AI to inform its trading decisions. AI enthusiast Liang Wenfeng co-founded High-Flyer in 2015. Wenfeng, who reportedly began dabbling in trading while a student at Zhejiang University, launched High-Flyer Capital Management as a hedge fund in 2019 focused on developing and deploying AI algorithms. In 2023, High-Flyer started DeepSeek as a lab dedicated to researching AI tools separate from its financial business. With High-Flyer as one of its investors, the lab spun off into its own company, also called DeepSeek. From day one, DeepSeek built its own data center clusters for model training. But like other AI companies in China, DeepSeek has been affected by U.S. export bans on hardware. To train one of its more recent models, the company was forced to use Nvidia H800 chips, a less-powerful version of a chip, the H100, available to U.S. companies. DeepSeek’s technical team is said to skew young. The company reportedly aggressively recruits doctorate AI researchers from top Chinese universities. DeepSeek also hires people without any computer science background to help its tech better understand a wide range of subjects, per The New York Times. DeepSeek unveiled its first set of models — DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat — in November 2023. But it wasn’t until last spring, when the startup released its next-gen DeepSeek-V2 family of models, that the AI industry started to take notice. DeepSeek-V2, a general-purpose text- and image-analyzing system, performed well in various AI benchmarks — and was far cheaper to run than comparable models at the time. It forced DeepSeek’s domestic competition, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to cut the usage prices for some of their models, and make others completely free. DeepSeek-V3, launched in December 2024, only added to DeepSeek’s notoriety. According to DeepSeek’s internal benchmark testing, DeepSeek V3 outperforms both downloadable, openly available models like Meta’s Llama and “closed” models that can only be accessed through an API, like OpenAI’s GPT-4o. Equally impressive is DeepSeek’s R1 “reasoning” model. Released in January, DeepSeek claims R1 performs as well as OpenAI’s o1 model on key benchmarks. Being a reasoning model, R1 effectively fact-checks itself, which helps it to avoid some of the pitfalls that normally trip up models. Reasoning models take a little longer — usually seconds to minutes longer — to arrive at solutions compared to a typical non-reasoning model. The upside is that they tend to be more reliable in domains such as physics, science, and math. There is a downside to R1, DeepSeek V3, and DeepSeek’s other models, however. Being Chinese-developed AI, they’re subject to benchmarking by China’s internet regulator to ensure that its responses “embody core socialist values.” In DeepSeek’s chatbot app, for example, R1 won’t answer questions about Tiananmen Square or Taiwan’s autonomy. In March, DeepSeek surpassed 16.5 million visits. “[F]or March, DeepSeek is in second place, despite seeing traffic drop 25% from where it was in February, based on daily visits,” David Carr, editor at Similarweb, told TechCrunch. It still pales in comparison to ChatGPT, which surged past 500 million weekly active users in March. If DeepSeek has a business model, it’s not clear what that model is, exactly. The company prices its products and services well below market value — and gives others away for free. It’s also not taking investor money, despite a ton of VC interest. The way DeepSeek tells it, efficiency breakthroughs have enabled it to maintain extreme cost competitiveness. Some experts dispute the figures the company has supplied, however. Whatever the case may be, developers have taken to DeepSeek’s models, which aren’t open source as the phrase is commonly understood but are available under permissive licenses that allow for commercial use. According to Clem Delangue, the CEO of Hugging Face, one of the platforms hosting DeepSeek’s models, developers on Hugging Face have created over 500 “derivative” models of R1 that have racked up 2.5 million downloads combined. DeepSeek’s success against larger and more established rivals has been described as “upending AI” and “over-hyped.” The company’s success was at least in part responsible for causing Nvidia’s stock price to drop by 18% in January, and for eliciting a public response from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. In March, U.S. Commerce department bureaus told staffers that DeepSeek will be banned on their government devices, according to Reuters. Microsoft announced that DeepSeek is available on its Azure AI Foundry service, Microsoft’s platform that brings together AI services for enterprises under a single banner. When asked about DeepSeek’s impact on Meta’s AI spending during its first-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said spending on AI infrastructure will continue to be a “strategic advantage” for Meta. In March, OpenAI called DeepSeek “state-subsidized” and “state-controlled,” and recommends that the U.S. government consider banning models from DeepSeek. During Nvidia’s fourth-quarter earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang emphasized DeepSeek’s “excellent innovation,” saying that it and other “reasoning” models are great for Nvidia because they need so much more compute. At the same time, some companies are banning DeepSeek, and so are entire countries and governments, including South Korea. New York state also banned DeepSeek from being used on government devices. In May, Microsoft Vice Chairman and President Brad Smith said in a Senate hearing that Microsoft employees aren’t allowed to use DeepSeek due to data security and propaganda concerns. As for what DeepSeek’s future might hold, it’s not clear. Improved models are a given. But the U.S. government appears to be growing wary of what it perceives as harmful foreign influence. In March, The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. will likely ban DeepSeek on government devices. This story was originally published January 28, 2025, and will be updated regularly.

Title: Cargo thieves are attacking the U.S. supply chain at alarming rates

BREAKING: Trump is preparing to accept a superluxury jet from Qatar to use as Air Force One Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time America’s supply chain is under attack. From coast to coast, organized criminal groups are hitting trucks on the road, breaking into warehouses and pilfering expensive items from train cars, according to industry experts and law enforcement officials CNBC interviewed during a six-month investigation. It’s all part of a record surge in cargo theft in which criminal networks in the U.S. and abroad exploit technology intended to improve supply chain efficiency and use it to steal truckloads of valuable products. Armed with doctored invoices, the fraudsters impersonate the staff of legitimate companies in order to divert cargo into the hands of criminals. The widespread scheme is “low risk and a very high reward,” according to Keith Lewis, vice president of Verisk CargoNet, which tracks theft trends in the industry. “The return on investment is almost 100%,” he said. “And if there’s no risk of getting caught, why not do it better and do it faster?” In 2024, Verisk CargoNet recorded 3,798 incidents of cargo theft, representing a 26% increase over 2023. Total reported losses topped nearly $455 million, according to Verisk CargoNet, but industry experts told CNBC that number is likely lower than the true toll because many cases go unreported. Numerous experts who spoke to CNBC estimate losses are close to $1 billion or more a year. Train cargo thefts alone shot up about 40% in 2024, with more than 65,000 reported incidents, according to the Association of American Railroads. Industry experts and law enforcement officials say a more sophisticated and insidious form of cargo theft called strategic theft is also on the rise. The way the system is supposed to work is this: A shipper pays a broker, and the broker, after taking its fee, pays the carrier, the trucking company that moves the load. In strategic theft, criminals use deceptive tactics to trick shippers, brokers or carriers into handing cargo or legitimate payments, sometimes both, over to them instead of the legitimate companies. Strategic theft represented 8% of all cargo theft in 2020, according to Verisk CargoNet figures, but by the end of 2024, it had risen to represent about one-third. Tracking down the fraudsters, particularly if they are overseas, is almost an impossible task, Lewis said. “Think of identity theft,” Lewis said. “Think of a friend that’s had their identity stolen or their credit card stolen. There’s no difference ... There’s no bread crumb trail to follow. It’s a ghost.” Verisk CargoNet said it has tracked criminal groups that have tried to disrupt the U.S. supply chain to origins in 32 countries. “There’s no deterrent for these guys,” said Jerry Jacobs, who oversees risk management at Prosponsive Logistics in Atlanta. The company is a broker connecting shippers with the carriers that move their products. In an interview with CNBC, Jacobs said the criminals “literally have a license to steal.” “You’re hiding out in a foreign country, and all you need is a cell phone and a computer to conduct this type of fraud,” he said. “Every day, we’re seeing the bad guys trying to infiltrate our network. And our sales reps have to constantly stay vigilant,” Jacobs said. “I say this all the time to my sales folks, that there’s probably a 33% chance that you’re going to be talking to a bad guy that’s looking to steal freight.” Jacobs told CNBC during his interview in February that he was actively dealing with a fraud case. The offenders had stolen his company’s identity and were booking shipments, he said. Their goal was to convince a legitimate trucking company to pick up a shipment and unwittingly deliver it so that the criminals, rather than the real carriers, would get paid, he said. Jacobs showed CNBC the online platform used by brokers to book shipments, called DAT Freight and Analytics. There were listings purportedly initiated by his company, but they weren’t legitimate — they were booked, he said, by the criminals. “Right now, we’re dealing with a ton of calls about this,” Jacobs said at the time. “A lot of [carriers], unfortunately, picked up the shipment already for the bad guys, and they have already delivered it for the bad guys.” Weeks later, Jacobs was still dealing with the fallout. He said some of the loads were delivered, but not others, suggesting cargo and payments were stolen in the scheme. None of the carriers were paid, he said. Jacobs said crime costs the average consumer, too, as cargo theft fuels retail price increases. “I have to pay more at the grocery store, at the checkout line, because these bad guys want to come in and steal freight,” he said. Barry Conlon, founder and CEO of Overhaul, an in-transit supply chain security and risk management company based in Austin, Texas, said the crime groups are very familiar with how freight is moved across the U.S. “They have people who are literally pulling the information off websites, scraping it, in some cases,” Conlon told CNBC. “And then they’re attacking at a chosen location once they see the product they want. And it’s literally gone into the supply chain within days.” He contrasted the ease and payoff of cargo theft to the high risk and often lower reward of a bank robbery. “Rob a million-dollar load, that’s going to give you hundreds of thousands of dollars in return. And there’s literally no risk,” he said. Cargo theft, which is almost always nonviolent, is considered a property crime. According to industry experts, it’s underreported for a reason. “A lot of cases, they don’t report it because they feel they’re not going to get it back. It’s been weeks since they lost it and they’ve just found out about it,” Conlon said. Overhaul estimates there will be a 22% increase in incidents of cargo theft in 2025, according to the company’s most recent report on trends in the industry. Scott Cornell, the national transportation leader for insurance company Travelers Insurance, said he is also alarmed at what he’s seeing in the industry. ″[There are] two things that I always point out about the organized cargo theft rings that are committing these crimes,” Cornell said. “They know what to steal and when to steal it, and they’re really good at return on investment.” Food and beverage is the thieves’ No. 1 targeted commodity, according to Verisk CargoNet. “It’s consumable. So, the evidence disappears,” Cornell said. “It’s hard to chase. If you’re a cargo theft investigator and you’re trying to do a recovery investigation, the evidence is going be consumed, right? Or it’s going to spoil. There’s no barcode on a pistachio.” Household goods are the second-most commonly targeted cargo, followed by electronics, Verisk CargoNet found. Cargo loss isn’t something many retailers are eager to talk about. Meta, which was hit by a $500,000 theft of its Ray-Ban and Oculus glasses last year in Texas, declined to comment to CNBC. Nike, whose sneakers are favorites of cargo thieves, according to police and court records, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The problem is “noticeably increasing,” said Birger Buesching, head of the supply chain for Philips’ personal health consumer business, which includes Sonicare toothbrushes and Norelco shavers, among other products. “Two, three years ago, I didn’t have to worry about this,” Buesching told CNBC in February at the Manifest Conference in Las Vegas, where companies that focus on the supply chain showcased solutions to protect it. “But we do see an uptick in any kind of commercial shipments, bigger value shipments that are going out to our customers or traditional retail customers.” Replacing a stolen load is not so simple, he said. “First of all, we can’t ship that load on time and in full as we promise, so we’re letting our customers down,” Buesching said. “Often we have safety stock, so we can usually backfill orders very quickly, within days. But especially when you have custom-made products, then it might take a little longer, because you have to make more of that product.” Ellen Kapiloff, vice president of operations for North and Central America at Lacoste, said the threat of cargo theft can lead to inventory challenges on the floor. “If you’re a consumer and you wanted this shirt and we only made 100 of them and 50 of them were stolen, we are strategically going to place the other 50 in a different location, as well as a different channel,” Kapiloff told CNBC in an interview at the Manifest conference. “So, it might not be available to you at a store or online when you want it.” Coincidentally, in February, just 10 days after CNBC spoke with Kapiloff, California Highway Patrol’s Cargo Theft Interdiction Program served a search warrant at a store in Los Angeles’ fashion district. Officers found five boxes containing Lacoste slides footwear that law enforcement said was part of a large cargo heist. California sees more cargo theft than any other state in the U.S. In a separate case, in May 2024, athletic apparel retailer Lululemon reported a burglary at a distribution center in Ontario, California, in which thieves made off with “well over a million dollars’ worth of Lululemon product,” according to the California Highway Patrol. Police said a person was arrested on suspicion of selling the stolen goods. In a statement to CNBC, Lululemon said, “Retail crime, including cargo theft, is a serious industry-wide challenge, and we are taking decisive action to combat it. ... In this specific case, our collaborative investigation led to arrests and recovery of stolen products.” While there are financial impacts, cargo theft has been mentioned only sparingly in public companies’ earnings conference calls and investor webcasts over the last year. Knight-Swift is the industry’s largest full truckload carrier, but it has only spoken publicly about cargo theft once in the past year, according to a CNBC document search. CEO Adam Miller noted on the company’s October earnings call that it is “starting to hear a lot more comments around cargo security.” “I’ve gone to different conferences here over the last few months, and cargo theft is now a prevailing topic when it really wasn’t discussed that much in the past,” Miller said. On a January conference call for transportation company Landstar, Chief Financial Officer Jim Todd explained to investors that the increase in its insurance and claim costs in 2024 compared with 2023 was “primarily attributable to increased severity on cargo claims, primarily due to cargo theft and fraud in the supply chain.” Trucking company J.B. Hunt mentioned cargo theft more often over the past year than other publicly traded companies in the industry, though it was still light on details. In April 2024, the company’s president of highway services, Bradley Hicks, said technology has “opened new avenues for bad actors to engage in sophisticated strategic theft, giving these organized groups access to thousands of loads through our platform.” Hicks added J.B. Hunt is “making some adjustments to harden the security of our system.” Not everyone is raising alarms. C.H. Robinson has 450,000 contracted carriers and handles more than $23 billion in freight annually. The company’s success rate in deterring theft and fraud is “99.999%,” according to Michael Castagnetto, C.H. Robinson’s North American surface transportation president, who oversees cargo theft for the logistics company. “In January, for example, our North American trucking division recorded only two incidents. To put that in perspective: We move over 5 million truckload shipments a year,” Castagnetto told CNBC. Castagnetto said the company has strategies to weed out potential fraudsters, but, he added, “I can’t give you all the details, because we don’t want the bad actors to know how we catch them.” Cargo transportation companies of all sizes are working to address the rise in theft. Julia Fulton, director of corporate communications at TQL, the second-largest freight brokerage firm in the U.S., said the company has invested $4 million in technology and specialized personnel to combat the issue. Nolan Transportation Group said in a statement that protecting customers from cargo theft is a “top priority.” “We take a proactive, data-driven approach, focusing on early detection and prevention to ensure the security of shipments,” Katie Wild, vice president of marketing at Nolan, said in the statement. “We continuously strengthen our carrier onboarding process with additional security measures and increased real-time monitoring to proactively address fraudulent activities and identify suspicious behavior before it escalates.” DAT Freight and Analytics, the online platform widely used by brokers to book shipments, shows where freight is being moved around the country by a carrier and the broker that handled the transaction. Jeff Hopper, the chief marketing officer of DAT, said 90% of all fraud that takes place in the cargo industry is identity theft. He said Prosponsive Logistics “reported the phishing attack to DAT, and we worked with them to address it. We encourage all customers to report suspicious activity so we can respond appropriately.” To combat strategic theft, he said DAT employs a team that spots attempts at illegal activity about a dozen times a day. “We have a whole team of people that that’s all they do all day long — 25 people all day long — is chase these things down and remove those people that we know to be bad actors,” Hopper said. “Our biggest investment that we’re making is to fight that battle and to put the protections in place for our customers so that they don’t have to worry about that.” Targeting criminals before they disrupt the supply chain is the core business for Highway, a security company based in Dallas. “It’s like a virus,” Highway CEO Jordan Graft said in an interview. “So, whenever an industry or a segment becomes infected, it spreads. ... These aren’t just single individual actors deciding to wake up one day and say, ‘I’m going to target freight brokers in the U.S.’ They’re working in groups and cohorts.” Highway itself is also regularly targeted by criminal groups trying to infiltrate the security service and disrupt its ability to flag fraud to clients, it said. The company said its software blocked more than 914,000 fraud attempts last year. It also said 9,829 carrier users from 75 countries tried to get unauthorized access to its platform. The company said it believes those users wanted to steal the identity of legitimate motor carriers. Highway said most of those attempts originated from six countries: India, Mexico, Moldova, Pakistan, Serbia and Uzbekistan. Highway alerts its customers if there’s a change to a company’s phone number, email or address on the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s site, where shippers register. “If [hackers] can gain access to the carrier’s information, if they can get control of the carrier’s email inbox or they can phish the carrier to sharing a code with them, then they can change that information,” Graft said. “So, doing it thousands of times a month — it’s relatively easy.” He said the FMCSA needs better support to protect carriers, brokers and shippers, a concern that several brokers shared with CNBC. “I think they are doing the best they can,” Graft said. “You’re asking an under-resourced government agency whose mandate is motor carrier safety to try and attempt to fight a cybercrime attack on behalf of an entire industry.” Chris Burroughs, CEO of the Transportation Intermediaries Association, agreed that it’s been “too easy for these scammers” to hack the FMCSA system. “The fraud has been going on for years. These are well-organized crime rings,” he said. FMCSA spokesman Matt Schuck, in a statement to CNBC, said: “The agency continuously introduces security enhancements and upgrades to help safeguard the commercial motor vehicle industry and the American public. Recent initiatives to combat cargo theft include implementing multi-factor authentication across all FMCSA systems and strengthening security protocols. Additionally, FMCSA is developing a modernized registration system featuring even stronger safeguards and processes.” In response to the surge in cargo theft, U.S. Rep. David Valadao, R-Calif., along with other lawmakers, in April introduced a bipartisan bill called the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act. The bill would set up a coordination center within the Department of Homeland Security tasked with fighting cargo theft and organized retail crime. “It incorporates the FBI and Homeland Security,” Valadao told CNBC, “and it creates the task force [to] communicate with my local agencies but also amongst themselves so that they can be informed about what’s going on ... around the district or even around the country.” The legislation is pending. On the other side of Congress, the Senate Subcommittee on Surface Transportation, Freight, Pipelines, and Safety has taken a particular focus on cargo theft. “In this era of increasing permeability of our southern border, in particular, we’ve seen a lot of criminal elements come through, including those who are engaging in cargo theft,” said Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., who chairs the subcommittee. In an interview in his Senate office, Young said the FMCSA is “unable” to identify and remove fraudsters from online shipping systems. “That means a lot in this age of e-commerce, when people depend on this website,” he said, “to identify appropriate shippers and to trust in that information.” The Household Goods Shipping Consumer Protection Act, a bipartisan bill introduced in the Senate, would give the FMCSA authority to impose civil penalties and other stricter regulations against fraudsters.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: Public companies’ first loyalty is to shareholders — why do advertisers give them an easy time?

Best offer yet: Lock in a year of Digiday+ for 35% less. Ends May 16. Best offer yet: Lock in a year of Digiday+ for 35% less. Ends May 16. This article is part of a series covering our Programmatic Marketing Summit. More from the series → It’s late April/early May, and in any given year of the ad industry’s calendar, that means three concurrent series of events are taking place… in no particular order of importance, they are: In one, those pitching their wares on Madison Avenue make lofty promises about media quality and performance. Meanwhile, in the second series of events, the CEOs and CFOs of such outfits attempt to show Wall Street they are making good on their fiduciary obligations. In the latter, any disconnect between the former two categories is called out by disgruntled customers who can often feel they come off second-best as public companies attempt to juggle the two sets of obligations. The above dynamic played out at Digiday’s Programmatic Marketing Summit (DPMS) earlier this week. So, let’s examine the relevant Q1 results to gain perspective on this weeping and gnashing of teeth. At DPMS (May 5 to 7), Google’s recent U-turn around third-party cookies in Chrome, and its impact on the industry, was the ghost at the feast. Several participants noted how the latest development highlights Google’s lack of a clear plan and its challenges of making everyone happy, as demonstrated by its struggles with global regulators. However, some noted that clients are more focused on their own data and first-party data rather than third-party cookies, with several declining to debate Chrome’s “cookie crunch” further in self-directed sessions. With the upfront season on the horizon, the challenges of CTV and the need for transparency in targeting and measurement were more popular debates, particularly the need for transparency in show-level data to justify the prices on offer. Additionally, the need for (or lack of) differentiation between demand-side platforms and retail media networks was a common sentiment among the 300-plus attendees. Media agency participants engaged in one town hall session, conducted under Chatham House Rules, collectively said, “We come second-best once ad tech and platforms go public, then hidden fees, etc., become more common, and it feels like our trade orgs do nothing.” Simply put, many media agency attendees, particularly those from independent companies, claimed they felt used and abused, as ad tech outfits are increasingly making a play for direct relationships with their clients. This is especially the case as ad budget growth stalls, and publicly traded outfits attempt bid to maintain their stock price. Several town hall participants, including those from agency holding company outfits, expressed a desire to evaluate their DSP partnerships and explore opportunities to shift more spend to more favorable, i.e., transparent, platforms that better align with client needs. However, politics often impedes such desire, with joint business plans and holding company executives’ conflicts of interest cited as common obstacles to genuine game-changing efforts. In this environment, fee structures can escalate, from DSPs and platforms alike. “The amount of value the middlemen, with their DSP and SSP fees, are extracting greatly exceeds the value they’re providing,” said one participant. “Collectively, we’ve all let this middle layer grow; that’s imposing a giant tax with very little in return.” For many, it’s amid this dynamic that obsequious acceptance of platforms’ results is accepted. And, as recent research published by entities such as Adalytics highlights, ad tech and platforms alike require scrutiny, as advertisers’ budgets are not the only things at risk. “All of these companies are public, and if they actually did the right thing to improve and eliminate issues like MFA, which is maybe 20% to 40% of their revenue, then they’re going to lose,” noted another in the town hall. “As a public company, if they stop things like that, then I can’t imagine what would happen, just look at what happens to their price when they can’t show growth.” One participant even suggested that the industry bodies instituted to advocate for their interests may be compromised in this milieu, with several attendees noting the financial support outfits such as Google and Meta provide to entities such as the ANA and IAB, etc. “Anyone [such as a trade group] that’s pushed for open measurement, we’ve found that they [Big Tech platforms] have pushed against it,” observed another town hall participant. “I’ve never seen them come out in support of anything that makes change.” If you feel strongly about any of the issues discussed above, then feel free to get in touch – no PR pitches please. Sir Martin Sorrell’s AI bet: fear billable hours, more output-based deals. Nearly a year after he left Netflix, ad industry veteran Peter Naylor is back as a board member at ad tech business Kochava.

Title: The Return of The Stranger’s SIFF Notes

HELLO and welcome to The Stranger’s 2025 SIFF Guide! We have returned to our tradition of “attempting to watch every single SIFF film,” and are proud/exhausted to say that we made it through every single screener that was made available to us, so that you, dear reader, could be a little more informed about what rules, what sucks, what is beautiful, and what is incomprehensibly boring. It’s our labor of love, though, to be able to do this. Seattle International Film Festival has brought independent cinema to Seattle for over half a century, and with funding and movie theaters becoming more scarce (please, I beg of you, someone with money, turn the old Broadway Rite Aid back into a theater—the sign is still there and everything!), independent film is more important than ever to celebrate. Below, you’ll find a handy key. UNSCREENED means we weren’t able to obtain a screener by the time of printing, even though we asked a lot, and really nicely. Of the 100-plus we did see, you’ll find we RECOMMEND 32 of them, while there are another 18 we insist you DON’T MISS (threat). But you do you—one person’s “gender-bending lo-fi Frankenstein comedy” is another person’s “supernatural thriller starring a dog,” as they say. So dig in! Rating Key: ★ Recommended Don't Miss Unscreened 1-800-ON-HER-OWN USA, 2024 (78 min), Dir. Dana Flor Ani DiFranco has lived a fascinating life. She’s self-released more than 20 albums, he’s an ardent activist, using her platform to speak out against homophobia, racism, and other inequalities. She’s worked with orgs that make music education accessible to kids, spoken out against predatory major labels, and collaborated with everyone from Prince to Cyndi Lauper. So it’s unfortunate to hear that Dana Flor’s DiFranco documentary 1-800-ON-HER-OWN is “a pedestrian musician documentary” (New York Times) and “a snooze” (The Hollywood Reporter). (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 19–20; streaming May 26–June 1) MEGAN SELING 40 Acres Canada, 2024 (113 min), Dir. R.T. Thorne It’s a classic premise: a pandemic sparks war, famine follows, and resources rule all. By post-apocalyptic standards, the Freeman family farm is thriving until a band of cannibals arrives. The first act is fun, but the cannibals fall flat as soon as we get a good look at them. Instead of standing on their own characterization, they play more like inconsistently styled homages to other horror-movie cannibals. With no background or motivation, it would be easy to miss the allegory to white colonial violence if the movie weren’t called 40 Acres, if the son didn’t sleep under a Fred Hampton poster, if the film didn’t prominently feature a book report on The Proletarian’s Pocketbook, etc. The cannibals feel more like an interruption of the family’s discussions of—rather than part of a story about—race and colonialism. I would have loved to see that movie. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 16, May 21) BRIGID KENNEDY April Georgia, 2024 (134 min), Dir. Dea Kulumbegashvili After a baby dies during delivery, the father calls the police. The hospital launches an inquest. Nina, the hospital’s leading OBGYN, who delivered the baby, is an expert called in for every complicated birth. But Nina has a secret, which the aggrieved father knows: “I know you give abortions in the villages,” he says. “You’re a murderer.” I assumed a film about abortions in rural Georgia, a country where the procedure is restricted, would be sad. April is scary. It’s a mostly quiet story punctuated by shocking moments, and the menace of masculine control hangs heavy over this film. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 16, SIFF Film Center May 17) VIVIAN McCALL Auction France, 2024 (91 min), Dir. Pascal Bonitzer Pascal Bonitzer’s Auction, is based on a true story, in which an auctioneer discovers an authentic Egon Schiele painting (exciting!), but learns that it went missing in 1939 after being confiscated by the Nazis (oh no). (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 16, Shoreline Community College May 18) MEGAN SELING Baby Doe USA, 2025 (100 min), Dir. Jessica Earnshaw It’s easy to assume you’d never not know you were pregnant, all the way up until you gave birth. “How would that even happen?” is a question I myself have asked. But, like most assumptions, it’s worth deeper consideration. Gail Ritchey is a mother, grandmother, wife, and devoted church member from a conservative Christian community in rural Ohio who was leading a very ordinary life until police knocked on her door to question her about fetal remains found in 1993, leading to her arrest for murder. Her children and husband (who is the father of her living children, as well as the deceased) are understandably shocked, but stand by her side as they navigate the psychology of pregnancy dissociation and denial, and how aspects like religion, shame, resources, and politics might lead to unimaginable circumstances. Baby Doe is an empathetic look at a very complex topic, something the legal system is rarely equipped to understand or accommodate. It’s heavy stuff, but I do think it’s mind-opening and worth viewing. (AMC Pacific Place May 20, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 21) EMILY NOKES ★ The Balconettes France, 2024 (104 min), Dir. Noémie Merlant In Portrait of a Lady on Fire, star Noémie Merlant’s directorial debut, tensions and libidos run high as Marseille is caught in a sweltering heat wave. The titular “Balconettes” are Nicole (Sanda Codreanu), a sexually frustrated novelist; Elise (Merlant), a glamorous actress retreating from the overzealous attentions of her possessive husband; and Ruby (Souhelia Yacoub), a carefree camgirl. When the roommates flirt with the mysterious man on the balcony across from their building, a series of devastating events is set in motion. What starts out as a feminist take on Rear Window (starring Merlant as the consummate Hitchcock blonde) soon shifts into a surrealist revenge fantasy full of bright colors and unapologetic physicality: titties hanging out, farts, orgasms, etc. The effect is something like an episode of Broad City as directed by Pedro Almodóvar. One thing’s for sure: You’ll never look at a rocking chair the same way again. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 18, SIFF Cinema Downtown May 19) JULIANNE BELL BAR USA, 2025 (89 min), Dir. Don Hardy It’s said the BAR (Beverage Alcohol Resource) 5-day program is like the PhD of mixology—difficult to pass, expensive to attend, and, according to the attendees, a life-changing experience packed with education and camaraderie. BAR follows a handful of the program’s attendees on their journey through spirit schooling and mastercraft. Yes, there is a certain overproof rizz that comes with some BAR personalities, but the film’s at its best when waxing about “being in the people business.” During a particularly heartfelt diversity workshop, a speaker put it best: “Everything we do…must be truly grounded in making sure that people are, at the very least, respected, considered, thought about, and then hopefully made to feel happy and comfortable.” Cheers to that. (AMC Pacific Place May 17–18; streaming May 26–June 1) EMILY NOKES Beef Spain, 2025 (85 min), Dir. Ingride Santos Lati is a young Malian woman living with her family in Barcelona. Her father is dead, and her mother wants her to be a good Muslim, but she “only dreams of becoming a famous rapper.” Fuck yes! Sold. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 16, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 22) MEGAN SELING ★ Beginnings Denmark, 2025 (96 min), Dir. Jeanette Nordahl The complexity of love, the intimacy of caretaking, and the fragility of “normal” come together in a quiet, painful dance in this unflinching Danish drama. Ane and Thomas, on the brink of divorce, seem to hate each other the way only people who love each other can, until Ane’s sudden stroke detonates their unhappy-but-familiar equilibrium. It’s a bleak ordeal through the relentless, pitiless humiliation of failing health and forced dependency. It’s also a captivating, compassionate story of survival and suffering that resists cheap emotional shots, carried by some devastatingly amazing acting. Don’t watch this on a first date… but do watch it. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 22–23) FOX ALLISON ★ Between Goodbyes USA, 2024 (96 min), Dir. Jota Mun Mieke is a Danish woman, adopted from South Korea as a baby. Having lost both her adoptive parents, she’s getting to know her birth family, who still reside in Korea. The documentary focuses on that complex, fragile relationship, and we, the viewers, are invited into some uncomfortably intimate, vulnerable moments as they wade through decades of love and heartbreak. Mieke’s parents spent every day of her life loving her and wishing to find her, but they struggle to come to terms with core things like her Danishness and her queerness. The language barrier between them stands in for all the barriers built from regret, time, and distance. The family’s story, though, is far from over. They’ll keep working on their relationships long after the cameras stop rolling. (AMC Pacific Place May 24–25; streaming May 26–June 1) FOX ALLISON Billy Canada (Québec), 2024 (107 min), Dir. Lawrence Côté-Collins It’s an intriguing premise: After her fellow filmmaker, Billy Poulin, goes to prison for murder, Lawrence Côté-Collins stitches together clips from hundreds of hours of Poulin’s personal video footage to form a portrait of sorts of his undiagnosed and untreated schizophrenia. As she updates Poulin on her progress through letters and phone calls, Poulin begins to understand the scope of his illness. But Billy falls frustratingly short as Côté-Collins inserts herself into the narrative—and glosses over Poulin’s victims and the impact of his crimes—in a way that’s more opportunistic than sincere.

Juan Olea Each day, Pacífico (Francisco Melo) drives his workers from a desolate desert road in Northern Chile to an abandoned mine nearby. He’s searching not only for gold, but a way out for his teenage daughter, Carola (Katalina Sánchez). But after he fires his drunk of an employee, Humberto, everything goes terribly wrong. This tightly plotted, tense neo-Western is about how, as one miner puts it, “when there’s gold, the devil shows.” For clever Carlona, that evil is not only simple greed, but the patriarchal structures that define her dust-covered, hardscrabble world. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 16, May 22) VIVIAN McCALL ★ BLKNWS: Terms & Conditions USA, 2025 (113 min), Dir. Kahlil Joseph If you like your Blackness bold, creative, eccentric, complex, profound, mind-blowing, thought-provoking (hell, if you just like Blackness), Kahlil Joseph’s “cinematic installation” BLKNWS: Terms & Conditions is your flick. A mixtape of images, histories, and imagined futures, it refuses easy description like it refuses the white gaze. From Du Bois to Raekwon, Million Man March to Ghanaian streets, encyclopedias to encrypted futures—this is Blackness remixed and re-centered. Joseph invites us into a world where history flashes like strobe lights (epileptics beware), and meaning pulses through image, sound, and silence. This isn’t a movie. It’s an experience. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 18–19) MARCUS HARRISON GREEN ★ Blue Road: The Edna O’Brien Story Ireland, 2024 (100 min), Dir. Sinéad O’Shea Sinéad O’Shea’s new documentary chronicles the life of Irish novelist Edna O’Brien and her ascent from a whimsical child in rural Ireland to a trailblazing writer unafraid to challenge the Roman Catholic attitudes and shame toward sex. Consisting of archival footage and contemporary interviews with O’Brien (just before her passing last year), the film doesn’t just document an interesting subject, but does so with great care and humanity, capturing her fearless spirit and rebellious attitude. Immediately after watching the film, I frantically searched for used copies of The Country Girls trilogy on eBay, so I’d call the movie a success. Some of my favorite Edna-isms in the film include: “Women don’t just need the vote, they need to be armed,” and “I knew I was doing something right by how angry my husband was.” (AMC Pacific Place May 16, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 20) AUDREY VANN Blue Sun Palace USA, 2024 (116 min), Dir. Constance Tsang Tsang immediately proves herself a master of tight-space framing in her feature-length debut, ostensibly about a Queens massage parlor but really about so much more. Every bedroom, kitchen, lobby, stairwell, divey restaurant, rooftop, and mini-mall in Blue Sun Palace is immaculately staged. Fluorescent lights become angelic. Brief stutters of the hand after a bad phone call land like daggers. And intimacy, disgust, and grief fly off the screen in sequences that convey mountains of wordless emotion. Tsang’s trust in her cast pays off handsomely, as she lets conversations play out with zero cuts and one camera tucked into a tight room’s quarters. The results—the laughs, the bashfulness, and the stone-eyed stares—feel uniquely and powerfully American, as a Mandarin-fluent cast grapples with identity, homesickness, community, loss, isolation, violence, and shame in ways I haven’t seen in a SIFF film in some time. Bravo. CW: Sexual assault. (Shoreline Community College May 19, AMC Pacific Place May 24) SAM MACHKOVECH Boong India, 2024 (93 min), Dir. Lakshmipriya Devi Coming-of-age film Boong has all of the hallmarks of a first-time director overreaching. Plot lines either resolve abruptly or dangle. Characters don’t get enough room in either dialogue or action to become fully realized. And tone shifts dramatically, jumping from cheekiness to melodrama to heartbreak, often enough to distract viewers from fully connecting to its plot. But Boong also exists as a rare document of border clashes, ethnic conflicts, and family bonding inside the Indian state of Maripur—especially since they completed principal filming mere weeks before a civil war broke out that continues to this day. Thus, the film stands out for its unique and compelling perspective of Northeast India in a real-world zone that’s no longer easy to film. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 22, AMC Pacific Place May 25; streaming May 26–June 1) SAM MACHKOVECH The Botanist China, 2025 (96 min), Dir. Jing Yi The premise of The Botanist seems simple: A 13-year-old boy is raised in a small community by his grandmother and falls in sweet, chaste puppy love with a neighbor girl. But, if the reviews are to be believed at least, the thing that makes this film special is the setting: the northern Chinese province of Xinjiang, just across the border from Kazakhstan. The Hollywood Reporter describes it as “an isolated community…where life goes on as if modern technology never existed,” and Screen Daily said it “runs dry on cohesive narrative.” But they all agree it’s very pretty. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 23, Shoreline Community College May 24) HANNAH MURPHY WINTER ★ By Design USA, 2025 (90 min), Dir. Amanda Kramer Camille (Juliette Lewis) becomes enamored of a “stunner” of a chair she can’t afford, to the extent that she wishes she could become it. (“Oh, to be someone’s favorite thing.”) Her wish is granted—her spirit enters the chair, her body left inanimate. The people in her life continue on, monologuing around her limp form (Lewis is great at eyes-open draping), too self-absorbed to notice that she’s not entirely there. Meanwhile, an emotionally distant pianist named Olivier has fallen for the Camille chair; he can’t wait to get away from his vapid art community to spend time with her/it. By Design is surreal, aesthetically interesting (lots of MCM, but the strange lighting and proportions feel more uncanny than twee), and has the deadpan dialogue of a play. Themes include: literal objectification (obvi), tokenism, and maybe something about fetishization and consumerism? Absurdism as emotional truth? When a film is so avant-garde that you can tack almost any deeper interpretation onto it, you have to wonder if there actually is one. Or if you just need to sit with it longer. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 20–21; streaming May 26–June 1) EMILY NOKES By the Stream South Korea, 2024 (111 min), Dir. Hong Sang-soo For last year’s SIFF roundup, I watched Hong Sang-soo’s In Our Day, in which next to nothing happened: A cat ran off, a poet drank an ill-advised beer, and three women murmured over a box of toiletries. This came as no surprise, because disguised within the mundanity of all Hong’s interpersonal films are lo-fi reflections on the cosmic mysteries of identity, vulnerability, and life itself. In By the Stream, the question is this: “What kind of person do you want to be?… How about saying it through improvised poetry?” One of the film’s quiet strengths lies in its nuanced depiction of artists—a weaver who creates in centimeters-per-hour, an actor who runs a bookshop by the sea. It’s a refreshing reprieve from that annoying film trope of artist-as-wacky-abstract-painter. Expect something akin to Aki Kaurismaki and Eric Rohmer’s storytelling here. People talk, people think, and then the film ends. It leaves you thinking, too. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 20–21) LINDSAY COSTELLO Cat Town, USA USA, 2025 (73 min), Dir. Jonathan Napolitano Terry and Bruce Jenkins are an aging couple who have lived a big, adventurous life together, and in their golden years have converted their property into an elderly cat sanctuary called Cat’s Cradle—a place where older cats who are “out of options” can live out their lives and “be well loved again.” My HEART. Terry likes taking care of the more pragmatic tasks while Bruce creates obstacle courses and fiddles with technology like live-streaming. Birthday parties are thrown, catnip taste tests are conducted, and we get to know some of the retirees. The Jenkinses have a deep reverence for these cats, and the reality of their work is very bittersweet. It’s also very inspiring. We need more folks like these. Animals are the best of us, and people who are kind to animals deserve the world. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 22, May 24; streaming May 26–June 1) EMILY NOKES ★ Chain Reactions USA, 2024 (101 min), Dir. Alexandre O. Philippe Swiss-American documentarian Alexandre O. Philippe has a longstanding preoccupation with American cinema history—he’s made films that look deeply at The Exorcist, Alien, and David Lynch’s love affair with The Wizard of Oz. It makes sense, then, that Phillipe would appreciate The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which (hot take incoming) is one of the best American films ever made. Chain Reactions is a straightforward celebration of the film: It launches directly into five interviews, which are interspersed with scream-heavy TCM clips and scenes from related flicks. Stephen King, Karyn Kusama, Takashi Miike, film critic Alexandra Heller-Nicholas, and Patton Oswalt(?!) meditate on TCM’s avant-garde, experimental spirit. (Oswalt has some surprisingly poetic things to say about the film, including comparing its title to “chewing on flesh.”) If you’re interested in Tobe Hooper’s legacy and TCM’s connections to, say, Days of Heaven, Picnic at Hanging Rock, Bergman, or Tarkovsky, you’ll dig this. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 16, AMC Pacific Place May 17) LINDSAY COSTELLO The Chef & the Daruma Canada, 2024 (90 min), Dir. Mads K. Baekkevold Director Mads K. Baekkevold covers a lot of ground in The Chef & the Daruma. On its surface, it’s about Hidekazu Tojo, one of the most famous sushi chefs in North America (he says he invented the California roll!). But while Tojo tells his story of how he went from cooking out of necessity for his large family in Japan to charging $330 a head for the top-tier Omakase experience at his Vancouver, Canada restaurant, we also learn more about the history of sushi, the region’s long-standing racism against Japanese-Canadians, how a Daruma works, how sake is made, and which contemporary Vancouver chefs, inspired by Tojo, are breaking new barriers in Vancouver’s food scene. I felt like I was watching different vignettes or episodes of a series, more than a well-rounded documentary. Still, it’s a thoughtful and gentle journey, filled with people who appreciate food. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 24–25) MEGAN SELING Cloud Japan, 2024 (124 min), Dir. Kiyoshi Kurosawa If ever an action-thriller could be described as “quiet,” Kurosawa’s Cloud fits the bill. (No, not Akira Kurosawa. This is Kiyoshi Kurosawa, the one who made Cure, Pulse, and other moody, often-overlooked J-horror gems.) Cloud’s murky nightmare unfolds in the world of digital dropshipping, which lands ruthless seller Ryôsuke in real-life danger when a band of buyers take issue with his get-rich-quick scheme. The slow, calculated action-thriller communicates in soft steps and hushed tones, broken only by the occasional gunshot beneath overcast—cloudy, even—skies. Cloud treads tricky terrain, though. I won’t spoil the story entirely, but it unravels in a way that strains plausibility. It’s clear the real villain isn’t Ryôsuke, but the suffocating grip of late-stage capitalism. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 19, May 25) LINDSAY COSTELLO ★ Coexistence, My Ass! USA, 2025 (95 min), Dir. Amber Fares Coexistence, My Ass! is a documentary about the activist and comedian Noam Schuster-Eliassi, a woman raised from birth to believe Israeli Jews and Palestinians could live in peace. This movie tells the truth that occupation and apartheid led to the genocide in Gaza, and it shows Schuster-Eliassi’s sincere political evolution as she comes to realize that the oppressed cannot coexist with their oppressor, that coexistence is only possible between equals. Certainly, she cares. But for all the talk about checkpoints, about fascism and violence, this is an Israeli story. Glimpsed mostly in shots of iPhones and television screens, the horrors in Gaza and the West Bank feel far away. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 24–25) VIVIAN McCALL Color Book USA, 2024 (98 min), Dir. David Fortune Color Book, gorgeously rendered in black and white, tells the struggle of a newly widowed father trying to take his disabled son, Mason, to his baseball game. There is a lot going on here about love, loss, fatherhood, and community, but all I could focus on is how the true villain of this tale is the infrequent, unreliable Atlanta transportation system. As you watch Color Book, take note of how many times the dialogue is simply “Mason!” uttered in every shade of emotion known to man. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 24–25; streaming May 26–June 1) NATHALIE GRAHAM Come Closer Israel, 2024 (107 min), Dir. Tom Nesher Grief is messy, and so is Eden, a young woman reeling from the sudden death of her younger brother. A sexy, hard-partying wild child and avatar of bisexual bad-influence stereotypes, she carves a swath of chaos through the lives of everyone around her. Her discovery of and connection with her brother’s secret girlfriend is an interesting exploration of how shared loss can build bonds in the most surprising places, but the narrative is hindered by a sense that Eden’s exaggeratedly unreliable character was written by PTA parents terrified of their children “partying.” (She’s also got shockingly long, sharp fingernails for someone in a lesbian relationship.) There are poignant moments, to be sure, but I struggled to find anything to care deeply about. (SIFF Film Center May 20, May 22; streaming May 26–June 1) FOX ALLISON Come See Me in the Good Light USA, 2025 (104 min), Dir. Ryan White Winner of Sundance’s Festival Favorite Award, Come See Me in the Good Light is a documentary that follows Colorado’s Poet Laureate Andrea Gibson and their partner Megan Falley after Gibson is diagnosed with ovarian cancer and given two years to live. Variety called it “A luminous portrait of two poets navigating an incurable diagnosis,” and Salon said, “this film delivers hope and goosebumps in equal measure.” Bonus: It’s produced by Brandi Carlile and Tig Notaro. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 17–18) MEGAN SELING The Crowd Iran, 2025 (70 min), Dir. Sahand Kabiri Taking place in modern day Tehran, The Crowd tells the story of the planning of a going-away party for a beloved friend by his largely queer community. Over the course of the day, we are shown how this friend group is dealing with the recent death of one of their own, as well as how they navigate the suffocating oppressions of a patriarchal society that views homosexuality as punishable by death. As grim as this all might sound, The Crowd is ultimately a film about platonic love and perseverance, and the celebration of love and community. Shot over the course of 12 days in a playful visual style with collage elements mixed in (personal phone videos, photos, social-media screenshots), The Crowd is a sweet tribute to those leaving and those who have left. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 23, May 25) MICHAEL McKINNEY Dancing Queen in Hollywood Norway, 2025 (87 min), Dir. Aurora Gossé This movie was definitely not made for me. Yes, I love hip-hop and hip-hop dancing. But the way I enjoy these forms is not at all represented in any part of this film, which has a bunch of Norwegian kids going to LA to do their hip-hop dance thing. The filming is ugly, and the acting is barely above what we find in Kenan & Kel. In the words of Skepta: “That’s not [for] me.” (Shoreline Community College May 16, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 19) CHARLES MUDEDE The Dark Crystal with DJ NicFit USA, 1982 (93 min), Dirs. Jim Henson and Frank Oz This screening of Jim Henson and Frank Oz’s beloved puppet-filled fantasy flick is hosted by Cross-Faded Cinema, with DJ NicFit providing a live remixed soundtrack. Sometimes, Cross-Faded screenings include other surprises, too, like balloons or bubbles! There’s no telling what DJ NicFit has in store. (I hope it’s Fizzgig. I really want to hug Fizzgig.)

Grace Glowicki SIFF describes Dead Lover as a “bizarre, performance art-coded, gender-bending lo-fi Frankenstein comedy about a lonely gravedigger who will do anything to build the perfect man.” If that intriguing word salad doesn’t pique your interest, consider this: SXSW’s film jury awarded Dead Lover with the NEON Auteur Award, describing it as “a tremendously original film.” (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 23, AMC Pacific Place May 24) MEGAN SELING Deaf Spain, 2025 (99 min), Dir.

(SIFF Cinema Uptown May 17–18; streaming May 26–June 1) MEGAN SELING ★ Diamonds Italy, 2024 (120 min), Dir. Ferzan Özpetek Whoa boy. Diamonds opens with director Ferzan Özpetek hosting a dinner for his 18 favorite actresses (“you are my diamonds!”), asking them to be in his film, which begins a few moments later. This metacinematic device is odd, but fine. That is, until we unnecessarily revisit the director’s table again midway through? The film inside the documentary tells the story of a women-led costume shop set in Rome in the ’70s. The set design and fashion are gorgeous, and everyone’s face is fun to look at, but the script is so incredibly predictable it veers into camp. Which I can get behind! By the time the Özpetek is inserted again, though, it’s clear he needs to center himself so you don’t forget who should be celebrated for celebrating these women. It’s such a brazen move I couldn’t do anything but laugh. Recommended if you’re like, day-buzzed on daiquiris and want a little spectacle (to laugh at, not with). (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 24–25) EMILY NOKES Diciannove Italy, 2024 (109 min), Dir. Giovanni Tortorici Director Giovanni Tortorici drew inspiration from his own life while writing his feature-length directorial debut, Diciannove (Nineteen).

Unkovski It’s not easy being 15 in Northern Macedonia, especially for Ahmet, whose little brother, Naim, clams up in the wake of their mother’s death and whose dad obsesses over his fixing his brother’s muteness in all the wrong ways. Ahmet must abandon the usual hallmarks of teenagerdom (going to school, going to forest raves in the middle of the night) to instead schlep the family’s tobacco crop to market and tend to the family’s sheep. But, while diligently tending to the sheep, Ahmet, still a teenage boy, can’t help himself—he falls in love. With a girl trapped in an arranged marriage. Uh oh. The children of DJ Ahmet are trapped by the conservative traditions of their society and by the myopia of their own parents. Only through music—the thing Ahmet and Naim’s late mother cherished—and the slivers of technology they have access to, can the kids connect with each other, themselves, and begin to carve out the lives they want to start living.

Embeth Davidtz Film adaptations of successful books can be unpredictable, but Embeth Davidtz’s interpretation of Alexandra Fuller’s critically acclaimed 2001 memoir Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight, about Fuller’s childhood in a white Zimbabwean family after the Rhodesian Bush War, appears to be a success. (Shoreline Community College May 17, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 20) MEGAN SELING Drowned Land USA, 2025 (86 min), Dir. Colleen Thurston (Choctaw Nation) It’s easy to think about environmental destruction mostly in big-picture terms. Drowned Land zooms in to tell the story of the Kiamichi River as not just an ecologically important body of water, but an ancestor, a being, a heart. It highlights the throughlines between cultural displacement, oppression of Indigenous people, and exploitation of natural resources. (It’s hard to think about the environment in the abstract when you’re reminded that in 2025, small, discarded communities are plagued by water too contaminated to safely wash dishes in, let alone drink.) The energy industry is a titanic foe, but the Choctaw Nation and other activists are steadfast in fighting back. As Thurston, the filmmaker, says, “This isn’t a redemption story, but it is a story about reclamation.” (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 16, Shoreline Community College May 20; streaming May 26–June 1) FOX ALLISON Drowning Dry Lithuania, 2024 (88 min), Dir. Laurynas Bareiša As with Moon (see my review, also in this guide), Drowning Dry begins with a mixed martial arts competition. But unlike Moon, the movie’s key character, Lukas, wins. And, after celebrating this win, he and his family (wife, son, sister-in-law, brother-in-law, niece) go to a country house by a lake to relax. Slowly, cracks begin to appear. But these are very human cracks. In fact, the film is really a work of philosophical anthropology that’s expressed with two narrative modes: one in which little happens slowly, and one in which a lot happens slowly. When the latter occurs, we are exposed to the terrifying frailty of the human condition. To intensify the experience of the modes, the film employs only diegetic music and naturalistic lighting and shot positions. The result is, for me, the best movie I have so far seen in SIFF. (SIFF Film Center May 17, Shoreline Community College May 22) CHARLES MUDEDE Evergreens USA, 2025 (120 min), Dir. Jared Briley Spokane-based director Jared Briley didn’t take shortcuts when crafting his directorial debut, Evergreens. When Eve and James set out on a road trip through Washington State, we see “heaps of gorgeous shots of Leavenworth, Seattle, Bainbridge, and the forests and waters in between.” It also features music by Damien Jurado and Lacey Brown.

Nabil Ayouch Touda (Nisrin Erradi) is a young woman who lives in a remote part of Morocco and dreams of making it big as a traditional dancer and singer. She has a son who is treated like shit at school because of his disability. And her jobs often expose her to sleazy men and sexual violence. One day, she decides to move to Casablanca to make her dreams come true. The movie, though visually gorgeous and filled richly with music and dancing, ultimately feels unreal. I’m not sure if this was the intention of the director, Nabil Ayouch, but Touda’s journey unfolds and even floats from scene to scene like a fairytale. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 22–23) CHARLES MUDEDE Familiar Touch USA, 2024 (91 min), Dir. Sarah Friedland It is no wonder Familiar Touch won “Best Debut Film” at Venice Film Festival and has several other awards under its belt already. Sarah Friedland takes us through a poignant character study of Ruth Goldman (Broadway legend Kathleen Chalfant), who has lived a full life, only to have it scrambled by severe dementia in the end. For anyone who has worried about the effects of dementia on our loved ones, or stayed up late wondering where our parents will spend the rest of their lives, this film hits you straight in the chest. Kathleen Chalfant’s performance is a Master Class through the slow-moving, gorgeous cinematography that is Familiar Touch. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 18, Shoreline Community College May 25) RACHEL STEVENS Flamingos: Life After the Meteorite Mexico, 2024 (83 min), Dir. Lorenzo Hagerman Flamingos are strange. With their absurdly spindly legs, weird beaks, and cartoon coloring, they look like a bubblegum sculpture whose artist ran out of gum and had to stretch what they had to the point of absurdity. This documentary was clearly made by people who love flamingos. It’s full of gorgeous footage of the birds flying, wading, nesting, incubating, and mating. (Flamingo sex is hilarious, by the way, especially when set to bizarrely sexy music.) The storytelling format is a bit wobbly, and some scenes drag on too long to let the filmmakers use all the music they paid for, but there are plenty of worse things to sit through than an excess of beautiful nature shots. (Pacific Place May 23, Shoreline Community College May 24; streaming May 26–June 1) FOX ALLISON Fly Me to the Moon Hong Kong, 2023 (112 min), Dir. Sasha Chuk Fly Me To The Moon tells the story of a family from mainland China who have just migrated to Hong Kong to make a better life for themselves. Beginning in the late ’90s, the film spans two decades, focusing on the coming of age of two young daughters as they come face to face with the growing pains of the migrant experience. While trying to escape social ostracization from schoolmates through assimilation, the daughers find that things are not any easier at home as their father falls into a pattern of drug use and petty theft and is in and out of jail over the course of their adolescence. The film is a slow meditation on growing up and how we forgive, forget, and forge new paths in light of broken dreams.

Darren Thornton In this Irish remake of the 2008 Italian film Mid-August Lunch, gay author Edward’s (James McArdle) queer coming-of-age novel unexpectedly becomes a viral BookTok hit. Forced to choose between embarking on a book tour in the US or staying home to take care of his ailing mother (Fionnula Flanagan), who has suffered a stroke and can only communicate via iPad text-to-speech, he sabotages himself by avoiding going after what he wants…until his self-serving gay friends unceremoniously dump their mothers at his home so they can abscond to Maspalomas Pride. Edward, Alma, and their three new houseguests form an unlikely found family, resulting in an impromptu road trip to visit a medium. The film doesn’t hit every beat and meanders into predictable territory at times, but it’s got plenty of charm, and Flanagan speaks volumes with her arresting facial expressions without uttering a single word aloud. (Opening Night: Paramount Theater May 15) JULIANNE BELL Free Leonard Peltier USA, 2025 (110 min), Dirs. Jesse Short Bull (Oglala Sioux) and David France In January, directors David France and Jesse Short Bull probably thought they were done with their documentary, Free Leonard Peltier. The Sundance date was set. Then one week before the film’s premiere, President Biden announced he was commuting Peltier’s contentious life sentence. But critics say timing isn’t the only thing that sets this film apart from previous projects—Variety praised it for having a “wider focus” than 1992’s Incident at Oglala, “placing the incidents detailed here in the context of America’s long and shameful history of exploiting, betraying, and even murdering Native people.” (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 17–18; streaming May 16–June 1) MEGAN SELING ★ Freeing Juanita USA, 2024 (74 min), Dir. Sebastián Lasaosa Rogers In 2014, as immigration to the US from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador skyrocketed, Mexico committed to detaining migrants as they passed through Mexico, rather than allowing them to cross the US border. That same year, Juanita, an indigenous Guatemalan who speaks Maya, not Spanish, was detained by the Mexican government, and confessed to a crime in a language she didn’t speak. Freeing Juanita tells the story of her aunt and uncle, who journeyed a thousand miles from their home in the Guatemalan mountains to advocate for her release. As a human-scale story, it would be striking at any time, but this year? Their vulnerability and determination strike especially deeply.

It opens on a floating raft in an alternative pre-millennium universe. A young sex worker (Annapurna Sriram) is on a raft, telling a psychic (Big Freedia) about how she’s losing her teeth. She’s cursed, the psychic says. And for the low, low price of $1,000 and an innocent lamb, she can break it. So she takes off into this fictional world, called Trashtown, where the cops are Tom of Finland doms and the fancy hotel is called Fancy Hotel. The journey to finding the cash to break the curse is campy, bloody, and full of other bodily fluids. The story will break your heart a little, but it’s worth it.

(SIFF Cinema Downtown May 18) MEGAN SELING The Gloria of your Imagination USA, 2024 (98 min), Dir. Jennifer Reeves The Gloria of your Imagination is either a tough or a really easy sell, depending on who you are. The “dual-projection performance” shares footage from recorded therapy sessions with a 30-year-old single mother in 1964. Gloria, perfectly coiffed, chain-smoking, and toting a wicker pocketbook, shares her anxieties about men, sex, and motherhood with three spectacled dudes, who emit varying levels of douchiness: Gestalt founder Fritz Perls (who calls Gloria “phony” in session), humanistic psychology founder Carl Rogers, and rational emotive behavior therapy founder Albert Ellis. The audience learns that Gloria consented to having the sessions filmed, but not to their being publicly exhibited—which they were, widely. Gloria sues for damages. This reveal causes me to question, then, my complicity in watching the sessions now. After all, The Gloria of your Imagination encourages conclusions that most of us have come to before—the ’60s were an exceptionally sexist time, and modern psychotherapy has its flaws. (SIFF Film Center May 19–20; streaming May 26–June 1) LINDSAY COSTELLO Good Boy USA, 2025 (73 min), Dir. Ben Leonberg It sounds like a gimmick—a supernatural thriller starring a dog—but Good Boy has received some impressive accolades since debuting at SXSW earlier this year. Horror movie homebase Dread Central called it “surprisingly poignant,” the Hollywood Reporter praised the film’s emotional power, and Indiewire gave it an A-, calling Indy the dog’s performance “affecting.” (Spoiler: DoestheDogDie.com promises that Indy survives.) (AMC Pacific Place May 24, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 25) MEGAN SELING Hanami Switzerland, 2024 (96 min), Dir. Denise Fernandes “I think that inside of us, the broken pieces are put together with gold,” says Nana, the central character, in a voiceover in the opening scene. She’s referring to Kintsugi, the Japanese practice of repairing broken pottery with gold powder, highlighting the cracks as a part of its history. But Nana’s speaking from a whole different volcanic island in a whole different ocean: Fogo, Cape Verde. Part coming-of-age story, part surreal fever dream, Hanami follows Nana’s young life, grappling with being left in Cape Verde by her mother, the community that cares for her, and having to decide what “home” actually means to her.

Scandar Copti Oscar-nominated Palestinian director Scandar Copti’s new film gives us an enlightening look into the oppressive everyday lives of a middle-class Arab family living in Israel. Told through a series of vignettes focusing on different members of the family, the film explores how the countries’ divisions affect almost all aspects of their daily lives, from navigating relationships and dating, to dealing with cultural conventions and expectations. How does one find personal agency when all of the external forces around you feel so constricting? (SIFF Film Center May 21, AMC Pacific Place May 22) MICHAEL McKINNEY Happyend Japan, 2024 (113 min), Dir. Neo Sora In Japan’s near future, the authoritarians are in control. They use an impending, once-in-a-century earthquake to justify police crackdowns on immigrants and political dissidents. For Yuta and Kou, two best friends set to soon graduate high school, it’s just daily life. It isn’t until the principal responds to their daring prank and installs a new AI-powered security system called Panopty (get it?) that the country’s crumbling politics become real. Kou sees them one way, Yuta another, threatening their friendship. Happyend is about how people react when the unthinkable happens. Do they decide? Do circumstances of race and class decide for them? Is the answer somewhere in the middle? A film for our political age, Happyend is a must see. (AMC Pacific Place May 22–23) VIVIAN McCALL ★ Heightened Scrutiny USA, 2025 (90 min), Dir. Sam Feder Last year, ACLU attorney Chase Strangio became the first trans attorney to argue before the US Supreme Court in the first big trans-rights case of this second shitty Trump era. The question at the center of US v. Skrmetti: Was the state of Tennessee violating the constitutional rights of transgender kids when it banned puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapy to treat gender dysphoria, while allowing doctors to offer the exact same treatments to intersex and cis kids for different medical reasons? Heightened Scrutiny makes the high-as-fuck stakes clear through shots of community meetings and serious interviews with serious people sitting in bare rooms, pizzicato strings plucking away seriously in the background. But it’s also a sweet profile of Strangio, who says arguing a case before the court is not his dream, but a nightmare for a nice normal guy with an albatross of responsibility around his neck. It’s not the most intimate profile—it couldn’t be, Strangio is a high-profile, media-trained lawyer—but Feder’s made a political document worth seeing. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 18–19; streaming May 26–June 1) VIVIAN McCALL Home Sweet Home Denmark, 2025 (112 min), Dir. Frelle Petersen Do you want to see the kind of work immigrants in the USA do? Well, watch this movie, which concerns a Danish woman, Sofie (Jette Søndergaard), who, though white, is a home care worker. This film is raw. It doesn’t hide a damn thing. You see it all: caregivers (some of whom are Black) cleaning penises, handingly bodies that are about to fall apart, putting dentures into mouths, and so on. The film is slow (even monotonous) but boy does it tell like it is. It’s hard being an old person in a capitalist (USA, UK, Denmark) society. You are lonely, waiting for death, and completely dependent on caregivers who are often poorly paid immigrants. (AMC Pacific Place May 20–21) CHARLES MUDEDE How to Build a Library Kenya, 2025 (100 min), Dir. Maia Lekow and Christopher King Variety describes How to Build a Library, a documentary by Maia Lekow and Christopher King, as “straightforward, methodical.” It features two Kenyan woman restructuring, over several years (their project began in 2018), a colonial-era library in the heart of their country’s capital, Nairobi. This work of transformation turns out to have numerous difficulties, one of which, not surprisingly, is the stubbornness of the post-colonial government. Anyone who has lived in an English-speaking African country knows the British did a number on the locals. Undoing what Fela Kuti famously called “colonial mentality” is like moving a mountain. (May 16, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 21) CHARLES MUDEDE I Am Nevenka Spain, 2024 (112 min), Dir. Icíar Bollaín I Am Nevenka is a biographical drama about Nevenka Fernandez, the plaintiff in Spain’s first case in which a politician was convicted of sexual harassment. Variety called the case “a landmark judicial sentence 15 years before the #MeToo movement.” As a big fan of made-for-TV Lifetime movies, I’m especially intrigued by what movies review magazine Little White Lies had to say about it: “It’s a trashy, tabloid-y film, but it’s a fine one, and a story that still needs to be told again, and again, and again.” (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 21, Shoreline Community College May 23) MEGAN SELING Idyllic Netherlands, 2025 (99 min), Dir. Aaron Rookus This dense Dutch film is made with great care and intelligence. At its center is an opera singer, Annika (Eelco Smits), who is facing the nothingness of a death that will soon consume her glamorous life. The heaviness of her situation, which is always in her eyes and her gestures, streams to all the other parts of the film’s sprawling story, which easily could have been a TV series. (AMC Pacific Place May 17–18) CHARLES MUDEDE ★ Into the Wonderwoods France, 2024 (80 min), Dir. Alexis Ducord and Vincent Paronnaud You know when you have a dream where there is one big mission, but seemingly hundreds of side-plots with too many characters to count? And then you wake up and you’re like, “That was AWESOME.” Into the Wonderwoods is that fever-dream. This animated film has been translated from French to English, but you know the French are freaky AF, and it shows in this adventure of a 10-year-old boy, Angelo, who gets separated from his family and travels through a forest filled with ogres, robots, magic landscapes, and more. His imagination helps him brave the elements and even join a resistance. Into the Wonderwoods is for children ages 8 and above, and the young at heart. (Though I let my 5-year-old watch it with me and she hasn’t stopped talking about it since.) (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 17, Shoreline Community College May 18) RACHEL STEVENS Invention USA, 2024 (72 min), Dir. Courtney Stephens I love a movie that refuses to have a genre. Invention blends fiction and autobiographical documentary to something warm and a little bit magical. In this “meta fiction,” co-writers Courtney Stephens and Callie Hernandez create a fictional version of the immediate aftermath of Hernandez’s father’s death, but intersplices real found VHS footage of her own father. It’s messy, but so is grief. (AMC Pacific Place May 16, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 17) HANNAH MURPHY WINTER Jean Cocteau USA, 2024 (94 min), Dir. Lisa Immordino Vreeland Jean Cocteau is a perfect example of a documentary with a captivating subject, but unfortunately, bland filmmaking. While I appreciated that the film let the iconic Renaissance man speak for himself—weaving together interviews, journals, and clips from his films—narrative gaps were filled by walls of text that I found clunky and uninspiring. However, this was also the first biography of Cocteau I’ve seen that gives adequate attention to his identity as a gay man and love affairs with collaborators like Jean Marais, Raymond Radiguet, and Édouard Dermit. The film also touched on his controversial friendship with Nazi sculptor Arno Breker, but lacked a stance, quoting Cocteau’s belief that friendship is more important than politics. As the credits rolled, I wasn’t particularly surprised to see that the film was funded in part by fashion giant Chanel, whose founder, Coco (a known Nazi sympathizer), designed costumes for many of Cocteau’s stage productions. (AMC Pacific Place May 19, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 20; streaming May 26–June 1) AUDREY VANN John Cranko Germany, 2024 (135 min), Dir. Joachim Lang Without a doubt, John Cranko is no Amadeus. Nevertheless, it’s not half bad. The reason for this biopic’s success is found in the actor who plays John Cranko: Sam Riley. Most of us know Riley from another biopic, Control (he plays somber Ian Curtis). In this title role, he is the legendary and complicated South African choreographer who ran Stuttgart Ballet in the 1960s, John Cranko. Though highly entertaining, John Cranko offers nothing new. It has, like most biopics of its kind, scenes of the genius in a mess, the genius struggling with the establishment and lazy dancers, and, of course, the genius smoking like a chimney as he gives inspiring speeches that show why he is a genius. Rock me, Cranko. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 22–23; streaming May 26–June 1) CHARLES MUDEDE Joqtau Kazakhstan, 2024 (71 min), Dir. Aruan Anartay After several years abroad, young scientist Darkhan returns home to Kazakhstan with his girlfriend Elena, and they join his enigmatic grandfather on a trip to the plains of their ancestral homeland. In the opening credits, we learn the title refers to a traditional Kazakh mourning song, and that sense of quiet grief lingers throughout this sparse, poetic journey. Joqtau explores family legacy and cultural erosion, and the film style shifts fluidly between the intimacy of a family dinner and the observational feel of a documentary. As they move through the countryside, Elena remains a quiet observer as Darkhan slowly reconnects with his roots. Joqtau is low on plot but high on vibe, and it leaves its somber atmosphere behind after it ends. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 20, SIFF Film Center May 22; streaming May 26–June 1) BREE McKENNA Ka Whawhai Tonu: Struggle Without End New Zealand, 2024 (115 min), Dir. Michael Jonathan Rare is the coming-of-age wartime film that successfully combines wildly disparate tones, like sweetness and brutality, or humor and tension. Ka Whawhai Tonu’s unflinching look at the 19th-century New Zealand Wars is an astonishing example of consistent tone and spirit in a film about colonialist travesties. The film opens on a Māori tribe capturing a half-Māori, half-European teen boy ahead of a siege by European forces and mistreating him. A teen girl in the encampment, herself facing similar adult maltreatment, finds ways to help the boy, thus sealing their friendship—while also stoking tensions among leaders. There are no winners in this conflict as viewed through younger eyes (“adults made me something I’m not, for an adult’s war”), but through this film’s genuine anguish comes a remarkable document of the human spirit at its best—and its worst. Temuera Morrison has a hell of a performance as equal parts diplomat, commander, and elder, while Paku Fernandez’s teenage vulnerability and tenacity put the beautifully shot film over the top. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 16, Shoreline Community College May 18; streaming May 26–June 1) SAM MACHKOVECH Khartoum Sudan, 2025 (81 min), Dir. Anas Saeed, Rawia Alhag, Brahim Snoopy, Timeea Mohamed Ahmed, and Phil Cox In Khartoum, five directors collaborate with five refugees from different backgrounds to reenact their life-changing experiences in the Sudanese Civil War. Sometimes their stories are supported by props and CGI renderings of the places they’re describing; other times, they’re acted out in front of blank green screens with a boom mic dipping into frame. Either way, the subjects take turns acting in each other’s stories, positioned and fed lines as they go, often embodying people who had drastically different experiences than their own. It’s a collective effort with something to say about community, justice, and storytelling. Khartoum is special. (AMC Pacific Place May 19, May 21) BRIGID KENNEDY The Kingdom France, 2024 (108 min), Dir. Julien Colonna Sadly, this is not the 2007 action thriller starring Jamie Foxx! Instead, it sounds much more intense. SIFF’s provided description reads: “When an underground war breaks out between nationalist groups and crime families, a Corsican mobster and his daughter must go on the run, bringing them closer together and drawing her into his world.” Don’t let that scare you away! Julien Colonna’s 2024 Kingdom currently has a 100 percent critic rating on Rotten Tomatoes with 14 reviews from outlets including IndieWire and Variety, while Foxx’s Kingdom is sitting not-so-pretty at 51 percent. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 21, May 23) MEGAN SELING ★ Know Her Name Canada, 2024 (80 min), Dir. Zainab Muse Women were powerful in early Hollywood, and what happened will not surprise you. Money (and men) changed everything. In the freewheeling years before California lured the film industry west with tax breaks, it didn’t matter as much who was on set writing the scripts, running the cameras, or even cutting the checks (Alice Guy-Blaché made 1,000 films and ran her Solex studios in New Jersey—a “fine example of what a woman can do if given a square chance in life,” according to the Motion Picture News in 1911.) Then men took the whole thing over and still haven’t let go, more than 100 years later, enough time for us to nearly forget about pioneers like Guy-Blaché. Countless other women won’t even get that chance—75 to 90 percent of American films shot before 1929 are lost to time. Exactly why women were written out of history is a complex question, but it’s clear those opportunities never came back. Know Her Name does what only a good documentary can, unspooling the historical record so slowly and thoughtfully that it’s hard to pinpoint when a rage started smoldering in my gut. By the time the credits rolled, I didn’t just feel angry, I felt cheated out of great films that never were. (Shoreline Community College May 23, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 25; streaming May 26–June 1) VIVIAN McCALL The Librarians USA, 2025 (88 min), Dir. Kim A. Snyder Just six minutes into The Librarians, a librarian starts to cry. That’s how bad it is out there for those working in states such as Texas and Florida, where conservatives are calling for the removal of hundreds of books. While book banning is nothing new, it has grown to unprecedented levels in recent years, largely due to the right-wing organization Moms for Liberty. But the librarians aren’t having it. They’re fighting back. They’re defending their duty to ensure their school and public libraries are inclusive, welcoming spaces, and it’s costing them their jobs, their relationships, and, in some cases, their safety. But lest people think this all comes down to ethics and morality, The Librarians does a great job digging a little deeper to show that all the fighting, screaming, and literal book burning ultimately come down to one thing: money. You’ll leave the theater wanting to simultaneously hug a librarian and burn the world to the ground. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 16–17) MEGAN SELING Little Red Sweet Hong Kong, 2024 (92 min), Dir. Vincent Chow A young Chinese woman gives up her dreams of being a flight attendant and returns home to help run the family’s dessert shop after her mother suffers a stroke. Despite her sacrifices, her dad won’t let her in the kitchen to help make their famous, secret recipe red bean soup. Drama! One reviewer called it “undercooked.” One review we translated from Chinese reads: “It seems to be cleaned with bleach. It’s a clean movie, a movie without life.” (AMC Pacific Place May 21, Shoreline Community College May 25) NATHALIE GRAHAM LUZ Hong Kong, 2025 (102 min), Dir. Flora Lau Amid neon-streaked Chongqing’s nightlife scene, karaoke bar employee Wei (Guo Xiaodong) attempts to contact his estranged daughter Fa (Deng Enxi). Meanwhile, Hong Kong gallerist Ren (Sandrine Pinna) reconnects with her stepmother Sabine (the iconic Isabelle Huppert), who devotes her time to the Parisian art world and was recently diagnosed with a fatal aneurysm. One day, Wei and Ren cross paths in an open-world VR game called Luz, in which players navigate a dreamlike cyberpunk setting on a quest to find a shimmering, ethereal deer. The film has mesmerizing visuals and raises interesting questions about art, interpersonal connection in the digital age, and the blurred lines between artifice and reality, but unfortunately lacks the emotional substance to back it up. Nevertheless, Huppert delivers a standout performance as always, and it’s a joy to watch her vaping and dancing in the face of death. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 20, AMC Pacific Place May 22) JULIANNE BELL ★ Manas Brazil, Portugal, 2024 (107 min), Dir. Marianna Brennand Based on director Marianna Brennand’s decade of research into the sexual abuse of children and teenagers in the Amazon rainforest, Manas is as devastating as it sounds. The drama follows 13-year-old Tielle through a world where abuse is the norm of girlhood. The film moves slowly, lingering over every facial expression and piece of the story, featuring beautifully designed shots amidst the ugliness of its subject matter. At one particularly gutting moment, Tielle’s mother tells her, “there’s no use trying to change some things.” And yet, Tielle attempts to alter the generational script, as does this film, by creating this unflinching portrait of such a difficult topic. (SIFF Film Center May 16, May 18) ROBIN EDWARDS Meeting with Pol Pot France, 2024 (113 min), Dir. Rithy Panh If longtime Cambodian director Rithy Panh is new to you, and you’re horny for accolades, know this: His 1994 film Rice People was the first Cambodian film to be submitted for an Oscar and several of his films have shown at Cannes, including 2003’s S21: The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine, which won Prix François Chalais, and his 2013 documentary The Missing Picture which took home the Un Certain Regard title. So chances are, Meeting with Pol Pot, which is partly based on the book When the War Was Over: Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge Revolution by Elizabeth Becker, will not be bad. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 18, May 20) MEGAN SELING ★ Monarch City USA, 2025 (70 min), Dir. Titus Richard Monarch City is of great importance to the history of this region’s cinema, because it is Paul Eenhoorn’s last film. For those not familiar with this actor, who came from Australia and wound up in Seattle, he spent the last part of his life starring or appearing in a number of local indie films before dying in his sleep in Tacoma in 2022. His moment, however, arrived in 2014 with the film Land Ho!, which made a splash at Sundance, and concerned two elderly men enjoying all that Iceland has to offer. Monarch City is set in a town outside of Seattle. Eenhoorn plays Sam, a broken man in a broken town (alcoholism, drug addiction, crime, guns, dead dives, beat-up pickup trucks). Sam recites poetry about arriving at other shores. He smokes and drinks and carries a gun. And he ends the film with a meditation on death. Goodnight, Eenhoorn. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 20–21; streaming May 26–June 1) CHARLES MUDEDE Mongrels Canada, 2024 (111 min), Dir. Jerome Yoo If you consider yourself a dog lover, best beware that a bunch of them brutally bite the dust in this visually poetic, though ultimately scattered, directorial debut. Mongrels is told in three parts and centered on a Korean father tasked with killing dogs in the woods, his troubled son, and his imaginative daughter still trying to remain connected to her absent mother. The film follows the family as they begin to make a new life in small-town Canada. It thrives when it lets us sit with the more ephemeral sense of loss, though it eventually becomes overly literal. As one part fades into the next, hitting plenty of familiar coming-of-age beats, the portrait it tries to paint never quite comes into focus as beautifully as the visuals do. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 16, AMC Pacific Place May 17) CHASE HUTCHINSON ★ Monk in Pieces USA, 2025 (95 min), Dir. Billy Shebar and David Roberts The answer to everything is just to keep making art long enough that people finally get it and pronounce you a genius. At least that’s what I learned from this loving and insightful portrayal of avant-garde musician, director, and lifelong performance artist Meredith Monk. The documentary presents Monk’s work and life in a greatest-hits mosaic, featuring interviews with David Byrne, Philip Glass, and Björk. I especially loved seeing the evolution of sexist early reviewers calling her work narcissistic, self-centered (isn’t most art self-centered?), and, my favorite, “it made my cats bite each other,” to critics finally recognizing her impact and singular vision. All the while, she continued making delightfully freaky operas that feel plucked from another dimension in the same NYC warehouse she’s lived in since the ’70s with her pet turtle, Neutron. I dream of a Seattle where artists can make our work well into our 80s, too. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 16–17) ROBIN EDWARDS ★ Moon Austria, 2024 (92 min), Dir. Kurdwin Ayub After losing a big fight, a famous and top-rated Austrian martial arts fighter, Sarah (Florentina Holzinger), retires. But what is she to do with the rest of her life? She is still young and has a lot of time on her hands. Out of the blue, a rich Jordanian offers her a lot of money to train his sisters, who, he claims, have taken an interest in martial arts. It’s big in Jordan. Sara accepts the offer, flies to Amman, gets set up in a fancy hotel, and soon after is introduced to the sisters, who live in a gaudy mansion on the outskirts of the city. The first training session, however, goes badly. So does the next one. Eventually, it becomes obvious that something is profoundly wrong with the sisters, their brother, his bodyguards, and the mansion. The film becomes a thriller. What is really going on here? Is Sarah’s life in danger? Moon is great until the last 10 minutes. (SIFF Film Center May 22, AMC Pacific Place May 23) CHARLES MUDEDE The Nature of Invisible Things Brazil, 2025 (90 min), Dir. Rafaela Camelo There’s something so compelling about the way children make friends: trading secrets, building mythology, finding your own language of play. In The Nature of Invisible Things, that friendship unfolds between two young girls in a hospital—one spending her summer vacation with her mother, a nurse, and the other waiting for her granny to get well. The film passes back and forth between the stark realities of the hospital, and the surreal imaginations of children trying to make sense of the world around them. It has moments of being genuinely unsettling (it is a hospital after all) but most of the film is a frank portrait of two girls, their two moms, and how they all seek out joy.

Lanfia Wal When was the last time you saw a lo-fi, neon action movie with a virtually all-Black cast, knock-off Michael Jackson, and a scene pulled straight out of Street Fighter? If your answer is “never” (like mine was), New Jack Fury is your chance. It starts with someone getting hit with a dirty 18-inch dildo, and it ends with a dance off, swords, and betrayal. Watch this one, if only because you won’t see anything else like this self-aware, chaotic dreamscape for a long time. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 17, Shoreline Community College May 18; streaming May 26–June 1) HANNAH MURPHY WINTER The New Year That Never Came Romania, 2024 (138 min), Dir. Bogdan Mureşanu On one hand, The New Year That Never Came is an award-winning and critically acclaimed film about six lives intersecting on the streets of Romania on December 20, 1989. Their stories unfold throughout the day while Nicolae Ceaușescu’s communist regime famously falls. But with a movie poster that highlights the ensemble cast, I can’t help but imagine it as some kind of Love, Actually or New Year’s Eve rom-com starring Zac Efron and Katherine Heigl… but with a presidential execution at the end. I’d watch the fuck out of that. (AMC Pacific Place May 18–19; streaming May 26–June 1) MEGAN SELING Odd Fish Iceland, 2024 (104 min), Dir. Snævar Sölvason Odd Fish is Iceland’s first film about a trans woman. This is the story: Two old friends who run a cozy little restaurant in a lovely little town that attracts tourists from Norway and other such parts are about to finally get filthy rich because a corporation wants to bring visitors all year round. The restaurant can expand; the town can grow. What more do you want? After the good economic news, one of the restaurant’s owners and cook, Björn, comes out as a woman. This coming out was instigated by her father’s death. The other owner, Hjalti, is smashed by this transition. He is already homophobic. How can he work with a trans woman? Though this part of the film is important, it has no surprises. And what really amazes you are the wide shots that capture the cold and treeless beauty of this island from another planet.

Sook-Yin Lee I was pleasantly surprised by Paying for It, Sook-Yin Lee’s adaptation of her ex-boyfriend Chester Brown’s autobiographical graphic novel of the same name. The story is based on the couple’s real-life breakup, in which Lee searches for new emotional connections with other men while Brown altogether ditches the idea of romantic love and visits sex workers whenever he’s feeling horny. Paying for It could’ve easily devolved into a messy and overwrought hot take on the ethics of monogamy and the morality of sex work. Instead, it’s a realistic and thoughtfully paced portrayal of two people maneuvering new territory, both as individuals and as a bonded pair, in order to find what version of love and companionship makes them happiest. What’s right for them may not be right for everyone (or anyone) else, and that’s okay. It’s actually very sweet. Bonus: Director Sook-Yin Lee is scheduled to attend the screenings. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 17–18) MEGAN SELING ★ Raptures Sweden, 2025 (108 min), Dir. Jon Blåhed Shot beautifully in a bucolic Scandinavia, Raptures tells the story of Rakel, a traditional and devout Christian living in a small Swedish village in the 1930s. As her increasingly delusional alcoholic husband, Teodor, breaks away from the church to start preaching his own messages that come directly from God (red! flag!), she must navigate her own conflicting feelings and beliefs as the anxieties of a looming world war simmer in the background. Will a large crystal arc show up to save the believers? Is a Teodor sex party in the sectarian cult house really part of God’s plan? It’s Ingmar Bergman meets Midsommar, and it’s the first feature film ever with a main dialogue in the minority language Meänkieli. It’s also brilliantly acted and totally worth watching. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 23–24) MICHAEL McKINNEY ★ Ready or Not Ireland, 2025 (83 min), Dir. Claire Frances Byrne Dublin, 1998: A summer of firsts for Katie (Ruby Conway Dunne) and her friends. First kisses. First drinks. Realizing for the first time that the world, and boys, mean to eat up teenage girls. Conway Dunne and Molly Byrne, who plays her best friend Danni in the film, teeter believably on the edge of adolescence. When nobody is watching, they’re playful kids. At school and parties, they’re kids trying their best at being adults. Even though I didn’t care for all the voiceover (of the “record scratch, isn’t my life soo crazy” variety) or that the script seemed to have left what should have been subtext in big bold letters, I liked this movie because those kids acted like real kids—swearing, crying, and handling everything very poorly. I just had to know if they’d be okay in the end. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 21–22) VIVIAN McCALL Remaining Native USA, 2025 (87 min), Paige Bethmann Teenage cross-country phenom Ku Stevens aspires to leave his small Nevada town for college, but along the way, he wrestles with shadows of his Indigenous family’s American experience. At its best, this documentary offers an unblinking look at physical and cultural violence perpetrated by white Americans, all while humanely framing Native Americans’ continuing efforts to grieve, process, and persevere. The film’s strongest moments—particularly Stevens retracing his great-grandfather’s 50-mile running escape from a brutal boarding school—are hampered by poor pacing and editing decisions. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 17–18; streaming May 26–June 1) SAM MACHKOVECH Riefenstahl Germany, 2024 (116 min), Dir. Andres Veiel For decades, people have debated Leni Riefenstahl’s films. Was her Hitler-sanctioned documentary, The Triumph of the Will, historic filmmaking or Nazi propaganda? While my inclination is to roll my eyes and say, “Bitch was a Nazi, let her rot,” I’m intrigued by Andres Veiel’s documentary, Riefenstahl, which The Hollywood Reporter says highlights the “‘seductive nature of fascism’ both the 1930 variety and the updated versions of today.” (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 20, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 22) MEGAN SELING The Safe House Switzerland, 2025 (90 min), Dir. Lionel Baier Revolution! 1960s Paris! A Tenenbaum-esque multigenerational residence! So much to love about this film, right? Mais non, The Safe House falls flat. Taking place during the social uprisings in May 1968, France, the film focuses on the perspectives of a halfway eccentric middle-class family existing mostly domestically while violence ensues out in the streets. The film makes little (if any) real commentary on the politics of the time, and lacks any real emotion via family dynamics. And while I personally believe that a film can survive—if not thrive—on style over substance with the proper imagination, The Safe House is tepid at best in its art direction as well. The “quirky” visual and editing tricks are tired, and the voiceover muddies rather than helps the narrative along. While there are wisps of Tati and Godard in the DNA of this film, you are better off just visiting those directors’ films. Or Bertolucci’s The Dreamers, which is also about the May ’68 uprisings, but good. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 21, Shoreline Community College May 22) MICHAEL McKINNEY ★ Sally USA, 2025 (103 min), Dir. Cristina Costantini It wasn’t until seeing Sally that I realized flying into space may be one of the less impressive accomplishments on astronaut Sally Ride’s resume. Because you know what’s harder than getting four degrees at Stanford, pushing through years of grueling physical training, and getting taken seriously as one of fewer than a dozen women at NASA in the 1980s? Bearing the brunt of the world’s misogyny while hiding the fact that you’re gay, even from your closest friends and family for fear of how it could impact your hard-earned career. In Sally, Ride’s long-time partner Tam O’Shaughnessy introduces us to the side of Ride that Ride was too scared to share while she was alive. We get to meet the complex, vulnerable woman behind the confident public figure. It’s as inspiring as you’d expect a documentary about a trailblazer to be, but with a hefty, bittersweet, even heartbreaking, dose of reality. (Shoreline Community College May 21, SIFF Cinema Downtown May 22) MEGAN SELING Salsa Lives Colombia, 2025 (101 min), Dir. Juan Carvajal Did you know salsa, the dance, not the sauce, was born in New York City? Existing rhythms in Cuba, Cuba Son and Afro-Cuban rumba merged with American jazz to create the hip-swiveling dance. Since its Big Apple inception, salsa has spread across the world. But, nowhere is it more popular these days than in Cali, Colombia. Salsa Lives traces that spicy history in what’s supposed to be a vibrant—NOT MILD—experience.

Stephen Quay and Timothy Quay To the outside world, in his home country, Józef’s father is dead. But inside the walls of this dingy, remote sanatorium, he is alive. Sort of. His death simply hasn’t arrived yet. Time is different here. It lags. It stretches, skitters, and loops. But that’s grief for you, rendered here in beautiful and surreal stop motion. I liked this movie enough to buy the short story collection it was based on—Polish Jewish writer Bruno Schulz’s meditation on his father’s death (published five years before the Gestapo shot the writer dead). But I’m patient. I enjoy wondering what’s going on. If you can’t stand ambiguity, Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass may have you checking the sign of your watch. Stephen and Timothy Quay fans will know the film is a sequel of sorts—their most well-known work is 1986’s Street of Crocodiles, another Schulz adaptation. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 18, May 23) VIVIAN McCALL Scarecrow in a Garden of Cucumbers USA, 1972 (82 min), Dir. Robert J. Kaplan If you are a fan of any of the following, then Scarecrow in a Garden of Cucumbers is a must-watch for you: the early films of John Waters, vanilla ice-cream cones, ostrich-feather boas, and Buster Keaton-style physical comedy. Robert J. Kaplan (whose only other directorial credit is the pornographic Jaws spoof Gums) directs this long-lost camp masterpiece starring Warhol superstar and transgender icon Holly Woodlawn as she flees her boring Kansas upbringing to make it as an actress in New York City. Along the way, she meets an eccentric cast of characters, including a sailor-mouthed nun, misandrist twin sisters, and a revered lounge singer named Mary Poppins (played by fellow Warhol superstar Tally Brown). I am so pleased to see this film receive a snazzy restoration and a proper theater screening—I predict a Criterion release is on the horizon. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 24) AUDREY VANN Seeds USA, 2025 (122 min), Dir. Brittany Shyne Director and cinematographer Shyne spent nine years watching and listening to Black farmers in rural Georgia, and the end result is impossibly beautiful. Like any documentary, you see these families through her eyes, but from the families, you rarely feel the self-consciousness that comes from being watched—which just reveals how much time and patience Shyne put into this project. Shot all in black and white, the film is quiet, allowing for the long, languid pauses of rural life. But it only takes a few scenes to fully pull you in. This film won Sundance’s best documentary for a reason. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 17–18) HANNAH MURPHY WINTER ★ She’s the He USA, 2025 (81 min), Dir. Siobhan McCarthy This queer teen comedy starts, like many teen comedies do, with a harebrained deception scheme. Playing on conservative hysteria surrounding all-gender bathrooms, She’s the He finds best friends Ethan (Misha Osherovich) and Alex (Nico Carney) pretending to be trans to enter the girls’ locker room at school, leading Ethan to the realization that she actually is trans. The quick-witted film with a majority trans cast checks off the high school movie tropes, including makeover scenes, a blooper reel, and raunchy jokes, while creating tender moments where Osherovich’s full-hearted performance makes the coming-out story shine. It’s a lot of fun! And the costumes were so cool, I went back to the credits to track down who the designer was (Leah Morrison) and creepily requested her private Instagram. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 19, AMC Pacific Place May 20) ROBIN EDWARDS ★ Shepherds Canada (Québec), 2025 (113 min), Dir. Sophie Deraspe In this funny, existential drama, a burned-out Québécois marketing executive sends a fuck-off email to his bosses, gives away his possessions, maxes out his credit cards, and flees to the south of France. Dreaming of a simpler life, he wants to become a shepherd. He clumsily introduces himself to local farmers who immediately clock him as a privileged city boy with no clue what he’s doing. He stumbles from one farm to the next, debating work, God, and the treatment of sheep with stubborn, set-in-their-ways French sheep wranglers until he finally lands his big break herding in the idyllic Alps. While struggling to get a work visa, he meets a hot and charming bureaucrat who, even as she’s denying his paperwork, finds herself won over by his reckless sincerity. Shepherds is messy, earnest, and very, very French. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 23, Shoreline Community College May 25; streaming May 26–June 1) BREE McKENNA Slanted USA, 2025 (104 min), Dir. Amy Wang Imagine if The Substance was about teenagers instead of adult celebrities, and instead of wanting to defy aging, it was about changing race. Slanted, the newest project from Amy Wang, centers on Joan Huang (Shirley Chang) and her pursuit of absolute assimilation: becoming prom queen. To fit in, Huang goes under the knife to change herself from Asian to white. Slanted mixes surrealism, slapstick comedy, and body horror. The people seem to love it—it won the Narrative Jury Award at SXSW— though they do say the middle drags a bit. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 24–25) NATHALIE GRAHAM Sons Denmark, 2024 (111 min), Dir. Gustav Möller Sons is the feel-bad film of the fest that, for all its bleak reflections about violence, punishment, and humanity, ends up saying surprisingly little. This is a shame, as writer-director Gustav Möller’s previous film, The Guilty (SIFF 2018), was a well-crafted work of genuine dread. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 23, May 25) CHASE HUTCHINSON Sorry, Baby USA, 2025 (101 min), Dir. Eva Victor After her world is shattered by her advisor sexually assaulting her, grad student Agnes (writer and first-time director Eva Victor) attempts to regain control of her life while living in the same sleepy New England college town and taking a professor job at her school. Victor deftly navigates a minefield of a topic with humor, grace, and quiet but powerful authenticity, resisting clichés about survivors in favor of demonstrating the unexpected healing properties of stray kittens, kind strangers, and a really good sandwich. The heart of the film is Agnes’s unconditional relationship with her ride-or-die lesbian best friend Lydie (Naomi Ackie), who supports her throughout her recovery despite moving away and doesn’t hesitate to consider helping Agnes commit arson. Bottom line: An astonishing debut and an irrefutable case for more movies made by women about their experiences. Please see this film. (Closing Night: SIFF Cinema Downtown, May 24) JULIANNE BELL ★ Souleymane’s Story France, 2024 (92 min), Dir. Boris Lojkine He has no papers. He comes from Guinea. He is young (mid-20s) and Black. His name is Souleymane, and in two days, he must, during his application for asylum, convince French authorities that he was beaten and imprisoned in Guinea for his political views. The problem? He is not political at all. He came to Paris to work. And the work he does is at the bottom of the city’s gig economy: He delivers food orders on an electric bike. The biker can’t afford to be late or to get an order wrong because that would result in a bad review, and a bad review would result in the app shutting him out of the network and out of much-needed work. To make matters worse, he has to share half of his meager earnings with Emmanuel, whose face is used to open and operate the app (as Souleymane can’t legally work in France). The Paris we see during the dash from one order to the next is far from the one that draws millions of tourists. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 22, May 24; streaming May 26–June 1) CHARLES MUDEDE Spermageddon Norway, 2024 (80 min), Dir. Tommy Wirkola and Rasmus A. Sivertsen I could call Spermageddon a big stupid cum joke. But that would be selling it short. It’s about ballsack, too. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 16, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 18) VIVIAN McCALL ★ Starman USA, 2025 (85 min), Dir. Robert Stone Space exploration used to mean something, damn it. As of this writing, Katy Perry and co. just completed their bizarre 11-minute space trip bankrolled by the losers that are actively ending the planet we live on, so I got a kick out of hearing from Gentry Lee. Lee is a jet propulsion scientist, robotics engineer, and sci-fi author who has worked at NASA since the early ’70s and LOVES what he does. Lee yell-talks directly at the camera about his work on missions like Viking, marveling at how big of a deal it was to actually make it to Mars, and what it felt like to be in the room “solving problems that no one had ever had before” (we’re talking prodigies doing STEM with a fraction of the assistance of today). Starman isn’t saying anything new, but if you can get on Lee’s level, it is kind of mind-blowing to hear it told from a real one. Come for the gold Voyager record, stay for the footage of Carl Sagan slaying a turtleneck. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 16, Shoreline Community College May 17) EMILY NOKES Suburban Fury USA, 2024 (120 min) , Dir. Robinson Devor “There comes a point where the only way to make a statement is to pick up a gun,” says Sara Jane Moore, the woman who attempted to assassinate President Gerald Ford in San Francisco in 1975. Suburban Fury is directed by Robinson Devor, the same guy who brought us Zoo, with a little help from The Stranger’s own Charles Mudede. Devor gains historic access to Moore, who sheds light in an unpolished, often unreliable interview on how she went from a conservative suburban housewife to an FBI informant on radical political groups to an almost assassin. Suburban Fury tells Moore’s story at the same time it paints a picture of a decade of radical politics, braiding in footage of the Black Panthers, the Gay Liberation movement, the Attica Prison Rebellion, the United Farm Workers movement, and Patty Hearst’s kidnapping. Moore becomes convinced that killing Ford will expose the machinations of a government not for the people and inspire a revolution. While it centers on the 1970s, the political moment it captures doesn’t feel far off in 2025. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 21, May 23) NATHALIE GRAHAM Sudden Outbursts of Emotions Finland, 2024 (97 min), Dir. Paula Korva Sudden Outbursts of Emotions gets increasingly superficial the longer it carries on. It tells the story of a woman who, when not working at a travel agency, is burdened with soothing the fragile ego of her insecure boyfriend as his acting career seems to have stalled. She begins to question her life and relationship, just as said boyfriend suggests they open their relationship and attend a sex party where she meets someone new who will soon upend all she thought she knew about herself. At least, that’s what it feels like it ought to be, in theory. But the execution is far too narrow, and it’s oddly afraid to lay bare the body or the soul. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 18–19) CHASE HUTCHINSON ★ Summer’s Camera South Korea, 2025 (82 min), Dir. Divine Sung A young girl discovers a secret after developing film on her deceased father’s camera. She also realizes that she is a lesbian after taking photographs of her school’s popular soccer star. Either of those plots may sound like they contain drama, but the pacing is peaceful; at all the moments you might expect turmoil, there is instead a surprisingly frictionless story. It’s subtle. Maybe too subtle. But it’s very beautifully shot, tender in its understatement, and culminates in a truly moving final scene. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 21–22; streaming May 26–June 1) EMILY NOKES Tales From the Magic Garden Czech Republic, 2025 (71 min), Dir.. David Súkup, Patrik Pašš, Leon Vidmar, and Jean-Claude Rozec LA stop-motion, ethereally animated movie about children trying to fill the void they feel after losing their grandmother, their family’s storyteller. Critics ponder who is the audience for this movie because it is definitely a children’s movie, but the subject matter is, well, kinda morbid. They also say it’s slow. However, a reviewer at Loud and Clear said it’s “a gorgeous stop-motion animated tale that’s both an ode to the resilience of children and a reminder that we’re never not going to need to feel safe and looked after.” (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 18, May 25) NATHALIE GRAHAM The Things You Kill Canada, 2025 (113 min), Dir. Alireza Khatami You don’t have to read interviews with writer and director Alireza Khatami to know that he’s a fan of David Lynch: It’s all over his work. It’s in the way he calmly bends reality; the way he turns a nameless Turkish city into a character in the film; and the way he kills his central characters. Most people have described The Things You Kill as a thriller, but I don’t think it has quite enough tension to earn that title. It does have relentless foreshadowing: a pistol tucked in a water tank, mirror images that become reality, the haunting phrase “kill the light” leaking from a nightmare. But the narrative itself is quiet and methodical. The unraveling of one man as he faces his own impotence, an ailing mother, an abusive father, and an impossible moral dilemma. (AMC Pacific Place May 23–24) HANNAH MURPHY WINTER ★ Time Travel Is Dangerous United Kingdom, 2024 (99 min), Dir. Chris Reading British besties Megan and Ruth run a vintage shop called Cha Cha Cha. They find a time machine in the alley and off they go, recklessly nicking items from any era they please to stock their shelves (and sometimes just to get takeaway from a closed restaurant). A group of inventors get involved because the machine is damaging the universe, of course. Listen, this film is deeply goofy. Almost every line of dialogue is a joke. I would not call the budget “big.” But the humor is British, which goes a long way—it’s styled as a mockumentary but is doing the tropes well enough that you’re legit enjoying the references? I was skeptical, I was, but then for whatever reason the more ridiculous shit they added, the more I thought, “yeah okay, swing big, why not.” The retro vibe is fun, and the characters are likeable. Just eat an edible, love. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 23–24, streaming May 26–June 1) EMILY NOKES Tinā New Zealand, 2024 (103 min), Dir. Miki Magasiva Tinā (which means “mother” in Samoan) is part Sister Act 2 (with rich kids, though), part Samoan grief opera, and part slow-burn school drama set in post-earthquake Christchurch. After losing her daughter in the 2011 quake, Mareta—a grief-stricken but quietly formidable teacher—takes a job at a posh Catholic school where the students are privileged, the staff are casually racist, and the choir doesn’t yet exist. She builds one from scratch, connecting with emotionally closed-off kids while working through her own loss. There’s class tension, personal tragedy, and who doesn’t love when all roads in the high school movie lead to a high-stakes music competition? The pacing is slow, but the film is carried by Mareta’s low-key intensity and culminates in a genuinely very moving final performance. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 18–19) BREE McKENNA To a Land Unknown Greece, 2024 (106 min), Dir. Mahdi Fleifel This one looks dope, in a tense, traumatic way. To a Land Unknown is the story of Chatila, a Palestinian refugee living in Athens, and barely making ends meet. He’s caught in between existences—longing to get out of Athens and escape to journey while hovering on the periphery of Athens’ seedy underbelly. Chatila meets and connects with a variety of other refugees, people whom the audience may start to care for, only to eventually discard them for his own ends. As The Guardian writes, “[Director Mahdi Fleifel] allows us to invest in characters who are to disappear from the story, so we too can experience the emotional wasteland in which Chatila lives.” (AMC Pacific Place May 23, Shoreline Community College May 24) NATHALIE GRAHAM ★ To Kill a Mongolian Horse Malaysia, 2024 (97 min), Dir. Xiaoxuan Jiang In the past few years, the contemporary Western has emerged as a genre whose best films are often directed by women, a welcome shift from the traditional Western’s realm of heteronormative and patriarchal values. Chloé Zhao’s The Rider and Jane Campion’s The Power Of The Dog come to mind, and with To Kill A Mongolian Horse, Xiaoxuan Jiang joins this pantheon in her directorial debut. Her film sets itself apart, though, by being set in her native Inner Mongolia (an autonomous region within China) rather than the American West. It’s a fascinating look at a man who is stuck between wanting to honor his culture’s traditions in a countryside that is rapidly changing, and trying to make a living in the modern city, a place he feels he doesn’t really belong. With modernity itself emerging as the metaphysical foe of the cowboy of the 21st century, the contemporary Western has become a much more complex genre than its traditional counterpart. (AMC Pacific Place May 18, May 20; streaming May 26–June 1) MICHAEL McKINNEY Transfers Argentina, 2024 (90 min), Dir. Nicolás Gil Lavedra Transfers does not recount the full history of Argentina’s Dirty War period of 1976–83. Instead, this documentary focuses on one central and terrifying aspect of that military dictatorship’s reign: a biweekly series of “death flights” that dumped thousands of political prisoners to their brutal ends. By largely removing political pretext from the story—only brief mentions of socialism or communism—Transfers hammers home the utter depravity of the Argentinian regime for its actions, and also easily draws out metaphors for, er, certain modern regimes. Argentina’s administration freely destroyed internal records, lied to the media, and targeted mild offenses with brutality... but also enjoyed decades of relative impunity until persistent efforts turned up results. Those efforts are bravely recounted by remaining, living advocates in a crucial documentary that’s admittedly tough to watch, especially when victims’ mothers flood city streets to protest, only to become targets themselves. (SIFF Film Center May 18, May 20; streaming May 26–June 1) SAM MACHKOVECH Twinless USA, 2025 (100 min) , Dir. James Sweeney Fellas, is it gay to bond with a man over your shared grief after losing your twin while also pondering your place in a disconnected modern world? James Sweeney, the brilliant writer, director, and co-star of Twinless, says probably yes (complimentary), and so much more with this terrific dramedy that we can’t tell you almost anything about so as not to spoil the dark fun. What can be said is that Twinless sees Sweeney and Dylan O’Brien playing two troubled Portland guys who meet at an emotional support group for those who’ve lost an identical sibling. However, nothing is what it seems, and the film becomes the funniest, most chaotic, and ultimately most emotionally impactful movie to ever include key scenes surrounding attending Seattle Kraken games. (SIFF Cinema Uptown May 24–25) CHASE HUTCHINSON ★ U Are the Universe Ukraine, 2024 (101 min), Dir. Pavlo Ostrikov U Are the Universe is an indie drama about a man left adrift in space after the world as we know it is destroyed, who forms a connection with what may be the last other survivor. It’s creatively constructed and carves out its own distinct place in the well-worn genre, with the set design and visual effects proving remarkable, even before you learn that Ukrainian filmmaker Pavlo Ostrikov made it during the ongoing Russian invasion. It’s a love story of sorts with plenty of mirth, but also a mournful meditation, ripping the air from your lungs when it counts. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 22, May 25) CHASE HUTCHINSON Unclickable Greece, 2024 (113 min), Dir. Babis Makridis Ad fraud, in which fraudsters show fake people fake websites that attract real ads for profit, may account for every third dollar spent on digital advertising, and it’s a hair-on-fire problem that director Babis Makridis lays squarely at the feet of Google and Facebook. The movie is convincing: I buy that ad fraud is a huge problem, likely killing local newspapers, funding misinformation, and plain ripping people off. For those reasons alone, governments should force big tech to deal with it. I also buy Makridis’s moral revulsion. But for a movie about what’s supposedly one of the biggest criminal schemes of our age, it’s boring, and the soundtrack (mostly fingers rocking back and forth between two notes on a Casio keyboard) nearly drove me insane. (SIFF Film Center May 19, SIFF Cinema Uptown May 22; streaming May 26–June 1) VIVIAN McCALL Under the Volcano Poland, 2024 (102 min), Dir. Damian Kocur In Under the Volcano, a Ukrainian family’s chill beach trip to the Canary Islands turns existential overnight, as Russia launches its full-scale assault on Kyiv. While sunscreened Brits chug sangria nearby, Anastasiia, Roman, Sofiia, and Fedir spiral into panic, anxiety, and guilt while stranded in a paradise turned hellscape. Director Damian Kocur and co-writer Marta Konarzewska dial up the tension beautifully, letting family resentments bubble under the picture-perfect surface while in the shadow of a literal sleeping volcano. Through Gen Z daughter Sofiia’s eyes, we watch the strange numbness of survival unfold in real time. Grim, visually gorgeous, and timely as ever, Under the Volcano will hit you in your gut. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 16, Shoreline Community College May 20; streaming May 26–June 1) MICHAEL McKINNEY Undercover Spain, 2024 (118 min), Dir. Arantxa Echevarría Spanish thriller based on a true story! The late 1990s! A young female police officer in San Sebastian infiltrates the Basque terrorist group, ETA! Lead actress Carolina Yuste (known for Sky High—but not the Sky High Disney movie about a high school for superheroes) stuns, according to reviewers. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 17, May 20) NATHALIE GRAHAM Viktor Denmark, 2024 (89 min), Dir. Olivier Sarbil Viktor is a samurai-obsessed, deaf, Ukrainian photojournalist who wishes he were a soldier. Director Olivier Sarbil really, really wants you to know all that, but Viktor is at its best when Sarbil gets out of the way. Throughout (especially in the too-perfect ending) Sarbil and Viktor are telling us two separate stories, and I prefer Viktor’s. His sullenness clashes with the swelling music and close-ups of bombing victims’ hands in plastic bags. It’s refreshing—they may air raid you every night, but they’ll never take your freedom to be a little bitchy when you get a haircut you don’t like. If you want a straight documentary about this war, watch 20 Days in Mariupol. If you’re more of a vibes guy and it won’t piss you off to watch a film about a photographer who never once gives us a clear view of his photographs, Viktor’s worth your time. (SIFF Cinema Downtown May 17, May 19; streaming May 26–June 1) BRIGID KENNEDY The Village Next to Paradise Somalia, 2024 (113 min), Dir. Mo Harawe A breakout from the 2024 Cannes Film Festival, The Village Next to Paradise delivers a “sensitive and empathetic” view of Somalia, “an underappreciated and often vilified nation.” The film centers on a family struggling to not only survive, but thrive in a village where drone strikes fill the sky and living until tomorrow never feels like a sure thing. (SIFF Film Center May 19, May 21) NATHALIE GRAHAM The Wailing Spain, 2024 (107 min), Dir. Pedro Martín-Calero Don’t confuse this with the Korean flick by the same name. This Wailing is a precise, stylized, femme-centered horror film. Martín-Calero—previously best known for directing a music video for the Weeknd—breaks the narrative into three distinct stories:, each led by a different young woman that’s stalked by (or stalking) something inescapable. (Shoreline Community College May 17, AMC Pacific Place May 25) HANNAH MURPHY WINTER Waves Czech Republic, 2024 (131 min), Dir. Jiří Mádl While watching Waves, which is set in Soviet-era Czechoslovakia, I got lost in its marvelous lighting and wardrobe. I could not get enough of both, scene after scene. True, the film’s story is relevant (journalists facing censorship or worse, dictators oppressing freedoms, and the like), but, ultimately, it didn’t say much more than this: “democracy dies in silence” (and, in this film, radio silence). (Shoreline Community College May 21, SIFF Cinema Downtown May 24; streaming May 26–June 1) CHARLES MUDEDE ★ Wolf Land USA, 2025 (71 min), Dir. Sarah Hoffman We should get this out of the way: Wolf Land is basically a dating profile for its featured player. Sure, the documentary thoughtfully explores the tension between wildlife advocates and ranchers, but then Daniel Curry’s mop of curly hair rides into the prairie, and, well, GOOSH. Tall, handsome, kind to animals, drops dad jokes, advocates intelligently for animal cohabitation, bridges political divides, and lives with his many pets (including three cutie-pie Dobermanns, who appear in a framed photo in his Eastern Washington cabin labeled “The Lads,” ARE YOU KIDDING ME). In good news, there’s more here, particularly how Curry and a rancher eke out a sweet, surprising friendship. (Shoreline Community College May 17, AMC Pacific Place May 18) SAM MACHKOVECH

Title: Stocks Rip To 6-Week High And Bitcoin Prices Top $100,000 As Trump Stokes Rally
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2025/05/08/stocks-rip-to-6-week-high-and-bitcoin-prices-top-100000-as-trump-stokes-rally/
Time Published: 2025-05-08T16:21:00Z

ByDerek Saul ByDerek Saul, Forbes Staff. The stock and cryptocurrency market comeback from the tariff crash was in full swing Thursday, as President Donald Trump expanded investors’ risk appetite. Stocks have recovered all of their "Liberation Day" losses and then some. You better go out and buy stock now,” Trump said Thursday from the Oval Office. That direct encouragement accelerated an equity market rally which began as the president showed further inclination to back off of his most aggressive trade war plans and brandished a new trade deal with the U.K., the first such agreement of his second term. All three primary barometers of the U.S. stock market surged to multi week highs, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit its highest level since April 2, the S&P 500 notched its top price since March 27 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq touched its highest level since March 26. The Dow rose 570 points, or 1.4%, by early afternoon, while the S&P climbed 1.4% and the Nasdaq popped 1.8%. Trump’s encouragement to buy stocks mirrored his messaging ahead of the 90-day pause he placed last month on the most aggressive of his country-by-country tariffs. Digital assets rode optimism of trade war deescalation to solid gains, as the three most valuable tokens – bitcoin, ether and XRP – each rose at least 3.9% in the 24-hour period ending midday Thursday. Bitcoin, by far the most valuable crypto asset, topped $100,000 for the first time since Feb. 4 during the rally. All but one of the S&P’s 13 sectors gained Thursday, but it was the “magnificent seven” grouping of big tech companies championing the rally. Shares of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla were all up at least 0.8%, led by Tesla’s 4% gain, as the growth-focused septet enjoyed Wall Street’s move to risk. Bloomberg’s index tracking the seven stock rose 2%. The S&P tallied its longest winning streak in 21 years from April 22 through last Friday, erasing what was a 12% loss from April 2 through April 8 as Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs wreaked havoc. The benchmark is still down 7% from its February peak. The bounce comes even as Trump engages in a stare down with the U.S.’ top monetary policy official, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The Fed declined to lower interest rates this week as it waits to see further evidence of how Trump’s tariffs will work their way through the economy, much to Trump’s dismay. Trump called Powell a “fool” and Thursday likened speaking with the central banker like “talking to a wall.”

Title: Mark Zuckerberg announces mind-control

Pluralistic: Daily links from Cory Doctorow No trackers, no ads. Black type, white background. Privacy policy: we don't collect or retain any data at all ever period. Mark Zuckerberg has told investors how he plans to make back the tens of billions he's spending on AI: he's going to use it to make advertisements that can bypass our critical faculties and convince anyone to buy anything. In other words, Meta will make an AI mind-control ray and rent it out to grateful advertisers. Here, Zuck is fulfilling the fundamental duty of every CEO of every high-growth tech company: explaining how his company will continue to grow. These growth stories are key, because growth stocks trade at a huge premium relative to the stocks of "mature" companies. Every dollar Meta brings in boosts their share price to a much greater degree than the dollars earned by companies with similar rates of profit, but slower rates of growth. This premium represents a bet by investors that Meta will continue to grow, which means that the instant Meta stops growing, the value of its shares will plummet, to reflect the fact that it is a "mature" company, not a "growth" company. So Zuck needs to do everything he can to keep investors believing that Meta will continue to grow. After all, Zuck's key employees and top managers all take much (or even most!) of their compensation in Meta stock, which means that the instant the company stops growing, those workers' pay will plummet and they will seek employment elsewhere, depriving Meta of the workers it needs to successfully create or conquer a new market and once again become a growth stock. This is why Zuck keeps telling stories. The most important story Zuck tells is about himself, the boy genius who converted a tool for nonconsensually rating the fuckability of Harvard undergrads into a social media monopoly with four billion users. Zuck's cult of personality isn't the product of mere narcissism – it's a tool for creating the material conditions for ongoing investor confidence: https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-shirt-latin-what-does-it-say-explained-words-2024-9 If Zuck is a boy genius, then Zuck's pronouncements take on the character of prophesy. When Zuck announced the "pivot to video," investors poured tens of billions into Facebook stock and into video-first online news production, despite the fact that Zuck was obviously lying: https://slate.com/technology/2018/10/facebook-online-video-pivot-metrics-false.html The "boy genius" story is an example of Silicon Valley's storied "reality distortion field," pioneered by Steve Jobs. Like Jobs, Zuck is a Texas marksman, who fires a shotgun into the side of a barn and then draws a target around the holes. Jobs is remembered for his successes, and forgiven his (many, many) flops, and so is Zuck. The fact that pivot to video was well understood to have been a catastrophic scam didn't stop people from believing Zuck when he announced "metaverse." Zuck lost more than $70b on metaverse, but, being a boy genius Texas marksman, he is still able to inspire confidence from credulous investors. Zuck's AI initiatives generated huge interest in Meta's stock, with investors betting that Zuck would find ways to keep Meta's growth going, despite the fact that AI has the worst unit economics of any tech venture in living memory. AI is a business that gets more expensive as time goes on, and where the market's willingness to pay goes down over time. This makes the old dotcom economics of "losing money on every sale, but making it up in volume" look positively rosy: https://www.wheresyoured.at/reality-check/ Now, Zuck has finally described how he's going to turn AI's terrible economics around: he's going to ask AI to design his advertisers' campaigns, and these will be so devastatingly effective that advertisers will pay a huge premium to advertise on Meta: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-ai-revolution-is-an-advertising-revolution-morning-brief-100001467.html This narrative is especially galling because it's literally the same story Zuck has been telling for decades: "Facebook has built a mind-control ray out of Big Data, and we can sell anything to anyone": https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/30/dont-believe-the-criti-hype/#ordinary-mediocrities This is a facially absurd proposition. After all, everyone who's ever claimed to have perfected mind-control – Rasputin, Mesmer, MK-ULTRA, neurolinguistic programming grifters and pathetic "pick up artists" – was a liar. Either they were lying to themselves, or to everyone else. Or both. But many of tech's critics helped sell this narrative (and thus helped Meta sell ads). Many critics have fallen prey to the sin of "criti-hype," Lee Vinsel's term for critiquing the claims of your adversary without bothering to ask whether they are true: https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/02/euthanize-rentiers/#dont-believe-the-hype The project of convincing investors that tech's "dopamine hackers" had perfected mind-control with warmed over, non-replicable Skinnerian behavior-mod techniques and mass surveillance sold a hell of a lot of ads. After all, if there's one kind of person the advertising sector has always been able to sell to, it's advertising executives, who are the easiest of marks for a story about how easy it is to trick the public into buying whatever you're selling: https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#wannamakers-ghost Every ad-tech sales-bro who takes a meeting with an advertising executive finds himself pushing on an open door. Advertisers desperately wants to believe in mind-control rays. Think of the department store magnate John Wannamaker, who said, "half my advertising spending is wasted – I just don't know which half." Imagine: some advertising exec convinced John Wannamaker that he was only wasting half of his advertising spending! I've long maintained that the threat from AI to workers isn't that AI can do your job – it's that an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with an AI that can't do your job: https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/18/asbestos-in-the-walls/#government-by-spicy-autocomplete The corollary here is that it doesn't matter if AI can design ads that work, not so long as an AI ad salesman can sell this proposition to advertisers, and not so long as a tech CEO can sell it to investors. AI keeps passing the worst kinds of Turing tests – for example, it's great at convincing people who are prone to life-destroying hallucinations that they are talking to God: https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ai-spiritual-delusions-destroying-human-relationships-1235330175/ Zuck kept up his growth story with this mind control narrative for more than a decade, got caught committing a string of spectacular frauds, and then lured investors back into his stock offerings by telling the same story. This isn't just an indictment of Zuck, it's a stinging rebuke to the whole idea that markets are a kind of infallible computer for assessing and operationalizing information. The market's "thought process" demonstrably lacks the object permanence that most babies acquire by the time they are a year old. You can tell when your child has acquired object permanence by the fact that they cease to enjoy "peek-a-boo" (object permanence means they understand where you have gone when your face is hidden). In claiming that AI will give him an infinite growth mind-control ray, Mark Zuckerberg is challenging the market to a game of peek-a-boo – and he's winning.

Title: AI engines are starting to challenge Google's search dominance

Happy almost Friday! Some good news this morning: A cheap, widely-prescribed diabetes drug is showing some promise in preventing colon cancer. In today's big story, Google's stock tanked after an Apple exec said AI engines are starting to challenge the search engine's dominance. If you haven't subscribed to our new newsletter Tech Memo, what are you waiting for? What's on deck Markets: Trump teases first 'major trade deal' — and it's set to be with the UK. Tech: Big Tech is all about rewarding its stars and getting rid of everyone else. Business: People are fed up with companies' 'bait and switch pricing.' But first, can you Google ChatGPT this? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. AI giveth, and AI taketh. Google seems to be learning that the hard way, as the new tech is gaining ground on one of its crown jewels. Apple executive Eddy Cue said searches on its Safari browser shrank for the first time last month, and he's pointing the finger at AI engines, writes BI's Peter Kafka. Cue also said AI tools like OpenAI and Perplexity AI would eventually supplant traditional search engines, and Apple will offer them to Safari users in the future. Google investors took the news hard, with shares dropping more than 8% on Wednesday. Cue has a vested interest in Google's search business, since Google pays Apple at least $20 billion a year to make its search engine the default on the iPhone. Still, in theory, Apple might be able to replace some or all of that money with payments from the OpenAIs of the world. (Cue's comments came while testifying in the federal antitrust suit against Google's parent company, Alphabet. When it rains, it pours.) The AI boom obviously hasn't been all bad for Google. The interest in the tech gave it the green light to invest billions in new development. The results weren't always great, but it largely seems happy with the progress made on things like its AI Overviews. But as much as it tries to reshape itself, the progress made by its younger, smaller AI rivals is becoming undeniable. It's not just the new kids on the block enjoying the AI revolution. A very, very old player has newfound success leveraging AI. IBM is full speed ahead on its AI strategy, and Wall Street is eating it up, writes BI's Matthew Fox. The company's stock is up almost 15% this year, far outpacing the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, which is down 5%. At its recent conference, CEO Arvind Krishna said its generative AI business is now worth $6 billion. IBM's focus is helping companies adopt AI, and has the added benefit of an open-source approach. That allows it to work with clients regardless of the AI tools they prefer, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Matthew. (If you're looking for more tech coverage like this, subscribe to our upcoming tech newsletter Tech Memo. Alistair Barr will be running the show, and he does a much better job of covering tech than me.) 1. Trump's first post-tariffs trade deal. The White House is expected to announce a trade deal with the UK on Thursday. A Downing Street spokeswoman told BI that talks between the two countries had been "continuing at pace" and the Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, would provide an update later on Thursday. 2. No surprises from the Fed. The central bank held interest rates steady as expected, although Chairman Jerome Powell had faced calls from President Trump and members of his administration to lower them. Powell has stressed waiting to see how tariffs affect the economy. 3. Jefferies banker's death ruled an accident. Carter McIntosh, a 28-year-old associate, died of a toxic mix of drugs including fentanyl and cocaine, an autopsy revealed. His death in January sparked widespread backlash against the bank's work culture. 1. Big Tech has a new playbook. Tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are doubling down on performance-based rewards, with top performers receiving larger payouts and low performers facing the heat. Meanwhile, new-hire offers are being reduced. 2. How a meme empire is sliding into your DMs. The Instagram gold rush isn't in the grid anymore — it's in your DMs. Doing Things, the company that owns meme accounts like Overheard, told BI its strategy to get users to share its content. 3. Meet Valarian, a new addition from the Palantir mafia. The Palantir-alumni-founded startup wants to help governments and companies control their data and has plans to expand into the defense sector. Its current seed round has raised $20 million. 1. Pro-Tesla, anti-Musk. Working for Tesla was Matthew LaBrot's dream job, but he was fired after publishing a website protesting Elon Musk. In an interview with BI, he shared his concern for how the billionaire is affecting Tesla's brand and sales — and why he still believes in the company anyway. 2. Recession fears got nothing on Disney adults. They know a Disney vacation is pricey, but they're going anyway. Disney World visits are surging, US parks revenue soared last quarter, and soon, they'll have a new magical destination to add to the list: Abu Dhabi. 3. Does $19.95 to rent a U-Haul truck sound too good to be true? That's because it is. Companies are using "bait-and-switch" tactics to lure customers in with one price, only to tack on extra fees and make the total nowhere near what was initially expected. It's so common that customers often throw their hands up and pay anyway. Paramount, News Corp, Coinbase, and Lyft report earnings.

Title: What’s Happening With Arista Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. INDIA - 2023/12/14: In this photo illustration, the Arista Networks Inc. logo seen displayed on a ... More mobile phone screen with the AI (artificial intelligence) revolution symbol in the background. (Photo Illustration by Idrees Abbas/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Despite posting impressive quarterly results, Arista Networks (NASDAQ: ANET) saw an unexpected market reaction. The company delivered solid numbers with sales reaching $2.0 billion (up 27.6% year-over-year) and adjusted earnings of $0.65 per share (up from $0.50 last year). Both figures beat Wall Street expectations of $1.97 billion in sales and $0.59 EPS. As an aside, will Tesla get back to basics? See Tesla’s Lost Cause. Adding to the good news, Arista’s Q2 outlook of $2.1 billion exceeded consensus estimates, and they announced a $1.5 billion share buyback program. Normally, these would be ingredients for a stock rally, but instead, ANET dropped 5% in after-hours trading. Clearly, ANET stock is volatile, and if you are looking for potential upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and delivered returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – What’s Next For HIMS Stock After A Solid Q1? So what happened? Investors were clearly hoping for even more, especially considering major tech companies have maintained their AI-related capital expenditure plans. The question now: Does it make sense to buy ANET at $86 (after-hours price)? We think absolutely. At $86 (after market), ANET trades at 15x trailing revenues, just slightly above its three-year average P/S ratio of 14x. We believe a higher valuation multiple is justified given Arista’s strong position in the AI space, with companies like Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, and Google making up a significant portion of sales while remaining committed to AI expansion. With sales growth projected in the high teens over the next few years, the premium valuation makes sense. Bottom line: Investors should consider using this dip in ANET stock as an opportunity to buy for solid long-term gains. For investors aiming to reduce the inherent volatility associated with individual stocks like Arista Networks, there are alternative investment strategies available. The Trefis RV strategy, which has a history of outperforming its all-cap stock benchmark, provides a diversified approach to potentially achieve solid returns. Likewise, the High-Quality portfolio has shown superior performance compared to the S&P 500 with returns that exceed 91% since its initiation, offering potential upside with reduced stock-specific risk.

Title: Facebook stole my book to train its AI. The insult wasn't the money
URL: https://qz.com/meta-facebook-ai-mark-zuckerberg-books-llama-theft-1851779221
Time Published: 2025-05-07T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
It started with an email from my literary agent. “You might’ve heard about LibGen and books being used to train AI,” she wrote. “A search of the database shows that Poe for Your Problems is on the list.” I had seen the headline, back in March, in The Atlantic: “Meta (META) pirated millions of books to train its AI,” it screamed. But to my shame, I hadn’t actually read the piece. I had been too busy writing for Quartz (as now) and chasing my four-year-old around the house. Life goes on, even when someone steals your intellectual property. Yet there it was. The story detailed how Meta employees had downloaded tens of gigabytes of pirated books from LibGen, a well-known “shadow library” that hosts roughly eight million titles. They used these files to help train LLaMA 3, the company’s most advanced language model. Internal discussions, unsealed earlier this year as part of an ongoing lawsuit, show that Meta’s engineers explicitly debated the legal risks and chose to proceed anyway, looking to save both time and money. The documents further suggest that top leadership signed off on the maneuver. “Eventually, the team at Meta got permission from ‘MZ’ — an apparent reference to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — to download and use the data set,” The Atlantic reported. In response, a group of authors including Sarah Silverman have filed a class action lawsuit, now winding its way through the legal system. Instead, I was relieved. My little book had been deemed important enough to steal! Thank goodness. The greater shame would’ve been not being pirated, considering the scale of the theft. I turned to a friend who happened to be standing nearby and said, “It’s just nice to be included.” If that seems like a perverse reaction, well, it conveys how humbling it can be to achieve your lifelong author dreams. Many people dream of publishing a book someday — I had since I was eight years old — but becoming an author is a lesson in humility, at least in my experience. You show up at a bookstore to give a reading to five people, two of whom are your dad’s cousins. You do podcast interviews in which the host greets you with, “So I haven’t had time to read your book… can you remind me what it’s about and who you are?” Like I said: humbling. But the relief quickly curdled as I remembered what it had been like to sell the book in the first place. Nonfiction is sold on proposal — which means you don’t write the book, you write a 40-page business plan for the book. I spent years on mine, rewriting it three separate times. I got upwards of two dozen rejections before it finally went to auction and found a home with a Hachette subsidiary in 2019. After that, it took another year to write the actual book. When it came out in 2021, I spent thousands of hours promoting it. My advance was $20,000 — not nothing. But that was before taxes and my agent’s 15% cut. I once calculated that I’d earned less than the federal minimum wage for writing the book. Since it “earned out” in 2023 (meaning the publisher fully made back its costs), I’ve received another $10,000 in royalties. Those checks are always welcome, but they’re also pre-tax couch change compared to the time, energy, and ambition that went into the work. It’s hard to explain just how difficult it is to land a publishing deal, especially with one of the “Big Four.” Unless you’re an Obama or a Kardashian, it’s nearly impossible. Publishing is a perpetually precarious industry, surviving year to year on breakout hits like Atomic Habits or It Ends With Us. Even the largest publishers operate on net margins of about 6%. That doesn’t leave much room for risk. So they’re understandably reluctant to bet on an unproven author with an odd idea. I got around the issue of not being famous myself by writing about someone who was: my literary hero, Edgar Allan Poe. But that didn’t make things easy. Selling a self-help book based on the life of history’s most miserable writer was, perhaps unsurprisingly, an uphill battle. And while my genre — irreverent self-help, sometimes called “anti-self-help” — is relatively common now, it wasn’t when I was knocking on doors, metaphorical hat in hand. Putting together a convincing business case was hard enough. Writing the actual book — 55,000 words of deeply researched, counterintuitive argument — was harder still. “To coin one’s brain into silver, at the nod of a master, is to my thinking, the hardest task in the world,” Poe once wrote. It’s no less true when you’re the master, too. Today, Amazon sells my book for $12.99. My cut of that is $2.25. And that’s too steep a price tag for Meta? A company worth $1.5 trillion, helmed by a founder with a $200 billion net worth? Mark Zuckerberg owns about 13% of Meta stock. He could’ve paid me $2.25 — the amount I earn per sale — almost 89 billion times. Or he could’ve just bought a single copy, which would’ve cost him 0.0000011% of his wealth. Assuming a $20 sticker price on each of the 7.5 million pirated books, actually paying for all of them would’ve cost about $150 million — not even one-tenth of one percent of Zuckerberg’s fortune. Me? I would’ve come out $2.25 better. I could’ve bought a Snickers, depending on the gas station. Surely the world’s third-richest man could swing that. If you want to understand the artist’s dilemma in the AI age, it’s this: Do something singular, something that takes years of obsessive creative labor — then watch it get stolen by someone for whom $150 million is a rounding error. In that light, it’s not just theft. It’s bullying. Exploitation. Looting on a grand scale. The stuff of Upton Sinclair. Only we don’t have robber barons anymore. We have pirate captains. Bluebeards of the human heart. And what are we supposed to fight them with? Carefully worded emails? That’s like bringing a spork to a nuclear war. Some authors think publishers should be the ones leading the charge. “I checked one of the sites,” the novelist Domenica Ruta told me, “and yes, both my former books were used to train AI. I’m furious and feel utterly powerless about what to do. My take is that publishers — who absolutely have the resources — need to be the frontline defenders against this. They need to protect their authors and our work. As individuals we have little power. A Big Four publisher has a lot more influence.” When Facebook came to power and popularity circa 2010, we at least understood the bargain: In exchange for our data, we got to post above-average-cute photos of ourselves, and learn our relatives’ reprehensible political views. The calculation has shifted since, with Meta stealing something much more intimate, deeply personal, and hard-won than data. If I’d plagiarized someone’s book, I’d be in trouble. I’d go to court, face consequences, quite likely be publicly shamed. That’s not what’s happening to Zuckerberg. Instead, he hangs out at the White House. If you walked into Barnes & Noble and stole a $13 book, you’d get the police called on you. But steal 7.5 million, and you’ll make billions. It’s an object lesson in contemporary law enforcement: the bigger the crime, the more likely you are to get away with it. By the same token, shoplift some disposable razors and you’re a menace, a criminal. Steal 7.5 million books and you’re a visionary. That’s the math now. People love to obsess about thefts of toothpaste and Tide Pods at CVS (CVS) in San Francisco, but plunder on an epic scale just slightly further south and you’ll not only walk away untouched, you’ll emerge vastly richer. It’s hard to think this wasn’t Meta’s whole calculus to begin with. Gamble big, make billions, and let the lawsuits drag on. A lawyer friend of mine put it plainly: The copyright cases are about to enter discovery in both New York and California, and Meta is likely to lose. But by then, the damage will be done. As they said, “No one loves to read more than lawyers and judges.” In the meantime, the industry is already eyeing a workaround by lobbying the executive branch directly. Here’s the part I really hate to say: I don’t think they can be stopped either, whatever the class action lawsuit does. Facebook has faced down governments. It’s currently facing down the FTC and the European Union. And beyond Facebook, vast as it is, there’s the whole AI wave we’re all riding, if unequally. Companies like Meta, Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) are likely to reap long-term trillions by creating AI tools and programs. I’ve covered the stock market for more than a decade and I’ve never seen economic logic so relentless. Meanwhile, artists and white-collar workers are losing their livelihoods on top of the knowledge and ingenuity that’s already been stolen from them. To coin one’s brain into silver — and watch it be scraped by AI — is enough to make you question the point of doing it in the first place. Lest I seem knee-jerk anti-capitalist, I should add that I come at all this as an author and a shareholder. Checking my Etrade (MS) just now, I see I own about $31,000 in Meta stock. That’s in a regular, non-retirement brokerage account and doesn’t include shares I own indirectly through index and mutual funds. I started buying the stock circa the IPO because I’ve long recognized the wealth-creation dynamics of our era: Hard work may or may not pay off, but invest in companies like Meta and you can ride along for the extra-legal wealth they’re likely to create. It’s the surer thing. So I don’t begrudge Meta its $16.4 billion quarterly profit, not necessarily. But as a shareholder, I don’t want it earned through theft. And as a writer, I feel the same way. You want so badly to enter the cultural DNA. But if it means you get erased, robbed, exploited? Not so much. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: U.S. stocks drop on concerns over trade tensions

Wednesday, 07 May 2025 NEW YORK, May 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks closed lower on Tuesday as investors sifted through a wave of corporate earnings while looking ahead to developments on trade talks and the outcome of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting, which began earlier in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 389.83 points, or 0.95 percent, to 40,829.00. The S&P 500 dropped 43.47 points, or 0.77 percent, to 5,606.91, while the Nasdaq Composite Index slid 154.58 points, or 0.87 percent, to finish at 17,689.66. Nine of the eleven S&P 500 sectors ended in negative territory, led by healthcare and consumer discretionary, which declined 2.76 percent and 0.85 percent, respectively. Utilities and energy were the only sectors to post gains, up 1.23 percent and 0.10 percent. Stocks seesawed on Tuesday following a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, their first formal negotiation session since Carney recently took office. During the meeting, Trump dialed back earlier optimism about impending trade agreements, stating bluntly, "We don't have to sign deals." The remark marked a sharp reversal from his Sunday comments, when he suggested multiple deals could be finalized as soon as this week. Investors are now turning their attention to the Federal Reserve, which is not expected to change its benchmark interest rate this week. However, markets are eagerly awaiting Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks on Wednesday, particularly his views on how the Trump administration's tariff policies may be influencing the broader economic outlook. "Despite external pressure to lower rates, the Fed will likely hold strong on the current pause until we see greater clarity on the major economic factors impacting the economy," said Steve Rick, chief economist at TruStage. "As the impacts of tariffs settle in, we still broadly expect the economy to continue to shift towards a slower pace of growth than in recent months." Earnings reports drove notable stock movements on Tuesday. Palantir plunged 12.05 percent, making it the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, despite meeting first-quarter earnings expectations and providing a positive forecast. In contrast, Constellation Energy surged 10.29 percent after beating revenue estimates, fueled by rising electricity demand linked to AI infrastructure growth. Ford Motor gained 2.65 percent after surpassing quarterly profit estimates, though it withdrew its full-year guidance due to tariff-related uncertainty. Mattel also climbed 2.78 percent as it suspended its outlook and announced price hikes in response to tariffs. Large-cap tech stocks, which had recently driven much of the market's rally, faced selling pressure. Tesla and Meta Platforms both declined by about 2 percent, while Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Broadcom, Apple and Nvidia also lost ground. Thank you for your report!

Title: The 7 Best Diaper Bags, According To Moms Who’ve Tested Over 20 Styles

Before I had my first baby, I don’t think I truly understood how many things I would need to carry around with them whenever we left the house. The best diaper bags have the space to stow all those baby essentials like wipes, diapers, bottles, spare clothes, burp cloths and toys. They’re also comfortable and easy for parents to use, so you’re not digging through the diaper bag abyss to find that elusive pacifier. After testing over 20 diaper bags among several testers, we found the Petunia Pickle Bottom Meta Backpack to be the best—it’s made of high-quality materials and has dedicated pockets for all the essentials. Our top value pick, the popular Skip Hop Forma Diaper Bag Backpack, is lightweight, roomy and has remained durable through years of testing. The best diaper bags hold and organize everything you need for your little. Here are all of our winners after testing over 20 diaper bags: When choosing a diaper bag, consider the size and style you want. If you have multiple kids, you may need a larger bag—but be careful not to overload it. Additionally, many parents prefer a backpack or belt bag, so they can have their hands free. “A comfortable, well-designed and ergonomic diaper bag that meets your specific needs can improve quality of life as you navigate the daily demands of motherhood,” says Amy McCormick, an occupational therapist who leads the postpartum rehabilitation program at UNC Rex Holly Springs Hospital in North Carolina. Continue reading for an in-depth look at all of our top picks for the best diaper bags along with more information on our testing process and what to look for when you’re shopping for a diaper bag. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 13.4 x 6.7 x 13.8 inches | Weight: 1.3 pounds | Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: A 100% guarantee on hardware and fabric defects for two years | Cleaning instructions: Wipe down Best for: Skip if: With 10 total pockets, the Petunia Pickle Bottom Meta Backpack makes it simple to find a spot for all your baby items and then some. From a discreet felt-lined electronics pocket to stretchy diaper pockets and an insulated bottle pocket, there’s a place to put everything. The large main compartment zippers all the way down, which helps with packing the bag and finding things that may have fallen to the bottom. A strap on the back that attaches to rolling luggage makes it a great option for travel, too. It’s also the lightest diaper bag backpack that we tested. The Petunia Pickle Bottom Meta Backpack is just the right size for essentials. Many of the more stylish diaper bags I’ve tested are either uncomfortable or have fabrics that are difficult to maintain and clean. That isn’t the case with this bag. Depending on the style you choose, the outer material is either vegan leather, coated canvas or vegan leather with cable-stitch textured embossing. The styles are classic and professional, making this a good option to bring to work if you’re pumping or simply want to continue to use the bag after your baby is older. Though the bag isn’t machine washable, the materials are easy to wipe clean. Our tester intentionally spilled a blueberry pouch on the bag and left it to sit overnight. In the morning, it wiped up effortlessly. The included changing pad is machine washable, so there’s no need to worry about messy diaper changes. The comfort of this bag is a huge plus, too. It’s a backpack-style bag, which many of our experts recommend. The padded straps are nice and comfortable. “When worn properly, with both straps well positioned, [backpack bags] can help minimize risk of injury and reduce stress on the back, abdominals, and pelvic floor,” says McCormick., Though I laud the bag for its ample pockets, you can’t pack quite as much in this bag as some of our other top picks, like the Skip Hop Forma or the Béis Backpack Diaper Bag. When I try to put too many things in the bag, it becomes lumpy and awkward because there isn’t much give to the material. Our tester also found that the side water bottle pocket was difficult to pack when there were too many things in the main compartment. However, that limit on space is a good thing in some ways. “More space just means more stuff crammed inside—and trust us, you don’t need to carry everything but the kitchen sink,” says Laura Hunter, a licensed practical nurse and cofounder of Moms on Call, a parenting resource brand. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 16 x 8 x 14 inches | Weight: 1.4 pounds | Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: Limited warranty | Cleaning instructions: Wipe down Best for: Skip if: The value of the Skip Hop Forma Diaper Bag Backpack is unmatched. My husband and I have used it as our main diaper bag for over five years, and it’s still in excellent shape. The bag has two padded straps and it’s a backpack bag, making it the ideal ergonomic option. Because it’s a backpack bag that’s incredibly lightweight, this is a good option for parents have back problems or moms who may struggle with core strength, pelvic floor strength or who are recovering from a c-section or tear. “Postpartum moms should consider their core and pelvic health when choosing a diaper bag. After a vaginal birth, weakened pelvic floor muscles and potential back pain mean a lightweight, evenly distributed bag (like a backpack style) is ideal to reduce strain. For c-section recovery, avoiding heavy shoulder bags that put pressure on healing abdominal muscles is crucial,” says John Gallucci Jr., a doctor of physical therapy and CEO of New York-based Jag Physical Therapy. The Skip Hop Forma is a great value option that's durable and easy to pack. I like packing this bag more than some of the more stylish or boxy bags because the material has some give to it. There are nine total pockets, plus two packing cubes. Pockets include two bottle pockets, a main compartment, two stretchy interior pockets, two front zipper pockets and more. The bag also comes with a changing pad. The side bottle pockets have plenty of room to hold water bottles for parents and caregivers or babies. The storage cubes are great for packing things on-the-go, too. If I want to leave the larger diaper bag in the car, I can put a bottle, diaper and some wipes in a packing cube and significantly lighten my load. McCormick likes the option of using removable storage cubes, too, as they make it easy to add and remove items based on the specific outing or activity. The fabric is water-repellent, and our tester found it easy to clean a spilled baby food pouch and water. In addition to being able to wipe down any spills, I’ve also found that it’s easy to clean out crumbs and messes at the bottom of the bag because the fabric has enough flexibility to it that I can turn the bag inside out. Dagne Dover Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 9.5 x 5.6 x 12.3 inches (small), 11.8 x 6.5 x 12.8 inches (medium, 12.3 x 7 x 13.8 (large) | Weight: 3 pounds (small), 3.5 pounds (medium), 4 pounds (large)| Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: Limited guarantee for 1 year | Cleaning instructions: Hand wash Best for: Skip if: The Dagne Dover Indi Diaper Backpack comes in small, medium and large sizes, so parents can find the right option for their carrying style. In addition to the many interior and exterior pockets, including a wipes and insulated bottle holder, it also comes with extras like a storage pouch and a shoe bag. A luggage sleeve on the back makes this a good option for travel, too. Other extras include a changing mat and stroller clips, though we don’t recommend using stroller clips due to the potential danger of tipping the stroller. If you tend to overpack your bag, you might want to get the size larger than you think you’ll need. Our tester found that when she had the main compartment of the bag packed full, it was difficult to use the exterior zipper pockets. The fabric on the Dagne Dover Indi is so comfortable and soft. Many people love the look and feel of the Indi. The neoprene material is 100% vegan, and it’s available in a variety of aesthetic colors, some of which are gender-neutral. From the outside, it looks more like a regular backpack than a diaper bag. The fabric is soft, not stiff, and the nicely padded straps make it comfortable to wear. Our tester found that the fabric stretches easily to accommodate items that you throw in the bag. If you (or your kids) tend to spill things a lot, this may not be the best bag for you. When our tester spilled water and a tot food pouch on the bag, it initially cleaned up well, but in the long-term, she found some stains lingered on her camel-colored bag. Béis Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 12 x 7.75 x 15 inches | Weight: 4 pounds | Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: 45-day return policy | Cleaning instructions: Wipe down Best for: Skip if: Some people like to overstuff their diaper bag (guilty as charged). Whether you’re packing for twins like me or just need extra space, the Béis Backpack Diaper Bag gives you the room you need. The top of the bag opens wide so you can pack and find the things you need, and there are a good number of pockets. Our tester found that the exterior bottle pockets were large enough to hold her water bottles, which wasn’t the case with every bag she tested. Inside, you can tighten the insulated bottle pouch so your baby’s bottle doesn’t get lost in the main compartment. Because it’s such a big bag and it already weighs 4 pounds, be careful not to overpack it. “Extremely large or heavy bags may encourage overpacking, making it hard to reach items and adding unnecessary strain to the back, abdominals and pelvic floor,” says McCormick. Though the bag can get heavy if you stuff too much in it, our tester found it comfortable with nicely padded straps. My favorite thing about the Béis Backpack Diaper Bag is that it’s obvious it was thoroughly designed with babies and parents in mind. The included changing pad has a pouch to store diapers, wipes or diaper rash cream. In the bag, you’ll find a pacifier pouch and a teething ring. There is also an odor-proof pouch, which is ideal for storing soiled clothes or for parents who use cloth diapers to store dirty diapers until they get home. Another included extra is stroller clips, though we do not recommend using these as the weight of the bag can tip your stroller. Our tester loved all of these extras as well as how easy the bag is to clean. The stain-resistant fabric can be wiped down. She had no problem cleaning up the food pouch that she intentionally spilled on the bag. The high-quality and easy-to-clean material makes this a great pick for families with multiple kids or those who want a durable bag that can stand up to extensive everyday use. Caraa Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 12.3 x 12 x 5 inches (medium), 13 x 12.8 x 5.8 (large) | Weight: 2.5 pounds (medium), 3 pounds (large) | Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: 21 day return period, manufacturing defects are assessed on a case by case basis | Cleaning instructions: Machine washable (black), clean with mild neutral soap mixed with warm water and a clean microfiber cloth (all other colors) Best for: Skip if: Becoming a parent doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice your style or your love for luxury products. The Caraa Baby Bag is made with parent and baby in mind, with so many thoughtful features. Forbes Vetted editor Margaret Badore found that this bag had the best features of all the high-end bags she tested. She particularly likes the hot/cold pocket and the fully removable diaper caddy. The caddy has four pockets for storing wipes, diapers and other essentials, and it’s a helpful feature for packing a few things on the go. “The removable organizer is also extremely useful; when packed with diaper change essentials, I could take just that part out and head to the bathroom with baby for a change,” says Badore. Unfortunately, the bag does not come with a changing pad to complement the diaper caddy. One of my favorite baby-friendly features: the black version of the bag is machine washable, which isn’t a common feature in diaper bags. No matter the spill, you can throw it in the wash for quick cleanup. For other color options, you need to clean with mild neutral soap mixed with warm water and a clean microfiber cloth to maintain the color. The Caraa Baby Bag can be worn as a backpack or a cross-body bag. The bag is available in a medium or large size, and the versatility is key. You can choose to wear the bag as a backpack or as a crossbody bag by attaching a shoulder strap. When you wear it this way, you can tuck the backpack straps out of the way. The bag also comes with stroller hooks, but we don’t recommend using them because hanging a bag on your stroller can cause it to tip. This bag has so many pockets. From insulated bottle pockets to a phone pocket to hot/cold pockets and pockets with magnetic closures, you’ll certainly find a spot to put everything. When you’re traveling, simply slide the bag onto your luggage with the attached luggage sleeve. Badore has used this bag for about two years, including on family trips and as a carry-on, and has found virtually no signs of wear. The profile of this bag is a bit wider than many others, so that’s something to consider if you need your bag to fit into a compact area. State Bags Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 16.5 x 13 x 5.9 inches | Weight: 1.9 pounds | Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: 1 year for material or manufacturing defects | Cleaning instructions: Spot clean with a damp cloth Best for: Skip if: A gender neutral diaper bag is ideal if you’ll be sharing the bag with other caregivers—or perhaps you simply prefer that look and style. From the outside, the State Lorimer Diaper Bag doesn’t scream diaper bag, and it’s available in five colors, including the several gender-neutral picks like an olive, black and navy. You can personalize the bag with up to three characters and two symbols or patches. The padded straps are nice, and Badore found the bag comfortable even when it was loaded up. When traveling, you can also attach the bag to your luggage with a built-in luggage slip. The fabric is easy to clean. In our tests, water ran right off the nylon parts, and our spilled pouch wiped up no problem. Badore appreciates all of the pockets in this bag, which include two main compartments, a front zipper pocket, side water bottle pockets, an insulated bottle pocket and more. With so many places to put things, it’s less likely you’ll lose something at the bottom of the bag. It also includes a washable changing pad and a padded laptop sleeve that fits laptops up to 15 inches. For parents who sometimes have to work while taking care of their kids, this can be a huge plus. Though there is plenty of room for all of the essentials, the large size of this bag could encourage you to pack too much, which could put extra stain on your back. This can also be dangerous if you use the attached stroller clips as a heavy diaper bag could tip a stroller. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 6.5 x 7 x 4 inches | Weight: 2 pounds | Bag style: Belt bag | Warranty: Limited warranty for 1 year | Cleaning instructions: Machine washable Best for: Skip if: I really couldn’t ask for much more in a compact diaper bag. The Colugo On-The-Go Organizer is sleek, comfortable and highly adjustable. According to Hunter, small and compact is the way to go. “Moms on Call recommends smaller, well-organized bags that keep only the essentials at your fingertips. Some other features we can do without,” she says. The bag has enough room for the basics like diapers and wipes. It has six pockets plus two bottle holders, so you can keep your items organized, too. Our tester was surprised at how many things she could fit in the bag. It also had room for her son’s sweatshirt. The Colugo On The Go Organizer is ideal for staying hands-free while carrying all the essentials. My favorite thing about this bag is that it can double as a stroller organizer. While hanging larger, heavier bags from a stroller is unsafe due to the potential for tipping, I don’t worry about that with such a small bag. In fact, the bag is designed to be a stroller organizer first, diaper bag second. It’s nice to be able to just grab the bag and go when you need to park your stroller or leave it somewhere unattended. The versatility makes the price just right, too. You’re getting two products in one. I appreciate machine-washable diaper bags like this one, because with three kids, sometimes I don’t realize a spill happened until well after the fact. It wipes down easily, too. Our tester spilled the majority of a water bottle in the bag and found that it dried easily and didn’t get things stored in other pockets wet. The bag is simple to adjust and comfortable. I don’t have to fiddle with the straps too much to get them where I want them. Other crossbody or belt bags that I’ve tested feel too boxy or bulky, but I didn’t find that with this one. The strap also has a pretty wide range, meaning it can work for caregivers of various sizes. Over several years, we’ve tested more than 20 diaper bags among three mom testers. We included our favorites in the guide and continue to test additional bags as they become available. Here are the others we’ve tested: Freshly Picked Classic Diaper Bag: I’ve had this bag for years, and I really like the style and look of it. However, it’s pretty boxy, and it doesn’t offer as many organization options as other bags. Another tester also found that it started to fray almost immediately, which made us question the high price tag. BabbleRoo Diaper Bag Backpack: This is a budget-friendly diaper bag that is available in many colors and styles. It also has a lot of useful pockets, like a pacifier pouch and three insulated bottle pockets. It wasn’t as comfortable as some of the other bags we tested, and our tester found it difficult to pack the bag with everything she needed. Ruvalino Diaper Bag Backpack: This popular bag is well-loved for its low price. However, it’s somewhat bulky and stiff. It was also a bit more difficult to clean than many other bags we tested. We enjoyed the variety of pockets and were able to pack a lot into the bag. Herschel Baby Strand Sprout Shoulder Bag: Though this is more of a minimalistic bag, there is plenty of space inside. Our tester really liked the included changing pad. Unfortunately, it lacks many of the features of our top picks and our tester wasn’t able to find a comfortable way to carry the bag. Eddie Bauer Cascade Back Pack Diaper Bag: There are plenty of features packed into this diaper bag like a wipes pocket, insulated bottle pocket and changing pad. However, it’s not as user-friendly as we’d like. It can be difficult to reach the bottom of the main compartment and our tester found that the diaper pockets weren’t wide enough. Béis The Diaper Pack: This bag has some nice features like a changing pad and a convenient wipes pocket. It’s also pretty spacious for a belt bag. However, I found it too boxy and bulky. The main dealbreaker was that when worn as a belt bag, I couldn’t get the straps small enough. Parents and caregivers with slim frames may struggle to get the bag tight enough to stay on. Dagne Dover Ace: Those searching for something extra minimalistic might like this fanny pack diaper bag—but it just didn’t have enough features or space for us. Storq Quick Change Fanny Pack : Though this bag is a good size for a belt bag, it doesn’t have the organization features necessary to store the amount of baby gear you can fit in a bag. We like that it’s lightweight and machine washable. Ditty Co. Small Diaper Bag: This belt bag is comfortable and machine washable with an affordable price that matches it size. It might work for some families who prefer to pack light, but we wanted more space. Luli Baby Monaco Sling Bag: This sling bag has nice features given its smaller package, such as a pacifier holder and a phone pocket. It’s more complicated to adjust and get items out of than other bags we tested, though, and when you’re juggling babies and all their things, you don’t want a bag that makes things more difficult. State Jordan Diaper Bag: We were able to fit plenty of things in this bag and liked the organizing pouches and changing pad. However, we didn’t find the shoulder strap very comfortable, especially when compared to backpack style diaper bags. BagSmart Walker 25L Featherlight Travel Diaper Backpack: There are a lot of features in this bag that we appreciated, like the large insulated bottle pocket and the waterproof laundry pouch. What our tester didn’t like was that many of these features don’t quite work the way they should. For example, the insulated bottle pouch didn’t fit many popular bottle brands, and it was hard to get diapers to fit into the diaper pouches. JuJuBe B.F.F. Diaper Bag: You can wear this bag as a backpack, messenger bag or shoulder bag—but our tester didn’t find it comfortable to wear, and it wasn’t quite big enough to fit all of our supplies. We also tested the Petunia Pickle Bottom Mini Bag and the Kibou Fanny Pack Diaper Bag. The Petunia Pickle Bottom Mini Bag is no longer in stock, and though the Kibou Fanny Pack Diaper Bag was our previous pick for the best diaper belt bag, the bag has since been discontinued. What we’re testing next: We’re continuing to test two No Reception bags, two Calpak diaper bags, including the Calpak Diaper Backpack With Laptop Sleeve, and plan to consider the new Away diaper bag collection as well as Uppababy’s Changing Backpack, among others. We’ve spent years testing diaper bags and between myself and two other testers, we’ve tested over 20 bags. For this round of testing in 2025, myself and baby and kids gear editor Margaret Badore tested a combined 11 bags, and some bags have been tested by multiple families. We tested the diaper bags in real-world situations, like daycare drop-offs, family outings and trips to the pediatrician’s office. Here’s a peek at what we looked for when we tested bags: The best diaper bags make it easier for you to get out and about with your kids. Here are some factors to consider when shopping for a diaper bag. The three most common types of diaper bags are backpack, fanny pack or belt bags and shoulder or tote bags. Many parents and caregivers want a diaper bag that fits their style as it can become an extension of themselves for quite a few years. Don’t forget to consider the preferences of your partner or other caregivers, too. While you might love a stylish floral print bag, another caregiver you’ll be sharing the bag with might not. Ergonomics are incredibly important, particularly for new moms. After delivery, moms might face weakened abdominal muscles and a weakened pelvic floor. They might also be recovering from a c-section or a perineal tear. For any parent or caregiver, an ergonomic diaper bag can help reduce the risk of developing back, neck and shoulder pain. Some ergonomic features to look for include wide, padded backpack straps that allow you to evenly distribute weight, structured bags that maintain their shape while wearing them and adjustable straps. Choosing a lightweight bag and limiting how much you pack can be beneficial, too. “It’s important that all moms choose a diaper bag that is lightweight and adjustable to safely distribute weight and support healing of the pelvic floor and abdominals that are often compromised from the strain endured during both pregnancy and childbirth,” says McCormick. “Moms experiencing postural changes or diastasis recti should prioritize ergonomic designs that prevent excessive forward hunching,” adds Gallucci. “Ultimately, a well-balanced, adjustable bag can help reduce discomfort and support postpartum recovery.” Diaper bags can have many features. Some helpful ones include insulated pockets, changing pads, diaper pockets, wipe pockets, device pockets, storage cubes or pouches and clips for keys and toys. “Durable and easy-to-clean materials can hold up to everyday use, make messes quick to resolve with less stress, and prevent caregiver fatigue by allowing the bag to be set down without concern for damage,” says McCormick. While some bags are machine washable, most are water-resistant and can be wiped clean. I’m a parenting writer, product tester and mom to three, and I cover baby and kids gear for Forbes Vetted. I’ve been testing baby, kids and parenting products for seven years, and I’ve tested many diaper bags on this list, some of which I’ve used for years. I test a wide range of products, from the best toys for 6-month-olds to the best strollers. In addition to testing products for this article, I also spoke to other parents and testers about which diaper bags they liked, conducted in-depth research, compared features of the diaper bags and interviewed four experts. Those experts include: At its core, a diaper bag is simply a place to carry baby essentials while you’re out and about. You can use a purse, backpack or any other type of bag as a diaper bag. However, many diaper bags have convenient features such as insulated bottle pockets, wipes pouches and elastic diaper storage pockets. They’re designed to carry all your baby essentials and often come with built-in changing pads, too. Prices of diaper bags can range from around $20 to over $200. Many durable and comfortable diaper bags fall in the $75 to $100 range. You might pay a bit more for something that’s more stylish or made of higher-end materials. When it comes to a diaper bag, the lighter, the better. As you add more things into the bag, it can get heavy, causing back and neck strain. Most diaper bags are 4 pounds or less with some belt bags weighing under a pound.

ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS(Millions except per share amounts and percentages) (Unaudited) ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(Millions) ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS(Millions) (Unaudited) ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.SELECTED CORPORATE DATA(Millions) (Unaudited) (1) The Company operates as three operating segments, Data Center, Client and Gaming, and Embedded segments.The Data Center segment primarily includes Artificial Intelligence (AI) accelerators, server microprocessors (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), accelerated processing units (APUs), data processing units (DPUs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Smart Network Interface Cards (SmartNICs) and Adaptive System-on-Chip (SoC) products for data centers.The Client and Gaming segment primarily includes CPUs, APUs, and chipsets for desktops and notebooks, and discrete GPUs, semi-custom SoC products and development services.The Embedded segment primarily includes embedded CPUs, GPUs, APUs, FPGAs, System on Modules (SOMs), and Adaptive SoC products. From time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its IP portfolio. All Other category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the operating segments, such as amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, employee stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, inventory loss at contract manufacturer and restructuring charges. (2) Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA The Company presents “Adjusted EBITDA” as a supplemental measure of its performance. Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by adjusting GAAP net income for interest expense, other (income) expense, net, income tax provision (benefit), equity income in investee, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, inventory loss at contract manufacturer, acquisition-related and other costs, and restructuring charges. The Company calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of net income or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities that can affect cash flows. (3) Reconciliation of GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow The Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by operating activities for capital expenditures, and free cash flow margin % is free cash flow expressed as a percentage of the Company's net revenue. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s calculation of free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities.

LipoJaro Ingredients Breakdown Exploring the Natural Compounds That Power LipoJaro LipoJaro’s formula is built on a blend of natural ingredients selected to support the body’s fat metabolism, appetite regulation, and digestive balance—without the use of stimulants. This focus aligns with 2025’s clean-label movement and the shift toward non-GMO, plant-based supplements for weight management. Below is a closer look at each of the key ingredients in LipoJaro and how they may contribute to a more sustainable wellness routine. While individual results will vary, the inclusion of these compounds is grounded in a combination of traditional use and emerging scientific research. Disclaimer: The following ingredient descriptions are for informational purposes only and are not intended to diagnose, treat, or prevent any disease. Consult your healthcare provider before beginning any supplement. Glucomannan Glucomannan is a water-soluble dietary fiber derived from the root of the konjac plant. Once ingested, it expands in the stomach by absorbing water, which may create a sensation of fullness and reduce overall calorie intake. Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) CLA is a type of fatty acid found in meat and dairy products, though LipoJaro uses a plant-derived version. CLA has been studied for its potential to promote fat oxidation and preserve lean body mass. Green Tea Extract Green tea extract contains catechins—especially EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate)—that are associated with fat-burning and antioxidant support. Garcinia Cambogia Derived from a tropical fruit, garcinia cambogia contains hydroxycitric acid (HCA), which has been explored for its potential role in suppressing appetite and reducing fat storage. Chromium Chromium is a trace mineral that may play a role in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Black Pepper Extract (BioPerine®) Black pepper extract is often added to enhance nutrient absorption. It improves bioavailability, making other ingredients in the formula more effective. Additional Botanicals and Synergistic Compounds While the primary ingredients carry most of the functional benefits, LipoJaro may also include supportive compounds such as: These additions are designed to round out the supplement and enhance its total impact over time. Designed for Ingredient Transparency LipoJaro’s formulation avoids artificial additives, preservatives, and synthetic fillers. Each capsule reflects the brand’s focus on quality, third-party testing, and manufacturing in GMP-certified facilities. Disclaimer: Effects are not guaranteed and may vary depending on the individual. Always verify ingredient labels for allergies or contraindications. No more jitters. Just results. Shop LipoJaro today and start your journey to better appetite control and metabolism—risk-free for 60 days! Reported Side Effects and Safety Considerations What to Know Before Starting LipoJaro While LipoJaro is marketed as a non-stimulant, natural weight management supplement, understanding its potential side effects and overall safety profile is important for informed use. Based on the formulation and user-reported feedback, most individuals tolerate the product well when taken as directed. That said, it's essential to explore how the body might initially respond to the active compounds, especially for first-time users or those with underlying health conditions. LipoJaro is formulated without common stimulants like caffeine or synephrine, which are often responsible for jitteriness, rapid heart rate, or sleep disturbances in traditional fat burners. Instead, it relies on a combination of fiber-rich and fat metabolism-supportive ingredients such as glucomannan, green tea extract, and CLA. These are generally considered gentle on the system, but they may cause mild digestive changes for some users during the adjustment period. Possible Mild Reactions Reported by Users Some individuals may experience: These effects are typically transient and tend to subside after the first few days of consistent use. Drinking adequate water when taking LipoJaro is essential for optimal fiber expansion and to prevent gastrointestinal discomfort. Disclaimer: These potential side effects are not experienced by everyone. Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional before beginning any new supplement, especially if you are pregnant, nursing, have a medical condition, or are taking prescription medications. Who Should Avoid Taking LipoJaro? Although LipoJaro is generally well-tolerated, there are cases where it may not be advisable. It may not be appropriate for individuals who: Because the supplement works partly by expanding in the stomach to help control appetite, it’simportant to take it with at least 8 oz of water. Taking it dry or without adequate hydration could result in discomfort or choking risk. A Clean-Label Alternative for Sensitive Users Compared to many over-the-counter weight loss products, LipoJaro offers a gentler approach—free of synthetic stimulants, harsh laxatives, or artificial colors and preservatives. This makes it appealing to those who have experienced side effects from stimulant-heavy formulas in the past or who prefer a cleaner supplement experience. As with any supplement, the best approach is to start slowly, listen to your body, and maintain open communication with a healthcare provider. LipoJaro's formula is designed for daily use, but it’s always smart to monitor how it fits into your personal health routine. Ready to ditch the crash diets?

Real User Results: What People Are Saying A Closer Look at the Lived Experience Behind the Label When evaluating a supplement like LipoJaro, it's not enough to simply review the ingredient list—real-world feedback from actual users offers some of the most valuable insight into what the product can or cannot do. Many people considering a non-stimulant fat burner want to know: Does LipoJaro actually work? What kinds of results can I expect? Are users satisfied with their outcomes? Across public reviews, feedback platforms, and testimonials shared on the official website, user impressions of LipoJaro show a mix of positive momentum and realistic expectations. While individual results vary, many users report benefits such as improved portion control, reduced cravings, more balanced energy levels, and modest but noticeable body composition changes when paired with healthy habits. Reported Positive Outcomes Common positive experiences include: For some individuals, the impact was not dramatic in the first few days, but became more noticeable with consistent use over two to three weeks. This gradual shift aligns with the supplement's intended purpose—supporting long-term metabolic and appetite regulation rather than forcing aggressive short-term weight loss. “After struggling with portion control for years, I finally feel like I’m in charge of my hunger instead of the other way around. LipoJaro made a big difference for me.” — Verified User Review “I wanted something without caffeine or jittery side effects. LipoJaro didn’t give me a quick fix, but it helped me stay consistent and avoid the late-night snacking that always ruined my progress.” — Verified Buyer Experience Realistic Expectations and Moderate Feedback While many users express satisfaction, some note that LipoJaro did not deliver drastic results on its own, especially without any dietary or exercise adjustments. A few reviewers mention needing to increase their water intake or adjust meal timing to better coordinate with the supplement. Others express the desire for quicker visual results, though they acknowledge the formula's stimulant-free nature and emphasis on sustainability over speed. Key Takeaways from User Feedback Disclaimer: Testimonials reflect individual experiences and are not guarantees of specific results. Supplement effects vary based on individual physiology, activity levels, and adherence to a healthy lifestyle. By analyzing user responses, it becomes clear that LipoJaro is built more for reliability and balance than extreme fat loss. Those looking for a clean-label, stimulant-free addition to their routine may find it a helpful tool on the journey to better metabolic health. Your metabolism deserves better. LipoJaro supports sustainable fat loss—no harsh stimulants. Order today and save up to $780 instantly! Common Complaints and How They’re Handled Addressing the Concerns Behind the Feedback While many LipoJaro users report positive experiences, it’s important to acknowledge and evaluate the most common concerns shared by customers. A transparent supplement review doesn’t just highlight benefits—it also takes into account areas where users may have encountered friction or unmet expectations. Like any widely distributed wellness product, LipoJaro receives a range of feedback. Most complaints are not about the formulation itself but revolve around order fulfillment, expectations for rapid results, or communication with customer service. Understanding these concerns—and how the company addresses them—can help potential buyers make a more informed decision. Most Frequently Reported Complaints Disclaimer: Experiences vary by customer. For all support issues, it’s best to retain order confirmation emails and communicate directly with the official support team to ensure accurate service. How LipoJaro’s Brand Responds LipoJaro’s website features a clear returns policy and states a 60-day satisfaction guarantee. To back this, they provide a dedicated customer service email to handle refund requests, product inquiries, and shipping updates. While this policy is in place, like any supplement company, response times can fluctuate based on volume. The company also encourages buyers to use the product consistently for at least 30 days before judging its effectiveness—especially because it is not formulated with fast-acting synthetic stimulants that might mask true metabolic shifts. Transparent Business Practices Matter Although no product is universally loved, a brand’s willingness to address concerns head-on and stand by its refund policy reflects positively on its business model. Customers are encouraged to review all terms of service, usage instructions, and return guidelines before purchasing. Disclaimer: Always refer to the official website for the latest return policy, terms of use, and customer service contact information. Business policies are subject to change. Who Should Consider LipoJaro? Identifying the Ideal User Profile LipoJaro is designed for individuals seeking support in managing weight-related challenges using a non-stimulant, plant-based approach. While it is not a substitute for a healthy lifestyle, it may offer meaningful support for people who struggle with appetite control, cravings, and slow metabolism—especially those looking to avoid harsh ingredients or quick-fix gimmicks. Based on the ingredients and reported effects, LipoJaro may be a good fit for the following groups: Why the Stimulant-Free Approach Appeals to a Broader Audience Many people avoid traditional fat burners due to side effects such as anxiety, heart palpitations, or disrupted sleep. LipoJaro’snon-stimulant formula allows for daily use without triggering the nervous system or interfering with natural energy cycles. This makes it an attractive option for those seeking gentle, sustainable weight management rather than short-term energy spikes. Additionally, the inclusion of fiber-based ingredients like glucomannan and digestion-enhancing compounds such as black pepper extract can appeal to people dealing with bloating, irregularity, or sluggish digestion—factors that can all contribute to weight retention. Disclaimer: LipoJaro is not intended for individuals under 18, those with swallowing difficulties, or anyone diagnosed with a medical condition without physician approval. Always speak with a qualified healthcare provider before beginning any new dietary supplement. Who Might Not Benefit While LipoJaro is formulated to be accessible and well-tolerated, it may not suit everyone. Individuals expecting rapid fat loss, or those who are not committed to making lifestyle adjustments alongside supplement use, may not achieve optimal outcomes. Similarly, anyone requiring a medically supervised weight loss program should not use over-the-counter supplements without direct approval from a medical professional. Supporting the Right Expectations LipoJaro works best as a complement to balanced nutrition, hydration, and movement. It is not a magic bullet, but rather a support tool for those who are ready to improve consistency and reduce self-sabotaging habits like emotional eating or erratic hunger patterns. When used as directed, it may help users feel more in control of their eating, experience gradual improvements in body composition, and support their long-term weight wellness goals.

How to Use LipoJaro for Maximum Benefit Following the Suggested Routine for Effective Results To get the most from any dietary supplement—especially one designed for non-stimulant metabolic support—consistency and proper timing matter. LipoJaro is formulated with ingredients like glucomannan, CLA, and green tea extract that work best when taken regularly and in conjunction with balanced lifestyle habits. According to the manufacturer, the recommended usage is to take two capsules per day, ideally 30 minutes before your two largest meals of the day, such as breakfast and lunch. This allows the ingredients to interact with food intake and support satiety before eating begins. Taking the capsules with at least 8 ounces of water is essential, particularly because glucomannan expands in the stomach to promote a sense of fullness. This hydration step is critical—not just for effectiveness, but for safety. Disclaimer: Never take LipoJaro dry or without sufficient water, as this could pose a choking hazard. Individuals with difficulty swallowing should not use this product. Tips for Integrating LipoJaro Into Your Daily Routine To optimize your experience with LipoJaro, consider the following best practices: What to Avoid While Taking LipoJaro Although LipoJaro is generally well-tolerated, it may be best to avoid pairing it with other fiber-heavy products or additional appetite suppressants without guidance from a healthcare provider. Overdoing fiber can lead to bloating or discomfort, especially if not spaced out properly. Additionally, combining LipoJaro with stimulant-based fat burners could be redundant and may offset its balanced, gentle effects. Disclaimer: Always read ingredient labels when combining supplements. If you are currently using other weight management products, consult a healthcare professional before adding LipoJaro to your routine. A Support Tool, Not a Standalone Solution LipoJaro works best when it's part of a bigger strategy that includes healthy meals, mindful eating, and light to moderate activity. While the supplement may help reduce calorie intake by encouraging smaller portion sizes and minimizing cravings, it is not intended to replace food, medication, or professional health guidance. When used with intention and discipline, LipoJaro may provide valuable support in staying on track, particularly for individuals prone to overeating or struggling with energy dips that derail consistent habits.

Science & Clinical Support The Research Behind LipoJaro’s Ingredient Strategy While LipoJaro as a branded supplement has not been subjected to its own clinical trials, several of its key ingredients are supported by independent studies and scientific literature that examine their potential roles in appetite control, fat metabolism, and digestive health. The formulation reflects a common evidence-informed strategy used in modern weight management supplements: targeting multiple metabolic pathways without relying on synthetic stimulants. Below is a breakdown of some of the research associated with LipoJaro’s core ingredients, including how they may function in the body to support weight wellness. Disclaimer: The following summary includes third-party research on individual ingredients. These studies do not imply guaranteed results from LipoJaro. Always consult with your healthcare provider before relying on supplements for clinical support. Glucomannan and Appetite Regulation Glucomannan is one of the most studied soluble fibers in the context of weight management. According to a 2005 study published in the International Journal of Obesity, participants who took glucomannan before meals showed greater reductions in body weight compared to a placebo group, primarily due to improved satiety and reduced calorie intake. Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) and Fat Oxidation CLA has been examined for its possible impact on body composition. A meta-analysis published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition reviewed 18 studies and found that CLA supplementation produced modest fat loss over time in overweight individuals. Green Tea Extract and Thermogenic Support Green tea extract—particularly its catechins like EGCG—has shown potential in increasing energy expenditure and supporting fat oxidation. A study in the Journal of Nutrition found that green tea extract enhanced fat burning during exercise. Garcinia Cambogia and Craving Control Garcinia cambogia contains hydroxycitric acid (HCA), which has been examined for its effects on appetite and serotonin levels. Some studies suggest it may reduce calorie intake by promoting a sensation of fullness. Chromium and Blood Sugar Support Chromium has been studied for its role in improving insulin sensitivity and glucose regulation. Maintaining stable blood sugar can influence hunger patterns and help reduce cravings for sweets or processed carbohydrates. BioPerine® (Black Pepper Extract) for Absorption BioPerine is frequently added to enhance the bioavailability of other nutrients, ensuring the body absorbs and utilizes ingredients more efficiently. This compound does not directly affect fat loss but may improve the overall efficacy of the supplement. LipoJaro’s ingredient profile reflects an alignment with clinical research, focusing on appetite control, energy utilization, and digestive health—all without harsh stimulants. Though more research is always needed on supplement synergy and long-term use, the product is formulated in a way that mirrors many successful strategies in modern wellness science.

Expert Opinions: What Health Professionals Say How Today’s Wellness Experts View LipoJaro’s Ingredient Strategy While LipoJaro has not been formally endorsed by a specific medical organization or clinical board, many of its individual ingredients reflect trends and strategies endorsed by integrative nutritionists and holistic health professionals. These experts often encourage a whole-body, stimulant-free approach to metabolic wellness—an approach that mirrors LipoJaro’s formulation. Given the increasing awareness of gut health, fiber intake, and blood sugar regulation in weight management, many professionals now emphasize the importance of dietary support that does not rely on chemical stimulants or extreme restriction. Supplements like LipoJaro that combine soluble fiber, thermogenic botanicals, and absorption-enhancing compounds offer a balanced alternative for individuals seeking gentle assistance in their health journey. Disclaimer: The opinions shared below reflect general statements from professionals on key ingredients used in LipoJaro. These are not direct endorsements of the product and should not replace individualized medical advice. Nutritionist Insight on Glucomannan Functional nutritionists often highlight glucomannan as a leading ingredient in natural appetite support. By expanding in the stomach and slowing digestion, it may help reduce overeating, especially when consumed with adequate water before meals. According to registered dietitians, soluble fiber like glucomannan plays a dual role: it supports satiety and improves digestive health. These benefits are particularly important for those who struggle with energy dips caused by blood sugar spikes after large meals. Professional Support for CLA and Green Tea Extract In the field of sports nutrition and weight management coaching, CLA and green tea extract are often used for individuals who need metabolic support without the overstimulation of caffeine-based products. These ingredients are praised for their ability to complement regular activity and healthy eating, not replace it. Practitioners point out that green tea catechins, in particular, may assist with mild thermogenesis and antioxidant defense, both of which are relevant for long-term wellness and recovery. Emphasis on Safe and Gentle Supplementation One key message echoed by many professionals is the importance of realistic expectations and personalization. Most experts agree that fat burners are not magic solutions—but when used with structure and discipline, a well-designed formula like LipoJaro may be a reasonable option for individuals needing support with consistency, especially in the areas of appetite control and daily routine management. They also value formulations that avoid harsh chemicals or artificial additives, which aligns with LipoJaro’s clean-label promise and manufacturing standards. As public understanding of metabolism, digestion, and long-term weight regulation continues to grow, more health professionals are embracing tools that gently support the body's natural systems rather than override them with temporary, high-intensity effects. LipoJaro fits this emerging philosophy by focusing on balance, sustainability, and ingredient integrity. LipoJaro vs Other Weight Loss Supplements How LipoJaro Stands Out in a Crowded Market With countless weight loss supplements competing for attention, it can be difficult for consumers to distinguish between products that offer real support and those built around marketing hype. LipoJaro differentiates itself by embracing a non-stimulant, clean-label approach that caters to individuals looking for sustainable weight management support without sacrificing long-term health. Unlike many traditional fat burners that rely heavily on caffeine or synthetic ingredients to trigger short-term effects like rapid energy bursts or dehydration-induced water loss, LipoJaro offers a plant-based formula that works gradually with the body to help regulate appetite, optimize digestion, and support fat metabolism. Comparison Factors to Consider 1. Formulation Strategy 2. Intended Use and User Sensitivity 3. Transparency and Clean Labeling 4. Customer-Centric Policies Disclaimer: All supplement comparisons are made based on available product information as of the time of writing. Individual product effectiveness and user satisfaction may vary. Always refer to official sources before making purchase decisions. Ideal for a Wellness-Focused Audience LipoJaro is better suited to consumers who value long-term health and are not seeking dramatic overnight transformations. It aligns with 2025 trends in personalized nutrition, gut health optimization, and non-stimulant metabolic support. Those who are already practicing mindful eating and incorporating regular movement may find it particularly helpful in curbing excess hunger and reinforcing dietary structure. By contrast, more aggressive fat burners may appeal to competitive athletes or short-term transformation seekers—but often at the expense of tolerability or holistic health.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is LipoJaro and how does it work? LipoJaro is a non-stimulant fat burner supplement formulated with plant-based ingredients like glucomannan, CLA, green tea extract, and garcinia cambogia.

Taken before meals with water, it expands in the stomach to help reduce calorie intake and cravings throughout the day. How do I take LipoJaro for best results? For optimal results, take two capsules daily—one before each of your two largest meals, ideally breakfast and lunch. Take the capsules with at least 8 ounces of water to activate the glucomannan fiber and promote satiety. Consistency is key, so daily use alongside balanced eating and movement is recommended. Can LipoJaro help me lose weight without diet or exercise? LipoJaro is intended to support healthy weight management when used as part of a comprehensive lifestyle plan. While some users may experience benefits like reduced appetite or fewer cravings, it is not a replacement for proper nutrition or physical activity.

Title: Adobe Premiere Pro vs. Apple Final Cut Pro: Which Video Editing App Should You Use?
URL: https://me.pcmag.com/en/video-editing/29704/adobe-premiere-pro-vs-apple-final-cut-pro-which-video-editing-app-should-you-use
Time Published: 2025-05-06T18:36:26Z
Full Content:
Apple's Final Cut Pro gives you a wealth of powerful video editing tools in a relatively simple interface, making it well worth the one-time price for professionals and serious hobbyists alike. VS Adobe Premiere Pro is an expansive, professional-level video editing program with top-notch editing tools, swift rendering speeds, useful collaboration features, and a well-designed interface. Adobe Premiere Pro requires a Creative Cloud subscription. You have three main options: an annual plan you pay up front ($263.88), an annual plan you pay monthly ($22.99 per month), or a month-to-month plan ($34.49 per month). Adobe also offers more affordable plans for students and pricier ones for businesses. If you want the entire Creative Cloud suite, which includes Audition, Photoshop, Illustrator, and a raft of other Adobe creative software, you need to pay $59.99 per month. The subscription model not only gets you program updates, which Adobe delivers semiannually, but also 100GB of cloud storage for syncing media. Any of these plans entitles you to activate the software on just two computers. A perpetual license for Final Cut Pro costs $299.99. It works out to be cheaper than Premiere Pro after just a year and a half, and you still get feature updates. Final Cut Pro is available from the Mac App Store, which eases the process of downloading updates and lets you install the program on multiple computers as long as you sign into the same Apple account. Winner: Apple Final Cut Pro Premiere Pro runs on both Windows and macOS. The online user guide states that it is the company's policy "to support the current and the most recent previous version of each operating system." For the moment, that means Windows 10 (64-bit) version 22H2 (or later) or Windows 11 with: On macOS, you need version 12 or later with: Premiere Pro runs on Apple silicon–based Macs natively. As you might expect, Final Cut Pro runs only on Macs. It requires macOS 14.6 or later, 8GB of RAM (it recommends 16GB), and a Metal-capable graphics card for Intel-based computers. For VR headset support, you also need SteamVR. Final Cut Pro runs smoothly on Apple silicon–based Macs as a native application. Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro Premiere Pro stays true to the tradition of high-end, professional-level software. Ease of use and simplicity of interface are not paramount among its goals. That said, there's no reason that a determined amateur with time to devote to learning the software couldn’t use it. Adobe has other products more appropriate for hobbyists, including Premiere Elements. Apple makes the upgrade path from its consumer-level video editor, iMovie, very smooth. The latest version of Final Cut on the desktop also makes it easy to import projects you started on an iPhone or iPad. Winner: Apple Final Cut Pro Premiere Pro uses a traditional nonlinear editor (NLE) timeline with tracks and track heads. It calls your timeline content a sequence, and you can create nested sequences, subsequences, and subclips to keep everything organized. The timeline has tabs for multiple sequences, which can be helpful if you're working with nested sequences. Longtime video editors are likely more comfortable with this setup than with Apple's more inventive trackless Magnetic Timeline. Adobe's system also fits with some pro workflows in which the tracks are in an expected arrangement. It works differently from consumer video editing apps, however, because it automatically separates a clip's audio track from its video. The timeline is very scalable and offers the usual razor, ripple, roll, slip, and slide tools. The interface is extremely configurable, letting you undock any and all panels. You can show or hide FX badges, keyframes, thumbnails, and waveforms. You get seven preconfigured workspaces (including Assembly, Editing, Color, and Titles) compared with Final Cut's mere three. Apple's innovative trackless Magnetic Timeline is easier on the eyes than the traditional timeline interface, and it offers several editing advantages, such as connected Auditions, clips, and roles (descriptive labels such as Dialog, Effects, Music, Titles, and Video). Auditions let you designate optional clips or takes for a spot in your movie, and you can group clips into compound clips—roughly the equivalent of Premiere's Nested Sequences. Instead of tracks, Final Cut Pro uses lanes, with a primary storyline that everything else attaches to. This makes keeping everything in sync easier than in Premiere. Final Cut Pro's interface is less configurable than Premiere's. You can't split panels off into windows, except for the Preview window, which is very spare in the control department—the only options are Play and Pause. Premiere offers a lot more here, with buttons for Export Frame, Extract, Go to In, Go to Previous Edit Point, Lift, and Step Back. As mentioned, Final Cut offers just three prebuilt workspaces (Color & Effects, Default, and Organize). Winner: Tie Like a traditional NLE, Premiere Pro lets you store related media in bins, which are similar to folders. As with folders, you can have bins within bins. You can also apply color labels to assets, but not keyword tags. The Libraries panel lets you share assets among other Adobe applications, such as After Effects and Photoshop. Apple's program organizes your media through events, keyword tagging, libraries, and roles. The library is the overarching container that includes your projects, events, and clips, and it keeps track of all your edits and options. You can also manage storage targets and perform batch clip renaming. Winner: Apple Final Cut Pro Premiere Pro works with pretty much any media format of any level of professionalism, as well as media type for which you installed codecs on your computer. That even includes Apple ProRes. The software supports working with native (raw) camera formats, including those for ARRI, Canon, Panasonic, RED, and Sony. There's not much video you can create or import that Premiere can't handle. It even supports XML documents you export from Final Cut Pro.Final Cut Pro works with the HEVC codec that many 4K video cameras and Apple's iPhones use. Like Premiere Pro, Final Cut supports native formats from all the major video camera makers, including ARRI, Canon, Panasonic, RED, and Sony, as well as many video-capable still cameras. It, too, handles XML file imports and exports.Winner: Tie After Effects, Premiere's stablemate in the Creative Cloud ecosystem, is the industry-standard motion graphics tool. It dovetails smoothly with Premiere Pro but is more difficult to master than Apple Motion, which now has many of the same capabilities. Regardless, After Effects is the tool to learn if you want to pursue professional video editing as a career. The app costs $263.88 per year. Apple Motion is also a powerful tool for creating effects, titles, and transitions. It supports custom templates, logical layers, and a rich plug-in ecosystem. Motion is probably a better fit if you use Final Cut Pro as your primary editor. Even if you don't, it's just a one-time, $49.99 purchase.Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro The latest generative AI feature to land in Adobe's video software is Generative Extend, which creates extra video frames (including 4K) from the surrounding content for cases in which a clip isn't quite long enough to fit the rest of your timeline. Other Premiere Pro features include AI speech-to-text with automatic translation, color management that recognizes raw and log footage and automatically color-corrects it, and Media Intelligence, which recognizes clip contents to help you find them. Apple's pro video editor is playing catch-up with Premiere Pro. It now includes auto-captioning from speech in videos, but still lacks both text-based editing and video generation capabilities. It does, however, integrate with macOS's Image Playground to generate cartoon-like still images, for what that's worth. Magnetic Mask (apply effects just to fine-tuned masked areas) and Scene Removal round out some of the other recent AI tools in the app. Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro Premiere Pro includes the Lumetri Color tools. These are pro-level color grading features that were formerly part of the standalone SpeedGrade application. The Lumetri tools support 3D lookup tables (LUTs) for powerful and customizable looks. The tools offer a remarkable amount of color manipulation, along with a great selection of film and HDR looks. You can adjust black point, contrast, exposure, highlights, shadows, and white balance—all of which you can activate with keyframes. Faded Film, Saturation, Sharpen, and Vibrance adjustment presets are also available. Most impressive are the Color Wheel and Curves options. The Lumetri Scope view is also especially cool; it shows the current frame's proportional use of red, green, and blue. As mentioned, Premiere Pro includes a dedicated workspace for color editing. To compete with Adobe's impressive Lumetri Color tools, Final Cut has a Color Wheel tool that's impressive in its own right. Color Wheels show a puck in the middle that lets you move an image toward green, blue, or red; the result appears to the side of the wheel. You can also adjust brightness and saturation with the wheels, separately control everything (with the Master wheel), or adjust just shadows, midtones, or highlights. It's a remarkably powerful and intuitive set of tools. If wheels are not to your taste, the Color Board option shows a simple linear view of your color settings. The Color Curves tool lets you use multiple control points to adjust each of the three primary colors for very specific points on the brightness scale. Luma, RGB Parade, and Vectorscope monitors give you incredible insight into your movie's color usage. You can even edit a single color value using a dropper. Final Cut now supports color LUTs from camera manufacturers such as ARRI, Canon, Red, and Sony, as well as custom LUTs for effects. You can combine these effects with others in a stacked arrangement. Color scopes adapt to HDR editing, as do the color editing tools. Supported formats include Rec. 2020 HLG and Rec. 2020 PQ for HDR10 output.Winner: Tie Premiere offers Photoshop-like control over title text formatting, with a vast number of adjustments and fonts such as kerning, leading, rotation, shadow, stroking, and tracking, just to name a few. But for 3D manipulation, you need to head to After Effects. For captions, Premiere Pro is a hard act to follow: It not only creates captions from spoken words in your video, but, as mentioned, it also lets you edit based on the captions. As a result, you can take out ums and uhs in the video simply by removing the text from the caption. Premiere can then automatically translate the captions into 27 international languages and display multiple language tracks at once. Final Cut Pro includes strong 3D title editing with keyframe motion options. You get lots of control over title overlays, with dozens of animation templates. You edit text and position and size the titles right in the video preview; there's no need for an external title editor. Final Cut Pro's 3D Titles offer eight basic templates and four more cinematic ones, including a cool 3D Earth choice for sci-fi projects. There are 20 font presets, but you can use any style and size you like. Materials such as concrete, fabric, and plastic give your titles any texture you desire. You also get a bunch of lighting options. For maximum control, you can edit the 3D titles in Motion. Extrude 2D titles into 3D by tapping the 3D Text option in the Text Inspector, and you can then position and rotate the text to taste on three axes. Apple's software can now automatically transcribe spoken words in clips to text captions, but Premiere Pro goes way beyond that, identifying separate speakers, translating, and allowing text-based timeline editing. Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro Premiere Pro lets you play 360-degree VR footage and change the field of view and angle. You can watch this content in anaglyphic form, which is a fancy way of saying you can see it in 3D using standard red-and-blue glasses. You can also have your video track a head-mounted display's view. You can't use Premiere Pro (or Final Cut Pro) to edit 360-degree footage unless you stitch it into equirectangular format. Corel VideoStudio, CyberLink PowerDirector, and Pinnacle Studio can all open 360-degree footage without this conversion. You can't see the spherical view alongside the flattened view in Premiere like in those apps, but you can easily toggle between them if you add the VR button to the preview window. Helpfully, Premiere lets you tag a video as VR so that Facebook or YouTube can tell it's 360-degree content. Apple's pro video editor now has better 360-degree features, including support for Apple's VisionPro and the HTC Vive (sorry Meta Quest users). It offers 360-degree titles, some effects, and a nifty Patch tool that removes the camera and tripod from your movie. With the standalone Compressor app ($49.99), you can share 360-degree video directly to Facebook, Vimeo, and YouTube. You also get stabilization for 360-degree video. Winner: Tie Premiere Pro's Audio Mixer shows balance, mute/solo, clipping indicator, pan, volume unit (VU) meter controls for all timeline tracks. You can use it to make adjustments as the project plays. The app automatically creates new tracks when you drop an audio clip in the timeline, and you can specify types, such as 5.1, adaptive, mono, standard (which can contain a combination of mono and stereo files), and stereo. Double-clicking the VU meters or panning dials returns their levels to zero. The audio meters next to Premiere's timeline are resizable and let you solo any track. The program also supports hardware controllers and third-party VSP plug-ins. If you have Adobe Audition, you can round-trip your audio between that and Premiere Pro for advanced techniques such as adaptive noise reduction, automatic click removal, compression, parametric EQ, and studio reverb. Audio editing is a strength of Final Cut Pro. It can automatically fix hum, noise, and peaks, or you can manually take care of these problems. Over 1,300 royalty-free sound effects are available, as are a long list of plug-ins. One impressive trick is the ability to match separately recorded tracks. For example, if you shoot HD footage with a DSLR and record sound simultaneously on another recorder, the Match Audio feature aligns the sound source (Premiere Pro has a similar feature). Support for Apple Logic Pro plug-ins gives you even more powerful sound editing options. Finally, you get a surround-sound mixer to animate or locate 5.1 audio, as well as either a 10- or 31-band equalizer.Winner: Tie Premiere Pro offers more export formats than you are ever likely to need. You get even more options via the Media Encoder app, which can target Blu-ray, DVD, Facebook, Twitter, or Vimeo formats. Encoder lets you batch encode to target multiple devices in a single job, such as mobile phones, iPads, and HDTVs. Premiere can also output media using H.265 and the Rec. 2020 color space. Adobe's updated Export interface mode makes the process simpler yet more powerful; it lets you choose multiple social targets. Final Cut Pro's output options are comparatively limited unless you add the companion application, Apple Compressor. The base app can, however, export to XML and produce HDR, wide-color-space output including Rec. 2020 Hybrid Log Gamma and Rec. 2020 HDR10. Compressor adds the ability to customize output settings and perform batch output jobs. It also adds support for Blu-ray and DVD menus and chapter themes. You can even package movies in the format necessary for iTunes. Winner: Tie Like most modern video editors, Premiere Pro uses proxy views of your video content to speed up apparent performance, and I didn't encounter any lag while testing normal editing operations. The software takes advantage of graphics CUDA and OpenCL hardware acceleration and multicore CPUs with its Adobe Mercury Playback Engine. Premiere Pro locks the app during exporting by default, though you can get around this behavior by choosing Queue in the Export dialog via the Media Encoder app. One of the primary goals of Final Cut Pro is to take advantage of 64-bit processing and the newer Apple silicon chips. Conveniently, exporting in Final Cut happens in the background, so you can continue working in the program. I test export time by creating a 5-minute movie consisting of four clips of mixed types with a standard set of transitions. My test media files include some 8K and more 4K source clips. I render it to H.264 1080p, 60fps, using H.264 High Profile. The audio is AAC 192Kbps. For testing, I use a MacBook Air with an M1 processor and 8GB of RAM running macOS Sequoia. It's on the low end of power for video editing, so it shows differences more distinctly than more expensive hardware. Premiere Pro easily bested Final Cut Pro. The former completed the task in 170 seconds, while the latter required 205 seconds. Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro Adobe maintains a large ecosystem of creative apps and services to support Premiere Pro. Aside from the Creative Cloud apps that work smoothly with Premiere, including After Effects, Audition, and Photoshop, Adobe offers the Premiere Rush mobile app, from which you can import projects. Adobe Express and Firefly, both of which you get with a Premiere subscription, include powerful AI video generation capabilities. Another app, Adobe Capture, lets you snap images for use as colors, shapes, and textures in Premiere Pro. Adobe's support for Frame.io collaboration and cloud storage is important for professional use. Other lesser-known Creative Cloud apps include Adobe Character Animator, a nifty app that produces animations based on live actors' faces and body movements, and Animate, which does the same for illustrations. You can bring both types of projects into Premiere Pro. Finally, the Adobe Stock integration comes in handy for those times you need B-roll or other stock media. Unfortunately, Stock is not part of a Premiere Pro subscription; plans start at $29.99 per month. It's a snap to import projects from iMovie on an iPhone or iPad into the pro editor, as mentioned. And that goes for the newer Final Cut Camera app, available on iPhone and iPad. The Final Cut iPad app ($4.99 per month) allows multicam shooting, as does the Camera app. The already-mentioned Motion and Compressor sibling applications, along with Apple's high-end sound editor, Logic Pro, extend the program's capabilities, but that collection of apps can't compete with Premiere Pro's. Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro PC hardware is nice, but it’s not much use without innovative software. I’ve been reviewing software for PCMag since 2008, and I still get a kick out of seeing what's new in video and photo editing software, and how operating systems change over time. I was privileged to byline the cover story of the last print issue of PC Magazine, the Windows 7 review, and I’ve witnessed every Microsoft win and misstep up to the latest Windows 11. I’m an avid bird photographer and traveler—I’ve been to 40 countries, many with great birds! Because I’m also a classical music fan and former performer, I’ve reviewed streaming services that emphasize classical music. PCMag is obsessed with culture and tech, offering smart, spirited coverage of the products and innovations that shape our connected lives and the digital trends that keep us talking.

Title: Vornado Realty Trust Earnings Beat Estimates in Q1

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Vornado Realty Trust posted better-than-expected earnings results for the first quarter of 2025, and provided more details on its massive 70-year lease with New York University (NYU), sending its stock higher by more than 3 percent on Tuesday afternoon. The real estate giant reported quarterly funds from operations (FFO) of $126.2 million, or 63 cents per diluted share, above the 55 cents per diluted share reported for the same period last year and topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 52 cents per share. Net income for the first quarter was $86.8 million, or 43 cents per diluted share, above the net loss of 5 cents per diluted share for the first quarter of 2024. Revenue was $461.5 million for 2025’s first quarter, exceeding the $436.3 million reported for last year’s first quarter. It also beat the Zacks estimate by 3 percent. Vornado attributed its strong quarterly performance to the $350 million sale of a portion of Japanese clothing retailer Uniqlo’s flagship store at 666 Fifth Avenue in Midtown, the ground rent at its Penn 1 building being set nearly $11 million lower than Vornado expected — although at a price which is still under litigation — and strong leasing activity in Manhattan. “Manhattan continues to be the best real estate market in the country, especially so for office, but also for apartments and retail,” Steven Roth, CEO of Vornado, said on the company’s earnings call. “In the 180 million-square-foot Class A better building market in which we compete, demand continues to be robust.” On Monday, Vornado announced the completion of the 1.1 million-square-foot, 70-year master lease at 770 Broadway with NYU, which it first mentioned in November. The university made a prepaid lease payment of $935 million to Vornado and will make annual lease payments of $9.3 million for the entire life of the lease, Vornado said. Vornado was facing a hole in the property after Facebook parent Meta said it would drop 275,000 square feet once its lease expired, but NYU swooped in to take over the entire building. “We use a portion of the prepaid rent payment to repay the $700 million mortgage loan, which previously encumbered the property, and $200 million to increase our cash balances,” Roth said on the call. “Though, this transaction is a lease … it is treated as a sale.” Vornado had an active quarter of leasing activity across the retail and office space for the 2025 first quarter. The company leased 1.04 million square feet across its portfolio — 709,000 square feet of that in New York City — and commanded starting rents of $95 per square foot, Roth said. That includes the 337,000 square feet Universal Music signed at Penn 2. At the start of the earnings call, Roth acknowledged that the current macroeconomic environment is very different from its fourth-quarter earnings call in February. Still, despite political and economic uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump’s tariffs, Roth has a positive outlook going forward, saying tariffs could “make a big dent in getting our federal budget deficit under control.” “Notwithstanding the tactics, reducing government bloat has to be a good thing,” Roth said. “I am agnostic, whatever the outcome. I believe that this global kerfuffle will be resolved more quickly than you think.” Amanda Schiavo can be reached at aschiavo@commercialobserver.com.

Large AI Overviews on SERPs are affecting visibility and causing a dramatic decrease in traffic. Effective faceted navigation can support SEO – if implemented correctly. Learn how to avoid index bloat, crawl issues, and ranking setbacks. This week’s question tackles the potential SEO fallouts when implementing faceted navigation: “How can ecommerce sites implement SEO-friendly faceted navigation without hurting crawl efficiency or creating index bloat?” Faceted navigation is a game-changer for user experience (UX) on large ecommerce sites. It helps users quickly narrow down what they’re looking for, whether it’s a size 8 pair of red road running trainers for women, or a blue, waterproof winter hiking jacket for men. For your customers, faceted navigation makes huge inventories feel manageable and, when done right, enhances both UX and SEO. However, when these facets create a new URL for every possible filter combination, they can lead to significant SEO issues that harm your rankings, and waste valuable crawl budget if not managed properly. Faceted navigation issues often fly under the radar – until they start causing real SEO damage. The good news? You don’t need to be a tech wizard to spot the early warning signs. With the right tools and a bit of detective work, you can uncover whether filters are bloating your site, wasting crawl budget, or diluting rankings. Here’s a step-by-step approach to auditing your site for faceted SEO issues: Start by searching on Google with this query: site:yourdomain.com. This will show you all the URLs Google has indexed for your site. Review the list: If so, you may have index bloat. Check Google Search Console (GSC) for a clearer picture. Look under “Coverage” to see how many pages are indexed. Pay attention to the “Indexed, not submitted in sitemap” section for unintended filter-generated pages. Not all faceted navigation behaves the same. Make sure you understand how filters work on your site: Some faceted pages drive traffic; others burn crawl budget without returns. Use tools like Botify, Screaming Frog, or Ahrefs to compare Googlebot’s crawling behavior with actual organic visits. If a page gets crawled a lot but doesn’t attract visitors, it’s a sign that it’s consuming crawl resources unnecessarily. Run a crawler to scan your site’s URLs. Check for repetitive patterns, such as endless combinations of parameters like ?price=low&sort=best-sellers. These are potential crawler traps and unnecessary variations. To decide which SEO tactics to use for faceted navigation, assess the search demand for specific filters and whether unique content can be created for those variations. Use keyword research tools like Google Keyword Planner or Ahrefs to check for user demand for specific filter combinations. For example: This helps prioritize which facet combinations should be indexed. If there’s enough value in targeting a specific query, such as product features, a dedicated URL may be worthwhile. However, low-value filters like price or size should remain no-indexed to avoid bloated indexing. The decision should balance the effort needed to create new URLs against the potential SEO benefits. Log files record every request, including those from search engine bots. By analyzing them, you can track which URLs Googlebot is crawling and how often, helping you identify wasted crawl budget on low-value pages. For example, if Googlebot is repeatedly crawling deep-filtered URLs like /jackets?size=large&brand=ASICS&price=100-200&page=12 with little traffic, that’s a red flag. Key signs of inefficiency include: By regularly checking your logs, you get a clear picture of Googlebot’s behavior, enabling you to optimize crawl budget and focus Googlebot’s attention on more valuable pages. Here’s how to keep things under control, so your site stays crawl-efficient and search-friendly. Start with the basics: Your facet labels should be intuitive. “Blue,” “Leather,” “Under £200” – these need to make instant sense to your users. Confusing or overly technical terms can lead to a frustrating experience and missed conversions. Not sure what resonates? Check out competitor sites and see how they’re labeling similar filters. Just because you can add 30 different filters doesn’t mean you should. Too many options can overwhelm users and generate thousands of unnecessary URL combinations. Stick to what genuinely helps customers narrow down their search. If your platform allows it, use clean, readable URLs for facets like /sofas/blue rather than messy query strings like ?color[blue]. Reserve query parameters for optional filters (e.g., sort order or availability), and don’t index those. Use canonical tags to point similar or filtered pages back to the main category/parent page. This helps consolidate link equity and avoid duplicate content issues. Just remember, canonical tags are suggestions, not commands. Google may ignore them if your filtered pages appear too different or are heavily linked internally. For any faceted pages you want indexed, these should include a self-referencing canonical, and for any that don’t, canonicalize these to the parent page. Break your URLs into three clear groups: No matter the order in which users apply filters, the resulting URL should be consistent. For example, /trainers/blue/leather and /trainers/leather/blue should result in the same URL, or else you’ll end up with duplicate content that dilutes SEO value. One way to reduce unnecessary crawling is by blocking faceted URLs through your robots.txt file. That said, it’s important to know that robots.txt is more of a polite request than a strict rule. Search engines like Google typically respect it, but not all bots do, and some may interpret the syntax differently. To prevent search engines from crawling pages you don’t want indexed, it’s also smart to ensure those pages aren’t linked to internally or externally (e.g., backlinks). If search engines find value in those pages through links, they might still crawl or index them, even with a disallow rule in place. Here’s a basic example of how to block a faceted URL pattern using the robots.txt file. Suppose you want to stop crawlers from accessing URLs that include a color parameter: User-agent: * Disallow: /*color* In this rule: However, if your faceted navigation requires a more nuanced approach, such as blocking most color options but allowing specific ones, you’ll need to mix Disallow and Allow rules. For instance, to block all color parameters except for “black,” your file might include: User-agent: * Disallow: /*color* Allow: /*color=black* A word of caution: This strategy only works well if your URLs follow a consistent structure. Without clear patterns, it becomes harder to manage, and you risk accidentally blocking key pages or leaving unwanted URLs crawlable. If you’re working with complex URLs or an inconsistent setup, consider combining this with other techniques like meta noindex tags or parameter handling in Google Search Console. Internal links signal importance to search engines. So, if you link frequently to faceted URLs that are canonicalized or blocked, you’re sending mixed signals. Consider using rel=”nofollow” on links you don’t want crawled – but be cautious. Google treats nofollow as a hint, not a rule, so results may vary. Point to only canonical URLs within your website wherever possible. This includes dropping parameters and slugs from links that are not necessary for your URLs to work. You should also prioritize pillar pages; the more inlinks a page has, the more authoritative search engines will deem that page to be. In 2019, Google’s John Mueller said: “In general, we ignore everything after hash… So things like links to the site and the indexing, all of that will be based on the non hash URL. And if there are any links to the hashed URL, then we will fold up into the non hash URL.” Track which filters users actually engage with, and which lead to conversions. If no one ever uses the “beige” filter, it may not deserve crawlable status. Use tools like Google Analytics 4 or Hotjar to see what users care about and streamline your navigation accordingly. When a filtered page returns no results, respond with a 404 status, unless it’s a temporary out-of-stock issue, in which case show a friendly message stating so, and return a 200. This helps avoid wasting crawl budget on thin content. When you interact with a page – say, filtering a product list, selecting a color, or typing in a live search box – AJAX lets the site fetch or send data behind the scenes, so the rest of the page stays put. It can be really effective to implement facets client-side via AJAX, which doesn’t create multiple URLs for every filter change. This reduces unnecessary load on the server and improves performance. Faceted navigation often leads to large sets of results, which naturally introduces pagination (e.g., ?category=shoes&page=2). But when combined with layered filters, these paginated URLs can balloon into thousands of crawlable variations. Left unchecked, this can create serious crawl and index bloat, wasting search engine resources on near-duplicate pages. So, should paginated URLs be indexed? In most cases, no. Pages beyond the first page rarely offer unique value or attract meaningful traffic, so it’s best to prevent them from being indexed while still allowing crawlers to follow links. The standard approach here is to use noindex, follow on all pages after page 1. This ensures your deeper pagination doesn’t get indexed, but search engines can still discover products via internal links. When it comes to canonical tags, you’ve got two options depending on the content. If pages 2, 3, and so on are simply continuations of the same result set, it makes sense to canonicalize them to page 1. This consolidates ranking signals and avoids duplication. However, if each paginated page features distinct content or meaningful differences, a self-referencing canonical might be the better fit. The key is consistency – don’t mix page 2 canonical to page 1 and page 3 to itself, for example. About rel=”next” and rel=”prev,” while Google no longer uses these signals for indexing, they still offer UX benefits and remain valid HTML markup. They also help communicate page flow to accessibility tools and browsers, so there’s no harm in including them. To help control crawl depth, especially in large ecommerce sites, it’s wise to combine pagination handling with other crawl management tactics: For example, a faceted URL like /trainers?color=white&brand=asics&page=3 would typically: Handling pagination well is just as important as managing the filters themselves. It’s all part of keeping your site lean, crawlable, and search-friendly. When properly managed, faceted navigation can be an invaluable tool for improving user experience, targeting long-tail keywords, and boosting conversions. However, without the right SEO strategy in place, it can quickly turn into a crawl efficiency nightmare that damages your rankings. By following the best practices outlined above, you can enjoy all the benefits of faceted navigation while avoiding the common pitfalls that often trip up ecommerce sites.

Title: Meta's layoffs were supposed to target low performers. These employees share how it felt to them.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-layoffs-low-performance-cuts-review-cycle-politics-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-05-06T09:00:01Z
Full Content:
Months after Meta's high-profile culling of low performers, the stigma associated with the job cuts still stings. CEO Mark Zuckerberg's push to "raise the bar on performance" saw about 5% of its workforce — roughly 3,600 employees — laid off in a sweeping round of cuts in February. The company said it targeted its lowest performers, but some former employees pushed back on that. Some said they had received positive ratings months earlier. Others said they were on medical or parental leave, mid-transfer between teams, or hadn't received a formal rating yet. Some speculated that conflict with a manager was the deciding factor. As of late April, laid-off employees received severance payouts. The eight accounts below offer a sense of how employees who were let go experienced the cuts and their concern about how it could affect their futures. BI has verified the performance records of these ex-workers, who asked for anonymity because they fear the "low performer" label could hurt future job prospects. A Meta spokesperson reiterated what the company previously shared with BI earlier this year about its low-performer cuts: "Let me be clear, these were performance-based terminations," the spokesperson said. "Prior ratings were not downgraded. Simply because someone had a history of meeting or exceeding expectations does not mean they continue to consistently meet the bar." The spokesperson added that Meta employees are held accountable to a goal-based culture of high performance. A former employee in Meta's human resources division had returned to work after being on parental leave for nearly five months when his division lost close to 10% of its staff. His midyear review put him "At or Above Expectations" — the middle tier — but his year-end rating was "Meets Most," which made him eligible for termination. "I tried calling my boss immediately, but in my heart, I knew it probably wasn't an error — Meta wouldn't make a mistake that significant." He said the manager was distressed but repeated: "I can't say anything. It's just part of Mark's mandate. It's a hard year." He said he didn't know why his rating had fallen. "We can't even see the feedback our managers wrote for us," he said. "Once the shock wore off, there was actually a mix of emotions — including some relief at being freed from that situation." But he does worry about carrying the low-performer label. "It's one thing to be let go in a restructuring," he said. "It's another to have your professional reputation potentially damaged by being mischaracterized as an underperformer." A former senior machine learning engineer at Meta described the shock of being laid off, only for a Meta recruiter to invite her to reapply three days later and skip the interview process. "Same email address. Same person. No acknowledgment of what had just happened. It felt surreal," she said. She said she joined Meta in early 2024 and earned a midyear review of "At or Above Expectations." Initially rated "Meets All Expectations" in the January 2025 year-end review, she was downgraded to "Meets Most Expectations" after a second round of director-level reviews. She said she suspects "directors were under pressure to hit a layoff quota." Before the layoff, she was dissatisfied with her manager and sought a transfer to a top-tier team. It was approved, but she was told the move could lower her rating, so she waited — only to be pink-slipped. She said she's not taking the recruiter up on her offer. Ultimately, she's confident she can land or create her next opportunity. "I'll be fine. I can get another job or start something of my own." This software engineer who joined Meta in May 2024 to work on cross-platform content sharing said a promising start unraveled because of internal politics over a new feature he prototyped. He said he took a four-month leave for burnout in August and returned in December to complete two more projects. Two weeks before the layoffs, he said, his new manager told the team everyone was "safe." Then came the termination email — and a performance rating of "Meets Some Expectations," low on Meta's end-of-year rating scale. "How could they evaluate my performance when I'd only worked 10 weeks in 2024?" he said, adding that an HR director had said he was "too new to evaluate." Although he's now fielding interest from other companies and expects to receive 16 weeks of severance, he still feels the sting of his rating. "The harmful 'low performer' label still feels wrong," he said. This product manager joined Facebook as a contractor in 2018, converted to full time in 2020, and consistently received a year-end "Greatly Exceeds Expectations" ratings label. In 2023, when she moved to Reality Labs, "everything changed," she said. "My manager would call late at night to question my capabilities and create doubt, even though teammates gave me positive feedback," she said. A review in early 2024 dropped her two tiers to "Meets All Expectations." Feedback included accusations that she was "blinded" by a "desire for promotion," she said. In August, she took a 12-week disability leave "because I was physically ill from all the stress." She returned in November and was laid off in February. She's being "selective" in her hunt for a new job. "The experience damaged my health, affected my family, and forced me onto medication for anxiety. I need to walk away from toxicity at the first sign, not wait until it affects my health and family again." A technical program manager was laid off after seven years of good performance ratings at Meta. A reorganization placed her under a new manager a few months earlier — a shift she felt exposed her. "When managers have to meet quotas and choose someone to cut, people with less history on the team are at higher risk," she said. "I contacted my manager in shock" after the termination notice, she said. "I just wanted five minutes to talk to ensure I wasn't going crazy." The manager responded with a templated email — the same company-approved language she had been required to use the day before when laying off her own direct report. She still doesn't know exactly what led to their selection. "Was it because I had significant equity vested when the stock price was low?" she said. " Was it because I expressed disappointment about Meta rolling back DEI programs on internal forums? I'll never know — but there's clearly more to this story than simply cutting the lowest performers." After 14 years at Google and three at Meta, a program manager said she was laid off despite a strong performance record: "At Meta, I'd even received 'Exceeds Expectations' and the rare 'Redefines Expectations.'" She said her manager told her she was doing "a great job" at the midyear review. "I was candid with my manager — sometimes critically, but always constructively — about where I thought things could improve," she said. "I was transparent about how stress in my personal life was affecting me: My husband had been laid off, and we were caring for a special-needs child." She said her manager told her not to worry, but she'd noticed a shift in tone at Meta — for example, when chief technology officer Andrew "Boz" Bosworth said a worker who alleged mistreatment should just quit. "The compassionate tone of the 2022 layoffs — the regret, the messaging about hard decisions — feels like a distant memory," she said. "This round was cutthroat. Silent. Cold. 'The Hunger Games,' but for high performers." "I wrote a final email to my skip-level manager," she added. "Not to get my job back. Not even to get a reply (I didn't). I just wanted to be heard. To say: I know I did good work. I know I didn't deserve this. And I hope someone — anyone — in leadership still has the humanity to care." This employee spent years working on critical internal systems. In the days before the layoffs, he focused on ensuring everything would run smoothly. He had received consistently strong performance ratings and said his managers agreed he was on track, but his termination letter assigned him a "Meets Most Expectations" rating. He said his managers didn't look at the self-review he submitted. "That told me everything. This wasn't about performance," he said. "This was about filling quotas." The manager expressed support for the decision, but said there were constraints around time and communication. In his view, the company culture had grown increasingly cutthroat, with employees clinging to projects to boost their ratings, jockeying within the performance curve, and seeing dissent increasingly punished. "Many people stay because the compensation is hard to walk away from, not because they believe in the mission. I was one of them. It was a place that offered scale and learning, but at a steep emotional cost," he said, adding that his healthy salary would have made him "an easy target" for cost-cutters. An engineer was laid off after five months of leave for a serious health crisis while in the middle of disability-related negotiations. He said his final performance rating — "Meets Most Expectations" — felt like "a scarlet letter." "I wasn't underperforming," he said. Peer reviews before the leave had been entirely positive, and he saved "screenshots of it all for my lawyer." His compensation exceeded $500,000, making him the highest-paid person on the team after his manager. He said he worked 60 to 75 hours before falling ill, but he sensed resentment after raising burnout concerns and stepping away from a major project. "And after the layoff? Nothing. My manager didn't even say goodbye." He said Meta's branding of laid-off workers as low performers "sets a dangerous precedent — companies can quietly rewrite the story of your career, and you don't get to fight back." He's exploring legal options. "Meta is telling one story," he said. "And for many of us, it's not the truth." Have a tip?

Title: Deliveroo deal shows UK still can't hang on to big firms
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgp22d2kexo
Time Published: 2025-05-06T08:00:05Z
Full Content:
The takeover of Deliveroo by its US counterpart DoorDash is an illuminating example of the differing fortunes and attractions of US and UK stock markets. DoorDash's offer for Deliveroo values the business at £2.9bn and will create a company with operations in more than 40 countries. While both are similar companies, their fortunes have dramatically diverged over the past few years. Both started out as food delivery services offering customers convenient and speedy access to their favourite restaurants and offering restaurants the ability to more fully utilise the capacity of their kitchens. Both extended their offerings to include other convenience shopping items – like nappies, flowers and pet food. Both raised money by selling shares to the public in an initial public offering (IPO) around the same time – Deliveroo on the London stock market, DoorDash on the New York Stock Exchange. But when Deliveroo listed its shares in London, DoorDash was worth five times as much as its UK counterpart. Four years later DoorDash was worth 35 times as much. This is not a perfect comparison as DoorDash has issued more shares to raise money to expand over time which would boost its total value – its market capitalisation. But the appetite for shares in the US company meant that it could successfully raise that money on US markets. Let's look at another measure – the price of each share. An investor who bought a share of DoorDash has seen its value rise 84%. An investor who bought a share of Deliveroo has seen its value fall 56%. What this means is that DoorDash is now in a position to use its greater financial heft to take over its UK rival – just as Deliveroo is finally turning a profit. One of Deliveroo's first backers, Danny Rimer of Index Ventures, told the BBC in 2023 that if he had his time again he would have voted for a US listing, and people close to the company agree that the current takeover bid was partly enabled by DoorDash's access to US capital markets. This is just one example which helps explain a wider problem. Companies are increasingly shunning the London stock market in favour of a US listing. There are many reasons. Higher valuation. The 500 largest publicly traded US companies (S&P 500) are worth, on average, 28 times the profit they make in a year. The 100 largest publicly traded UK companies (the FTSE 100) sell for 12 times their yearly earnings. Less than half. How can there be such a huge disparity? Partly because the US is home to most of the world's most successful and profitable companies – the so-called Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) Take those out and shares trade at 20 times earnings – still a massive premium to the UK. One of the other reasons UK valuations lag is old-fashioned lack of demand. UK investors' appetite for UK stocks has shrivelled. Over the last 30 years, the share of the UK market owned by UK financial institutions has shrunk from 50% to less than 5%. This is partly because financial regulation has encouraged pension funds to buy less risky investments like government bonds. But it's also partly because the managers of those pension funds think they will get better returns investing in US markets – and they have been dead right. In just the last five years, the total return including dividends on investing in US shares has been 116% while the same number for the UK is 45%. But there are changes afoot. The government's so-called "Edinburgh Reforms", designed to make listing in the UK more attractive, included reducing the proportion of a company available for sale to the public and retaining more voting power for founders who wanted to keep control of the company even as they sold stakes to others. There have also been positive comments on the attractiveness of the UK from financial giants like Larry Fink of BlackRock and Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan. They both noted the UK looks undervalued and the UK market has outperformed the US so far this year. The secret that UK stocks are cheap has been out there for some time. That is precisely why private buyers from the US and elsewhere have swooped on UK-listed companies meaning they disappear from the UK stock market. Even some of the biggest ones left are considered candidates for a move. Shell boss Wael Sawan told the BBC that while he had "no immediate" plans to move, he and his company "got a very warm welcome" when they held their big reception for investors in New York. Shell trades at a 35% discount to its US-listed peers and many of its shareholders aren't happy about it. What the DoorDash swoop on Deliveroo seems to highlight once again is that companies listed in the US can summon greater financial firepower with which to expand or acquire their rivals. Deliveroo will join the likes of Arm Holdings, Morrisons, CRH Holdings, Ultra, Meggitt and many others as companies who used to be listed on the London Stock Exchange. Does it matter? Pension funds, or individual investors, can buy shares whether they are listed in the UK, US or one of the European exchanges. But a UK listing generates significant ancillary business for a UK financial services industry that still makes up more than 10% of the UK's entire economy and contributes more than 10% of all taxes paid here. Accountants, lawyers, financial PR firms and others feed off the fees that UK listings generate. Trading on the London Stock Exchange is dwarfed by the trading of currencies, bonds and complex contracts but it has always been a centre of gravity for financial activity and one which many argue has lost its power to attract. The deal is the latest example of a UK-listed company being taken over by a US rival. Oury Amadou Diallo, 22, did not have licence for modified bike classed as motorcycle, court hears.
