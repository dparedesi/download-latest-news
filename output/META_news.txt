May 04, 2025 08:47 ET | Source: Nitric Boost Nitric Boost NEW YORK, May 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- If you’re searching for the best nitric oxide supplements for men, you're not alone. In 2025, nitric oxide (NO) boosters are among the most in-demand health products for men looking to enhance blood flow, energy, athletic performance, and even support for erectile dysfunction (ED). But what exactly is nitric oxide, and why does it matter so much? Nitric oxide is a naturally occurring molecule in your body that plays a crucial role in vascular health. It helps relax and dilate blood vessels, allowing for improved circulation—a function that impacts everything from your stamina at the gym to your performance in the bedroom. Unfortunately, as men age, natural NO production declines, often leading to fatigue, reduced endurance, poor muscle recovery, and even symptoms of ED. That’s where nitric oxide supplements come in. Designed to stimulate NO production through ingredients like L-arginine, L-citrulline, and beetroot extract, these supplements help improve oxygen delivery, nutrient flow, and vascular function. Whether you're an athlete chasing better pumps or someone looking to restore youthful energy and performance, the right nitric oxide booster can make a major difference. And among the dozens of options on the market, one supplement continues to lead the pack in 2025… Enter: Nitric Boost Ultra — a cutting-edge NO supplement formulated for maximum blood flow, energy, and erectile support. This guide explores the science behind nitric oxide, the benefits it delivers for men’s health, and why Nitric Boost Ultra stands out as the best nitric oxide supplement for energy, endurance, and ED support this year. Meet Nitric Boost Ultra – The Best Nitric Oxide Supplement for Men When it comes to choosing the best nitric oxide supplement for men, Nitric Boost Ultra consistently ranks as the top choice in 2025. This advanced formula is specifically engineered to support optimal blood flow, muscle pumps, stamina, and erectile health — making it a powerful ally for any man looking to reclaim energy, confidence, and vitality. Why Nitric Boost Ultra Stands Out Unlike generic NO boosters, Nitric Boost Ultra goes beyond basic L-arginine formulas. It’s designed with a synergistic blend of science-backed ingredients that work together to enhance nitric oxide production, increase oxygen delivery, and improve vascular performance without the crash or jitteriness often associated with stimulant-heavy products. Key Benefits at a Glance: Who It’s For: Nitric Boost Ultra is ideal for: Whether your goals are better performance in the gym, the bedroom, or day-to-day life, Nitric Boost Ultra delivers noticeable results — quickly and without side effects. Ingredients in Nitric Boost Ultra – Why They Matter What sets Nitric Boost Ultra apart from the rest of the best nitric oxide supplements for men is its clean, clinically-informed formula that zeroes in on blood flow, stamina, and vascular performance. Each ingredient has a specific role in increasing nitric oxide levels, improving erectile function, and enhancing overall male vitality. L-Arginine Alpha-Ketoglutarate (AAKG) Primary Function: Boosts nitric oxide synthesisAAKG is a potent form of L-arginine combined with alpha-ketoglutarate, allowing for better absorption and sustained nitric oxide production. It helps dilate blood vessels, improve circulation, and promote stronger erections and muscle pumps. L-Citrulline Malate Primary Function: Extends nitric oxide boost durationL-Citrulline converts to L-arginine in the body and provides a longer-lasting nitric oxide effect. It’s known to improve exercise endurance, reduce fatigue, and enhance erectile performance by promoting better blood flow to sensitive areas. Beet Root Extract Primary Function: Natural source of dietary nitratesBeets are rich in nitrates, which the body converts into nitric oxide. Beetroot extract supports cardiovascular health, reduces blood pressure, and enhances stamina, making it a key ingredient for both gym-goers and those seeking better sexual performance. Tribulus Terrestris Primary Function: Supports testosterone and libidoThis herbal extract may help boost natural testosterone levels, which can enhance libido, energy, and muscle strength. When paired with improved blood flow, it amplifies both sexual and athletic performance. Pine Bark Extract (Pycnogenol) Primary Function: Enhances nitric oxide retentionKnown for its antioxidant properties, pine bark extract helps sustain nitric oxide levels in the blood longer, leading to better vascular tone, improved erectile quality, and faster post-exercise recovery. Niacin (Vitamin B3) Primary Function: Improves blood vessel flexibilityNiacin supports vascular health by reducing inflammation and improving blood lipid profiles. It works synergistically with the other ingredients to optimize circulation and reduce fatigue. Why This Blend Works: This unique combination addresses every aspect of nitric oxide production and utilization — from boosting initial levels to sustaining them longer and improving blood vessel responsiveness. Whether you’re battling low energy, erectile dysfunction, or sluggish recovery, Nitric Boost Ultra helps restore male performance at its core.

Try it today! How Nitric Oxide Works – The Science Behind NO Boosters Nitric oxide (NO) is a naturally occurring molecule in the human body, essential for many physiological processes — especially those tied to circulation, energy, and male performance. Understanding how nitric oxide works helps explain why supplements like Nitric Boost Ultra have become the go-to solution for men looking to improve stamina, blood flow, and even erectile dysfunction (ED). What Is Nitric Oxide (NO)? Nitric oxide is a vasodilator — a compound that signals blood vessels to relax and widen. This increased vessel diameter allows more blood, oxygen, and nutrients to flow to vital areas of the body. NO is synthesized from amino acids like L-Arginine and L-Citrulline and is crucial for: How Nitric Oxide Boosters Work Nitric oxide supplements — like Nitric Boost Ultra — work by supplying the body with precursors that stimulate NO production naturally. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works: 1. L-Arginine & L-Citrulline These amino acids are converted into nitric oxide via the endothelial cells lining your blood vessels. This process leads to: 2. Beet Root & Other Plant-Based Boosters Beetroot is rich in nitrates, which convert into nitric oxide through a different pathway — the nitrate-nitrite-NO cycle. This dual approach provides: 3. Synergistic Support from Key Vitamins & Botanicals Ingredients like Niacin (Vitamin B3) help relax blood vessels and improve lipid profiles, while herbs like Tribulus Terrestris and Pine Bark Extract boost natural testosterone and enhance libido — making NO boosters even more effective for male sexual health. Fast-Acting, Long-Lasting Results Once taken, NO boosters quickly absorb into the bloodstream and start enhancing circulation within hours. Over time, consistent use: Nitric Boost Ultra works on all these mechanisms, making it one of the top-rated nitric oxide supplements for men who want to optimize blood flow, muscle function, and sexual performance without pharmaceuticals or side effects. Clinical Studies Supporting Nitric Oxide Supplementation 1. L-Citrulline and Erectile Function A study published in Urology investigated the effects of oral L-citrulline supplementation on men with mild erectile dysfunction (ED). In this single-blind study, participants received a placebo for one month followed by L-citrulline (1.5 g/day) for another month. The results showed that 50% of the men experienced an improvement in erection hardness from a score of 3 (mild ED) to 4 (normal erectile function) during the L-citrulline phase, compared to only 8.3% during the placebo phase. Additionally, the mean number of intercourses per month increased significantly with L-citrulline supplementation. Another study explored the combination of L-citrulline and transresveratrol in men with ED who were already using phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i). This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover pilot study found that the combination therapy significantly improved erectile function compared to placebo, suggesting a potential synergistic effect. 2. Beetroot Juice and Blood Pressure A systematic review and meta-analysis examined the impact of nitrate-rich beetroot juice on blood pressure in individuals with arterial hypertension. The analysis included seven studies with a total of 218 participants. The findings indicated that beetroot juice supplementation led to a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) by approximately 4.95 mmHg. However, the effect on diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was not statistically significant. Another study focused on the acute and short-term effects of nitrate-rich beetroot juice ingestion in postmenopausal women with arterial hypertension. The results demonstrated that both acute and one-week supplementation enhanced cardiovascular responses following aerobic exercise, highlighting the potential benefits of beetroot juice in this population. Nitric Boost Ultra vs Other Top Nitric Oxide Supplements When it comes to nitric oxide supplements, not all formulas are created equal. While many products claim to boost nitric oxide levels, only a few deliver clinically effective doses, proven ingredients, and measurable results. Here's how Nitric Boost Ultra compares head-to-head with other top-rated nitric oxide boosters in the market. Ingredients & Clinical Doses Nitric Boost Ultra stands out for including clinically validated doses of L-Arginine and L-Citrulline, the two most important amino acids involved in nitric oxide synthesis. Unlike other products that use proprietary blends or underdose key ingredients, Nitric Boost Ultra clearly lists: Most competitors—like SuperBeets or Neo40—rely heavily on beetroot alone, without the dual-action benefits of arginine + citrulline. Pre-workout formulas like N.O. XT may include these aminos but often at lower or less bioavailable doses. Delivery Method Nitric Boost Ultra is delivered in easy-to-swallow capsules, optimized for gradual absorption and longer-lasting effects. This method avoids the rapid spike and crash often experienced with lozenges, powders, or sugary beet-based drinks. Nitric Boost Ultra's capsule format ensures no mess, no mixing, and no blood sugar spikes—just smooth, consistent nitric oxide support throughout the day. Third-Party Testing & Purity Purity and transparency are key when choosing a top nitric oxide booster. Nitric Boost Ultra is: Many other brands skip third-party testing or hide their ingredient doses behind proprietary blends. With Nitric Boost Ultra, what you see is what you get—no fillers, no gimmicks. Price vs. Value While some nitric oxide supplements may seem cheaper upfront, they often cut corners on ingredient quality or dosing. Nitric Boost Ultra offers premium ingredients, clinical dosing, and a comprehensive formula that supports: And all of this is backed by a 60-day money-back guarantee—making it a risk-free investment in your health. Bottom Line: Why Nitric Boost Ultra Leads the Pack If you’re seeking the best nitric oxide supplement for men’s health, especially for ED support, energy, and peak performance, Nitric Boost Ultra delivers where others fall short. With clinical dosing, clean formulation, and proven ingredients, it’s engineered for real results—not just hype. Order Nitric Boost Ultra now and experience the nitric oxide difference Health Benefits of Nitric Oxide Supplements for Men When it comes to men’s health, few compounds are as impactful as nitric oxide (NO).

Feel stronger, think clearer, and live better — take charge of your health with Nitric Boost Ultra today. Nitric Oxide Benefits for Males – Why It Matters Most After 40 As men age, their bodies experience a gradual decline in nitric oxide (NO) production — a key molecule that affects everything from blood circulation to sexual health, muscle performance, and even heart function. By the time you reach 40 and beyond, this drop in NO can begin to show up in ways that directly impact your quality of life. That’s where nitric oxide supplements like Nitric Boost Ultra come in. These boosters are specifically designed to replenish NO levels and restore youthful performance across multiple health areas. 1. Improved Erectile Function and Sexual Vitality One of the most talked-about nitric oxide benefits for males is its direct link to stronger, longer-lasting erections. NO relaxes blood vessels and improves blood flow — a critical factor in achieving and maintaining erections. Men over 40 often experience ED or performance issues not due to lack of desire, but because blood flow is compromised. A high-quality nitric oxide booster for ED, such as Nitric Boost Ultra: This makes nitric oxide one of the best natural alternatives to ED medications — without harsh side effects. 2. Cardiovascular Health and Blood Pressure Support After 40, men are more susceptible to hypertension, heart disease, and circulatory issues. Since nitric oxide plays a key role in vasodilation (the widening of blood vessels), boosting NO levels can: Regular use of nitric oxide supplements has been associated with better heart performance and lower vascular resistance, helping you age with strength and resilience. 3. Enhanced Physical Performance and Muscle Recovery Whether you’re staying fit or just trying to keep up with your kids, muscle fatigue becomes more noticeable after 40. Nitric oxide helps: By improving circulation and oxygen delivery, NO boosters like Nitric Boost Ultra are perfect for maintaining strength and physical ability well into your 40s, 50s, and beyond. 4. Cognitive Function and Mental Sharpness The gut-brain axis and circulatory function also play a huge role in how you think and feel. As NO supports blood flow to the brain, it can improve: This is particularly helpful for aging men juggling careers, families, and health — NO supplements are a hidden gem in natural cognitive support. 5. Energy and Anti-Aging Effects Fatigue and slowed metabolism are common complaints after 40. By supporting mitochondrial efficiency and cellular energy production, nitric oxide helps: The anti-aging effects of nitric oxide go beyond the surface — they’re about staying functional, vibrant, and energized every single day. Why Nitric Boost Ultra Is Ideal for Men 40+ What makes Nitric Boost Ultra a standout choice for men over 40 is its clean, high-impact formulation: Nitric Oxide Side Effects – What You Should Know Before Taking a NO Booster As nitric oxide supplements like Nitric Boost Ultra continue gaining popularity for blood flow support, workout enhancement, and ED relief, it’s essential to understand the potential side effects and how to use them safely. While most people tolerate nitric oxide boosters well, being informed ensures you can maximize the benefits without unwanted surprises. Are There Any Common Side Effects? Generally, natural nitric oxide supplements are considered safe for healthy adults when taken as directed. However, some individuals may experience mild side effects, particularly when first starting or when taking high doses. Possible side effects may include: These effects are usually temporary and tend to subside as the body adjusts. What Causes These Side Effects? Most side effects stem from the vasodilation process, where blood vessels widen due to increased nitric oxide. This can lead to changes in blood pressure or temporary shifts in circulation. Stimulant-free formulas like Nitric Boost Ultra, which uses natural vasodilators (L-arginine, beetroot, pine bark), are generally easier on the body compared to synthetic or caffeine-loaded options. How to Minimize Risk To enjoy the benefits of nitric oxide safely, follow these guidelines: If you have a pre-existing heart condition or are on blood pressure medications, consult a physician before starting any nitric oxide booster. Who Should Be Cautious? Although NO supplements for men offer amazing benefits, they may not be suitable for: Nitric Boost Ultra is non-GMO, gluten-free, soy-free, and made with clinically backed ingredients, which significantly reduces the risk of allergic reactions or sensitivities.

Title: GoDaddy CEO: Focus On Innovation and Customers and The Rest Takes Care of Itself
URL: https://www.webpronews.com/godaddy-ceo-focus-on-innovation-and-customers-and-the-rest-takes-care-of-itself/
Time Published: 2025-05-04T10:04:30Z
Full Content:
In a climate of growing scrutiny over digital businesses, GoDaddy Inc. delivered what CEO Aman Bhutani described as “a very strong quarter,” posting results that beat Wall Street forecasts on both the top and bottom line for its first quarter of 2024. Yet, despite the solid quarterly performance and reaffirmed full-year outlook, concerns persist among investors and analysts about the sustainability of GoDaddy’s growth, especially against a backcloth of economic headwinds and wavering consumer sentiment. “We beat across all financial metrics in Q1. So a very strong quarter for us. And we reaffirmed our full-year guidance,” Bhutani told CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” in an exclusive interview. “Our customers are resilient. Our business is durable. I’ve never been more excited about being at GoDaddy.” GoDaddy’s financial highlights for the quarter included better-than-expected revenue and earnings per share, supported by ongoing demand for the company’s suite of digital tools enabling small businesses and entrepreneurs to establish an online presence. But the company’s shares have come under pressure, sliding in the wake of the report as market participants voiced concerns about underlying trends in customer growth and dependency on price hikes for revenue expansion. Analyst Queries Over Customer Dynamics A number of analysts questioned the optics around declining customer counts and whether increases in average order size or “attach rate”—the number of products per customer—can sustainably drive revenue growth in a competitive and sensitive marketplace. “One analyst has pointed out that the optics are that customer count is coming down. There’s a narrative out there that price drove most of the growth in 2024. And there are questions about whether it’s sustainable this year,” said CNBC host John Fortt. Bhutani responded by shifting the focus from absolute customer numbers to the quality and depth of GoDaddy’s customer relationships. “The idea is to bring high intent customers to GoDaddy, not folks who are looking to buy a cheap domain and then not renew or buy any of our other products,” he said. “We’ve really expanded the product suite over the last few years. We want customers that want to use the breadth of products, and that’s what we’re seeing. We’re seeing increased average order size, improved retention rates, and customers using more of our products.” GoDaddy has been investing in product innovation, including the recent launch of Aero, an AI-powered solution designed to help clients quickly access the full spectrum of GoDaddy’s offerings, from domain registration and website design to e-commerce, digital marketing, and payments. Small Businesses: A Barometer for Economic Mood As a linchpin for millions of small business owners and entrepreneurs, GoDaddy’s performance provides a unique window into the mindset of Main Street businesses—often the first to feel the chill of a softening economy but also the first to rebound when optimism returns. The company conducts regular surveys with its customer base, which Bhutani said gives the company “real-time” insight. “There’s a little bit more tentativeness from our customers on the broader economy. But the core story has not changed, and that story is about our customer being resilient,” Bhutani said. “When we ask them about the economy, yes, they’re a little more concerned, but when we ask them about their business, the majority of them continue to be very bullish about their business.” Industry observers note that GoDaddy operates at a critical juncture for small businesses, many of which rely on the company’s low-cost and essential digital infrastructure. “Our customers need us most for marketing,” Bhutani explained. “A domain name, a website, a little email solution, or just a link to take payments…these are the solutions that are going to be the last things customers give up.” That stickiness, he argued, works in GoDaddy’s favor even in downturns. “Even when a business goes down, a customer doesn’t get rid of their domain name. They’re not giving up the dream,” Bhutani said. “They’re going to keep going and try it again or try something different.” Competitive Positioning Amid Digital Heavyweights Even as GoDaddy faces its usual competition from hosting and web development rivals, broader industry trends are shaping its trajectory. The digital tools segment has been lifted by surging demand for online marketing and commerce solutions; tech giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google reported robust advertising growth in their latest quarters, reflecting businesses’ increased willingness to optimize digital spending, even amid economic uncertainty. Amazon’s advertising revenue, for instance, rose 90% year-over-year. Asked how GoDaddy fits into this bigger digital transformation, Bhutani outlined an effort to expand beyond core domain registration into “marketing solutions and commerce solutions.” The company’s newest products are designed to capture a greater share of its customers’ digital spending, with lower overall prices and added value for switching or consolidating services. “We’ve got more and more offerings like marketing solutions and commerce solutions as well,” Bhutani said, hinting at a strategy to position GoDaddy not simply as a domain registrar, but as a one-stop digital partner for small businesses. Stock Under Pressure, But Focus Remains on Execution Despite the strategic narrative and the company’s recent investments, GoDaddy stock remains under pressure. Analysts appear unconvinced that product attach and average revenue per user will be enough to drive sustained growth in the event of waning new customer acquisitions—especially in a challenging macroeconomic environment. Bhutani, for his part, remains focused on execution. “My view is let’s focus on the things that we do. Let’s focus on the innovation. Let’s focus on serving our customers. And the rest takes care of itself,” he concluded. He maintains confidence that share price will eventually reflect what the company sees as underlying business strength and resiliency among its core customer base. For now, GoDaddy will be measured less by the hype that once defined the digital domain industry and more by its ability to deepen and lengthen relationships with existing clients—many of whom, in Bhutani’s words, are “not giving up the dream” even in challenging times.

May 03, 2025 09:22 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, May 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads. Following the release of these reports, the price of AppLovin shares reportedly fell by more than 12%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the claims. “The allegations detailed in the short reports and outlined in the recently filed class action complaint, detailing the purported exploitation of user data and manipulative installation schemes, raise serious questions about the integrity of AppLovin's reported growth and the accuracy of its disclosures to the investing public,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

A major additional driver for the stock was the company’s foray into the data centre business, though the segment itself is yet to contribute significantly to overall revenues. After a relentless run, the stock is down over 50 per cent from its recent peak in January. While the correction in the broader markets triggered by FPI selling, corporate earnings weakness and US trade tariff challenges led to an up to 25 per cent correction in mid- and small-cap indices, some stocks in this space suffered a lot more. There was also excessive pessimism on the prospects of the nascent cloud/storage business of the company after the DeepSeek AI announcement led to fears that data centre capex the world over would face a reduction (this aspect will be discussed later). At ₹450, the stock trades at 25 times its per share earnings for FY26, making it a reasonable bet for investors with a two-three-year perspective, especially given the elevated valuations that most of the relatively-larger real estate companies trade at currently. The BSE Realty trades at a PE multiple of over 48 times. Robust traction in its residential construction business spanning luxury and affordable segments, visibility in its commercial division and healthy demand in its data centre offering, expected to start contributing to revenues significantly in the coming two-three years, are positive factors. The company also has a healthy balance sheet with very insignificant net debt levels. Over FY21-25, Anant Raj’s revenues grew at 69.4 per cent compounded annually to ₹2,060 crore, while net profits rose at 149.5 per cent to ₹426 crore in FY25. Revenue grew at 38.9 per cent and net profit expanded at 60.1 per cent year on year in FY25. The firm is largely a real estate player focused on the NCR region (mostly in Gurugram). Residential luxury projects, group housing, affordable housing (in Tirupati), plots and villas are areas that it specialises in. There are projects spanning 220 acres of integrated development in Gurugram. About 10.87 million sq ft of ongoing and planned projects are on the horizon, with a total expected revenue of ₹22,000 crore over the next several years. Since it operates in a high-end area of Gurugram, realisations on residential projects are high. In its group housing project, for example, the average selling price is ₹18,000 per sq ft. Anant Raj also has a commercial spaces segment spanning hotels, IT parks and office spaces. These businesses have steady rental income visibility for the foreseeable future. Anant Raj has been providing co-location services since 2019. In recent years, it has also started offering cloud services (infrastructure as a service) in association with Orange Business. It intends to get into AI-enabled solutions as well. By Q1FY26, the company expects as much as 28 MW of data centre capacity to be operational. Over the next five-odd years, it expects to have over 300 MW up and running. Revenues from the segment are insignificant currently. However, after the 28 MW capacity gets operationalised, the data centre segment may contribute significantly (more than 10 per cent) of the revenues by FY26. Over the next two-three years, as more capacity comes on stream, about 25-30 per cent of the company’s revenues may be generated from the segment. The key aspect to note here is that the data centre business generates an operating margin of 75 per cent or more. So, when more revenues flow in, company margins would expand. Anant Raj mostly had public sector companies as clients in its data centre business thus far, but increasingly even private firms are seeking its cloud services. Rising e-commerce usage, faster 5G rollout, cloud computing explosion and data protection law compliance are growth triggers for the company. AI and machine learning would be future drivers. Anant Raj has the added advantage of having its own real estate to house data centres by virtue of its large land bank. India’s data centre capacity crossed 1 GW in 2024, according to a recent report from JLL India, tripling from 2019-levels. Much of the capacity is absorbed. Another 795 MW is expected to be added over 2025-27. Average rents per kVA per month for a 5-20 MW capacity data centre are ₹7,000 in Mumbai. One MW is 1,000 kVA. According to another Anarock Capital report, the Indian data centre industry is worth $10 billion currently and generated an estimated $1.2 billion for operators in 2023-24. On DeepSeek’s entry reducing data centre requirements due to lower computational infrastructure requirements to train large language models, a recent report from Goldman Sachs provides clarity. It notes that questions remain on DeepSeek’s training, infrastructure and ability to scale. The report notes that AI-dedicated data centre is an emerging class of infrastructure and that very few exist currently. Global power demand from data centres will increase 50 per cent by 2027 and by as much as 165 per cent by the end of the decade (compared with 2023), as per Goldman Sachs Research estimates. Further, recently-reported March quarter results and CY26 outlook from US Big Tech companies — Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Amazon also confirm this. Their CY26 mega capex plans related to AI data centre/cloud remains intact, as customer demand remains strong in this segment. Anant Raj has been reducing debt in its balance sheet steadily over the past few years. In FY25, its net debt is just ₹50 crore and the net debt-to-equity ratio is insignificant. The company enjoys a high EBITDA margin of 25 per cent and a net margin of over 20 per cent, which compares favourably among the best in the industry. Once the high-margin data centre business starts contributing significantly to the financials from FY26, margins would further head north.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MAY 03 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market.

Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations.

Title: S&P 500 Notches Longest Winning Streak Since 2004 As Stocks Claw Back From ‘Liberation Day’ Crash

Stocks rallied again Friday on a key data point showing strength in the U.S. economy and optimism about trade talks between the U.S. and China, sending the S&P 500 index to its longest winning stretch in two decades, completing the v-shaped recovery from President Donald Trump’s tariffs which briefly crashed U.S. stocks. The AI trade is back in vogue, with the likes of Meta, Palantir and Tesla all gaining at least 20% ... More since last Monday. The S&P rose 1.5% to 5,686 Friday after April’s jobs report revealed better jobs growth than economists forecasted and Beijing indicated it’s open to addressing Trump’s concerns on the country’s role in fentanyl production, opening a potential path to a trade deal with the White House, according to the Wall Street Journal. This was the ninth consecutive positive trading session for the S&P, the longest winning streak for the benchmark since November 2004, according to Barron’s. Following the end-of-week rally, the S&P closed at its highest price since March 28, a week before President Donald Trump announced country-by-country tariff rates in his so-called “Liberation Day” event April 2. The S&P plummeted more than 12% from April 2 to April 8, but stocks have steadily recovered since Trump paused his most hawkish trade policies April 9 and his administration further backed down on tariffs in the following weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and tech-heavy Nasdaq also gained more than 1% Friday and are up big from their tariff-driven April lows, as the Dow is up 10%, or more than 3,600 points, since April 8 and the Nasdaq is up 18% during the time frame. Among the most notable risers Friday were Spotify, Delta Air Lines, Arm Holdings and Palantir, as shares of all four companies gained at least 5%; also jumping were Facebook parent Meta and Microsoft, which both enjoyed more than 2% bumps as a continuation of their rallies following robust earnings reports Tuesday. The S&P is still down 7% from its February record high and 5% since Trump’s second presidency began. The stock market yardstick suffered its worst 100-day start to a presidential term since Richard Nixon’s second term in 1973, according to the Wall Street Journal. “If the labor market holds up and the Trump administration walks back the most egregious tariffs, the economy could skirt a deep recession,” LPL Financial chief economist Jeffrey Roach in emailed comments. About 90% of the 500 companies listed on the S&P have gained during the winning streak stretching back to last Tuesday. The top percentage gainers are all artificial intelligence players: AI-focused government contractor Palantir, AI hardware maker Arista Networks and AI data center power provider Vistra. Among the U.S.’ three dozen “mega-cap” companies valued at $200 billion and above, the biggest winners are Palantir, Elon Musk’s Tesla and Larry Ellison’s cloud computer Oracle. Shares of both Meta and Microsoft have also gained more than 20%. Not taking part in the Friday rally was Apple, as shares of the iPhone maker slid 4%. The big technology firm reported first-quarter earnings Thursday afternoon and nodded to the damaging effects of tariffs to its bottom line, warning of a $900 million direct profit hit from tariffs. A slew of companies have lowered or suspended financial guidance in light of tariff uncertainty. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

May 02, 2025 13:59 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, May 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in AppLovin Corporation ("AppLovin" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: APP) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of AppLovin investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 10, 2023 and March 26, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/applovin-corporation-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=146419&wire=3 APP investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in AppLovin during the relevant time frame, you have until May 5, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate. WHY LEVI & KORSINSKY: Over the past 20 years, the team at Levi & Korsinsky has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders and built a track record of winning high-stakes cases.

Title: Meta Says Its Numbers Show that AI Spending Is Paying Off

Meta (META) plans to boost its spending on AI. That didn't cool enthusiasm for the social media giant's stock. Shares of the Facebook parent surged more than 4% to just over $572 Thursday after the social media giant a day earlier eported better-than-expected quarterly results and pointed to growth in advertising—which accounts for the bulk of Meta's revenue—aided by its investments in AI. The reaction marks a departure from the same time last year, when shares had tumbled after Meta said it planned to spend more on AI, amid worries about whether the spending would be justified. “AI has already made us better at targeting and finding the audiences that will be interested in their products than many businesses are themselves, and that keeps improving,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors during Wednesday’s earnings call. People are spending more time on Meta’s apps as a result of improvements to its recommendation systems, Zuckerberg said, with users now spending 7% more time on Facebook. Instagram saw a 6% jump. Time on Threads—which launched in 2023—jumped 35% as users also grew. Analysts—including those from Citi, JPMorgan, Wedbush, and Jefferies—raised their price targets for the stock Thursday, pointing to Meta's engagement and targeting gains. Analysts from Bank of America bumped their target to $690 from $640, citing Meta's “tangible business results” from AI. Morgan Stanley analysts, who raised their target to $650 from $615 said Meta’s “best in class and still improving ad product and relative [return on investment] are delivering results.” “Even with our significant investments, we don't need to succeed in all of these areas to have a good ROI," Zuckerberg said during Wednesday call. “But if we do, then I think that we will be wildly happy with the investments that we are making.”

Title: The 30s (in the weather and the polls), K.M.’s investment meetings, the high-profile guest from the Emirates, and the BOAK contract signings

– Hello, happy new month and enjoy the break to those of you who are in the middle of a long weekend — it looks like there are quite a few of you. Besides, the weather’s improving a lot starting tomorrow, and next week we’re heading for proper summer heat. I mention it because my source at M.M. jokingly said yesterday: “Let the temperature hit the 30s, so we can hit the 30s in the polls too.” Before I get into current affairs, let me make a quick — and timely — comment triggered by the violent incidents at the Law School, where some thugs attacked professors and students in a lecture hall. I heard Chrysochoidis on TV yesterday say that since 2021 there’s been a law requiring university administrations to control who comes in and out of campuses, but it’s just not being enforced. So now I ask, seriously — who enforces the laws (or doesn’t)? The government, or… my uncle? So basically, what we’ve got is that no one is really pushing rectors to do their jobs (most of them, anyway), and the government still doesn’t seem interested in putting an end to this outrageous, globally unheard-of situation that I’m struggling to find happening anywhere else! K.M – Investors – So, moving on to other current matters, yesterday was quite a productive day for M.M. since K.M. went in the morning to meet with the heads of CVC at a conference held in Athens. This major American fund used to hold its annual gathering in a different country each year, but last year they went nuts over Athens and the Four Seasons in Vouliagmeni — so they came back again this year. Now, I don’t know exactly what was discussed with Mitsotakis, but CVC does have business interests in Greece and continues to be very bullish on investing here. Livanios – Papastergiou – Yesterday, there was a meeting at M.M. ahead of the announcement of the citizen-led evaluation of public services, which kicks off next week. Present at the meeting were Theodoros Livanios and Dimitris Papastergiou, the two ministers responsible for unveiling the evaluation platform next Tuesday. There’s a chance Kyriakos Mitsotakis will attend the press event himself, as he wanted a technical briefing on the system’s readiness. The government sees this evaluation as a major “poll” on how citizens view public services — and clearly as a “magnifying glass” on the problems. Meetings between the Sultan and Government/Business Figures – Today, K.M. will continue his meetings with major foreign investment players as he’s scheduled to meet at M.M. with Al Jaber, the UAE’s Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology — and as you know, the Emirates have large-scale investments in Greece (TERNA Energy, HHG). Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, Chairman of Masdar, CEO of ADNOC Group, and Executive Chairman of XRG — and Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology of the UAE — is expected to meet not only the Prime Minister but also Deputy PM Kostis Hatzidakis. Two months ago, K. Mitsotakis visited Abu Dhabi as part of efforts to deepen the strategic bilateral ties established in 2020, which were followed in 2022 by the Strategic Investment Cooperation Agreement between the Hellenic Development Bank of Investments and ADQ, the UAE’s sovereign fund. Later today, Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber will visit the HQ of TERNA Energy, which is now part of the Masdar Group, accompanied by Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, CEO of the UAE energy giant. Masdar, which finalized its €3.2 billion acquisition of 100% of TERNA Energy just weeks ago — one of the largest renewables deals in Europe — plans to build a massive 10 GW portfolio across Greece and abroad by 2030. The Arab company will provide funding and international expertise to boost TERNA Energy’s growth and help it meet the target of 6 GW of installed renewable capacity by 2029. Also on the agenda are one-on-one meetings at a central Athens hotel with several ministers and Greek entrepreneurs. Presentation on Juvenile Violence – Next Monday morning, the postponed presentation of the National Strategy for the prevention of violence and juvenile delinquency will take place at M.M. The plan has been put together by Skertsos’ team along with a team of experts led by Professor Vasso Artinopoulou. Right after the presentation, a press conference will be held at the General Secretariat of Information by the relevant ministers to present the new policies and measures of the national strategy, with a horizon extending to 2030. Kostis Staying Put – Elections may still be a ways off, but the creative scenarios have already started flying — about constituencies and such. Some say that Kostis Hatzidakis won’t run in the Northern Sector of Athens B and will instead go on the ND’s national party list. However, I spoke with the Deputy Prime Minister himself, who flat-out denies this and confirms he’s staying in the North, where he was (by far) the top vote-getter in both 2023 and 2019. Leventopaido Aristo, step inside the shop and shut it down – On April 29, the Hellenic Capital Market Commission announced the imposition of fines on four companies for violating paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 9 of decision 1/506/8.4.2009 of the Commission, due to the late submission of their external auditors’ reports on the adequacy and effectiveness of procedures to prevent money laundering. In plain Greek: the companies were fined for missing deadlines and compliance steps to prevent money laundering. One of them — which got the largest fine — was “OPENFUND AEDAKES.” The representative of OPENFUND is Aristidis (Aristos) Doxiadis, a social scientist and economist, Vice President of the National Council for Research and Innovation, and for exactly 32 hours, Deputy Minister of Innovation. For a Harvard graduate — whose motto, by the way, is the Latin word for “truth” — Aristo Doxiadis hasn’t been doing so hot lately. First, he forgot some debts to the state, and now he’s missed the anti-money-laundering deadlines too. Executive Moves – Nikolas Valantasis has joined the investment banking division of Euroxx. The market knows him from his last role as Deputy CEO of the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund, but before the HFSF, Valantasis had a 20-year career both in Greece and abroad with Mckinsey, Citigroup, Eurobank, and Barclays. BOAK Contract Signings – Next week — barring any surprises — the contracts for the Northern Road Axis of Crete (BOAK) project are expected to be signed, specifically for the Chania–Heraklion section. The budget is €2 billion, and with the other two sections included, the total budget reaches €4.5 billion. It’s a construction-concession project with complex requirements, as construction and operation will happen simultaneously. Generally, the most interesting business developments will begin once the contract is signed. Qualco Knocks on the Stock Exchange Door – The increased market volatility didn’t faze Orestis Tsakalotos, and Qualco is preparing to enter the Athens Stock Exchange in the first half of May. The company, which provides tech solutions for the credit sector, has a 25-year history and a presence in 30 countries across Europe and the Middle East. Through its public offering for the main market listing, it aims to raise up to €70 million, mostly to fund acquisitions. The Stock Market Climbs the Wall of Worry – After the three-day sell-off triggered by Trump’s tariffs in early April, it was hard to imagine that the month would end with a positive outcome for the Athens Stock Exchange. The General Index hit its lowest point (1,455 points) on April 7, falling at least 200 points from the March close (1,685 points). However, the comeback came soon after, with some ups and downs, but also several daily “leaps” that brought the General Index back to the 1,700-point range. This marked the sixth consecutive month of growth, a streak not seen since the profitable seven-month period between January and July of 2019. If the market moves contrary to the famous stock market saying “sell in May and go away” and especially against the worsened macroeconomic data from the U.S. economy, the aforementioned rally might be leveled out. In large part, the course of the Athens Stock Exchange will be determined by foreign trends, although May has certain milestones of Greek interest, such as bank results, which – according to market information and estimates – will show stability, as the reduction in euro interest rates was accompanied by an increase in lending – mainly to businesses but also individuals. We also have the Fitch rating on the 16th of the month and the Scope rating on May 30. Nevertheless, most analysts believe that the 1,750-point mark is hard to surpass unless there are significant economic and business events. This is why the last few sessions have been characterized by caution and rushed moves. Yesterday, only the stock exchanges of London and New York were open due to May Day, with relatively low trading volumes. Which Stocks Played Defense – Despite the aftershocks from the contraction of the U.S. GDP, some “heavy hitters” played defense, staying on an upward trajectory and even setting new records. First and foremost, Coca-Cola HBC closed above €45 for the first time ever, propelled by the strong Q1 results. The rise for OPAP and OTE was “quiet,” but enough to push them to 16-year and 3-year highs, respectively. Sarantis hit a 7-year record, trading today without the right to the €0.299 dividend per share. Meanwhile, buyers continued to place bets on the stocks of the two port authorities. Piraeus Port is very close to breaking the €40 mark, while Thessaloniki Port finished Wednesday’s session at its highest point in 17 years. The First by Spyros Theodoropoulos – The president of SEV, Spyros Theodoropoulos, is reintroducing the institution of regular press conferences to “communicate” the views of employers representing a capital of €416 billion and declaring taxable profits of €14 billion. Next Wednesday, SEV will hold its first press conference at its headquarters on Xenofontos Street. Already, the initiative of SEV’s President to unite and activate entrepreneurs in the broader “defense” sector led to the first productive meeting with the Prime Minister and government officials. Tête-à-Tête Between Theodorikakos and Supermarket Owners – The two-month extension of the regime with the cap on profit margins, which the government decided on Wednesday, shows its willingness to end this measure. Minister Theodorikakos promised the Prime Minister a new, more modern framework for price control (a bill is being prepared) and stricter enforcement of anti-profiteering fines. Before making this decision, the Minister of Development met with representatives of the Food Industry, and today, Friday, he will meet with supermarket owners. The cap is coming to an end. But not today. From summer… The Headaches of the German Debt Agency – The German public debt does not exceed 63% of GDP, but the new ambitious defense program of the Merz government will require increased borrowing. The German Debt Agency (Deutsche Finanzagentur DFA) plans to issue 50-year bonds for the first time, and has already announced the issuance of 30-year bonds worth €26 billion for 2025, along with other 20-year and 10-year Bunds. Recently, the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) boldly issued a further 100-year bond to cover its needs, and the markets responded with an interest rate below 2%. The discussion around a 50-year Bund (government bond) – following in the footsteps of France – has already raised yields on euro swaps. The difference between the 50-year and 30-year German SWAP has risen sharply to a new multi-year high. The Discussion on Elon Musk’s Departure from TESLA – Everything started from a report by the Wall Street Journal, which stated that “tensions had increased” at Tesla when the board started looking for a successor to Elon Musk. Tesla officially and categorically denied the rumors about Musk stepping down as CEO. The company’s chairperson, Robyn Denholm, stated that there had been no contact with headhunters for a replacement, despite rumors that the board had considered this possibility due to concerns about the time Musk is dedicating to his governmental duties. Since mid-December 2024, the stock price has fallen by around -48% from the historic high of $488.54, and so far in 2025, it has recorded a decline of around -40%. Today, at $283, Tesla is worth about $908 billion, having quintupled its market value in the last 5 years. Musk denies that he will resign from the ambitious DOGE plan, while some analysts believe a “graceful exit” to the chairmanship of the Board of Directors could be a possibility. Mark Zuckerberg’s Promises to Facebook Shareholders – Microsoft and Meta Platforms announced great results for Q1 2025, but times on Wall Street have changed. Analysts no longer focus on the past but primarily on the future, particularly capital expenditures related to artificial intelligence projects. Microsoft reported capital expenditures of $16.7 billion in Q1. Meta, Mark Zuckerberg’s company, stated it would invest between $64 and $72 billion in capex annually. Interestingly, CEO Mark Zuckerberg began his presentation to analysts with a promise of future returns on all this capital investment in 5 key areas: “Improved advertising, more attractive experiences, business messaging, new Meta AI devices, and more Artificial Intelligence. These are long-term investments to create top-tier AI models and infrastructures. Even with our significant investments, we don’t need to succeed in all these areas to have a good return on investment (ROI).” “The pace of progress across the industry and the opportunities ahead of us are overwhelming.” A Crazy Year for the World’s Largest Stock Exchange – When markets don’t know where they’re heading, when data changes day by day, indexes even at the most “solid” stock exchanges rise and fall like a trampoline. In ¼ of this year’s stock exchange sessions, the S&P 500 in New York has experienced an intra-session change of more than +/- 2%. This phenomenon has occurred at least once a week so far. According to Bloomberg, April appears to be the third most volatile month on record, following October 2008 and March 2020 in the U.S. stock market. In this backdrop of constant volatility, gold appears as a safe harbor. That’s why it continues to make history. Gold prices have outperformed the S&P 500 by 32.6 percentage points since the beginning of the year. This is the largest deviation since 1975, even greater than during the pandemic crisis in 2020. Gold prices have risen by +26.5%, while the S&P 500 index has fallen by -6.1% so far this year. Since the lows of October 2022, gold prices have returned +102%, almost double the gain of +54% from the S&P 500. Explore related questions

Title: Customer First, Agentic AI Next. Amazon Lays Out Its 2025 Road Map
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/amazon/2025/customer-first-agentic-ai-next-amazon-lays-out-its-2025-road-map/

Full Content:
Most earnings announcements and ensuing analyst calls are spent discussing all the money — or lack of it — the host company made during the previous quarter. Not so at Amazon on Thursday (May 1). It spent most of its first-quarter earnings call talking less about the dollars it made and more about how it intends to keep winning the battle for the consumer’s trust. It sounded its traditional theme of the customer experience early and often. So far, anyway, that customer is proving to be fairly resilient. By the numbers, revenue rose 10% from a year earlier to $155.7 billion, with worldwide paid units up 8%, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told analysts. Still, executives struck a cautious note about spending patterns. Deal events such as the Big Spring Sale and Ramadan promotions “helped customers save over $500 million,” CEO Andy Jassy said, adding that price sensitivity is elevated “with this being an uncertain moment for consumers.” Everyday Essentials — groceries, household staples and the like — grew more than twice as fast as the rest of the mix and now make up 1 of every 3 U.S. units sold, a sign that shoppers remain value-focused even as they keep clicking “buy.” For the current quarter, Amazon forecasts net sales of $159 billion to $164 billion and operating income of $13 billion to $17.5 billion, a bounce of between 7% and 11%. The wide range, Olsavsky noted, “reflects the complex external environment,” including tariffs and a seasonal jump in stock-based compensation. Pressed repeatedly on the potential for higher tariffs, Jassy said demand had not yet softened. If anything, he said, Amazon has seen “heightened buying in certain categories that may indicate stocking up in advance of any potential tariff impact.” The company pulled forward inventory in the first quarter, while many marketplace merchants accelerated shipments to U.S. warehouses, a tactic aimed at insulating customers from price spikes. Amazon’s risk, he argued, is muted relative to rivals. Many traditional retailers buy from middlemen who themselves import from China, “so the total tariff will be higher for these retailers than for China-direct sellers” on Amazon’s platform, Jassy said. With more than 2 million global sellers and “hundreds of millions of unique SKUs,” Jassy expects that breadth to cushion any sudden shifts in sourcing or consumer tastes. “When there are uncertain environments, customers tend to choose the provider they trust most,” he said. Behind the scenes, Amazon is pushing through the next wave of efficiency projects that helped power its recent margin rebound. Rearchitecting the inbound freight network to align with the regional fulfillment model “drove productivity in our fulfillment and transportation network,” Olsavsky said, allowing record one-day and same-day delivery volumes while holding down per-package costs. Excluding one-time charges tied to returned merchandise and early tariff buys, first-quarter operating margins would have been 7.2% in North America and 3.7% internationally. Looking ahead, Amazon will “build out same-day delivery sites, expand our rural delivery network, and add robotics and automation,” Olsavsky said, noting that the investments designed to protect profitability even if consumer demand slows. Much of the call’s second half shifted from logistics to artificial intelligence. Jassy called the technology a once-in-a-generation platform shift and said Amazon Web Services already commands a “multibillion-dollar annual revenue run rate” in generative AI services, growing triple-digit percentages despite capacity constraints. To satisfy developers, AWS has layered its Bedrock service with models from Anthropic, Meta, Mistral and Amazon’s in-house Titan family, positioning the cloud division as what Jassy called the “infrastructure for agentic AI.” The most visible proof point is Alexa. A new version, free to Prime members or $19.99 a month for others, is rolling out to more than half a billion installed devices. Unlike earlier voice assistants that merely answered questions, the upgraded Alexa can orchestrate complex routines, Jassy said. “You can say, ‘Open the shades, raise the temperature five degrees and pick dinner music,’ and she just does it. … It really is like having a great personal assistant, which most people in the world don’t have.” Early user feedback, he added, has been “very positive.” Amazon’s playbook for 2025 looks familiar: lean harder into price, speed and selection while pouring capital into technologies — particularly AI — that can widen those same moats. Whether tariffs tighten or the consumer softens, executives argue that the company’s diversified supplier base, sprawling fulfillment network and fast-growing advertising and cloud franchises give it unusual flexibility. As Jassy summed up, “We have emerged from past periods of uncertainty with more relative market segment share than we started — and I’m optimistic this could happen again.” Customer First, Agentic AI Next.

The gross GST Collections for April 2025 have scaled a new high of Rs. 2.37 lakh crores, against the previous high of INR 2.10 lakh crores in April 2024. The growth in GST collections for April is expected since GST on transactions during March, which is the last month of the fiscal year, is payable in April. Due to significant number of year end transactions which take place in March, traditionally, GST collections for April are significantly higher. However, specifically for April 2025, another indicator, which led to anticipation of significantly high GST collections was the 20.2% growth in generation of e-way bills in March 2025, as per data in the monthly economic review for March 2025 released by the Department of Economic Affairs. This is since increase in e-way bills generation is typically correlated with higher economic activity and consequently, higher GST collections.

The United States has reached out to China for talks regarding President Donald Trump’s 145% tariffs, and Beijing is amenable to them. · Meanwhile, U.S. manufacturing shrank for a second consecutive month in April as supply chains were constrained by tariffs on imported goods, which kept prices high at the factory gate and prompted some companies to fire employees. · The US NFP data which is expected to be announced today is expected to show a 130,000 job gain in April, down from a stellar 228,000 job creations reported in March. A reading below 100,000 could raise concerns about the impact of tariffs on the US labor market and bring a rebound in gold price. Technical Triggers · Gold prices have retraced 50% of their rally from $2970 (~Rs 86650) to $3509 (~Rs 99350).

BEL's shares rise as investors react positively to India's defence sector growth forecasts, highlighting significant opportunities for BEL. 1) Fivestar’s PAT beat IIFLe/consensus by1%/4% as NIM compression (-52bps qoq) and higher opex was offset by stronger non-II (+26% qoq) and lower CC vs expectation. But, AUM/disbursement growth as well as underlying AQ was weaker primarily due to the impact from the KA MFI bill. 2) Net slippages increasing by 31bps qoq to 1.7% (ann.), unique CE declined 50bps qoq and 30+ DPD increased by 50bps qoq to 9.65%. Credit costs increased by 4bps qoq to 88bps even as PCR on stage 1+2 reduced by 14bps qoq. 3) Additionally, we are also watchful of recently proposed TN bill (29% of AUM) that restricts coercive recovery practices like in KA that can impact AQ as well as growth. 4) Retain BUY from medium term perspective with TP of Rs880 (18% upside, unchanged) given Five Star’s attractive business model that can deliver ~6-7% ROAs and ~18-20% steady state (delayed due to slower growth) with less volatile spread/credit costs vs its AHFC/MFI peers and higher growth runway vs Gold NBFCs. Regards Viral Shah, IIFL The Bank of Japan (BOJ) kept interest rates steady on Thursday and sharply lowered its growth forecasts, signaling prolonged caution due to the uncertain global trade environment. With concerns over U.S. tariffs and weak exports weighing on sentiment, the BOJ suggested that conditions for future rate hikes may take time to materialize. As a result, the yen weakened to a four-week low, with the dollar climbing 1.7% to 145.45 yen, buoyed by renewed optimism surrounding potential trade agreements between the U.S. and its partners. Meanwhile, in the U.S., manufacturing remained under pressure, contracting for the second consecutive month in April. The ISM Manufacturing PMI fell to 48.7—its lowest in five months—from 49.0 in March. Tariff-related disruptions to supply chains pushed up input costs, forcing some firms to cut jobs, even as overall layoffs announced by employers declined. On the diplomatic front, a Chinese state media outlet reported that the U.S. had reached out to Beijing through multiple channels to resume talks and defuse the ongoing tariff dispute. The outreach hints at a potential thaw in the standoff that has rattled global markets. In China’s property sector, the average resale home price across 100 cities dropped by 0.7% MoM in April, as more inventory entered the market, intensifying competition. YoY, resale home prices plunged 7.2%. In contrast, new home prices rose by 2.5% over the same period, underlining a divergence in market trends. South Korea offered a mixed picture, with exports showing surprising resilience despite external headwinds. Driven by robust semiconductor demand, exports rose 3.7% year-on-year in April to $58.21 billion—the fastest pace in four months. However, signs of strain emerged in the automotive sector, which has started to feel the heat of rising global trade tensions. On the domestic front, Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections hit an all-time high of Rs 2.37 lakh crore, rising 12.6% year-on-year Domestic GST collections grew 10.7% to Rs 1.9 lakh crore, while revenue from imports surged 20.8% to Rs 46,913 crore. Net GST revenue stood at over Rs 2.09 lakh crore, up 9.1% year-on-year, reflecting strong economic momentum and fiscal year-end reconciliations. India’s external sector also reached a milestone, with total exports of goods and services touching a historic high of $825 billion in FY25. This was largely fueled by a record $386.5 billion in services exports. In March alone, services exports jumped 18.6% to \$35.6 billion, defying global trade headwinds. On the inflation front, retail price pressures eased for rural India. Inflation for farm workers dropped to 3.73% in March 2025, down from 4.05% in February. Similarly, inflation for rural workers eased to 3.86%, compared to 4.10% a month earlier, as per official data—offering relief to households in the hinterlands.

Title: Apple’s $95 Billion Sales Quarter Tops Wall Street Estimates as Tech Giant Stays Quiet on Tariffs
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/apple-second-quarter-earnings-2025/
Time Published: 2025-05-01T20:45:49Z

Pro Available to WrapPRO members The world’s most valuable company reports record revenue of nearly $27 billion for its sector that includes Apple TV+ and Apple Music Apple surpassed what Wall Street analysts were looking for on Thursday when it shared its January to March earnings, with the world’s most valuable company reporting more than $95 billion in sales during the quarter. And notably, CEO Tim Cook shared an update on how President Trump’s tariff plan would affect the tech giant during the current quarter, saying it would add $900 million to costs. The strong start to 2025 was bolstered by a record $26.65 billion in revenue for Services, Apple’s wide-ranging sector that includes Apple TV+, Apple Music, and iCloud storage. That big Services quarter helped offset a slight decline in sales from China. Conspicuously, the tech giant did not mention anything about tariffs, China, or President Trump in its press release accompanying its report. Apple has been in the spotlight lately, as investors and analysts have looked to see how the president’s new tariffs will affect the company, which makes most of its products in China. But Cook did address the tariffs on Apple’s earnings call on Thursday afternoon, saying they had a “limited impact” on the company between Jan. and March. That has changed since the president announced his “Liberation Day” tariff plan on Apr. 2, with Cook saying that if nothing changes on the tariff front, “we estimate the impact to add $900 million to our costs.” Cook added it was difficult to “precisely estimate the impact of tariffs, as we are uncertain of potential future actions.” He also said most iPhones sold in the U.S. during the current quarter will come from India, while the “vast majority” of products sold outside the States will still come from China. Apple’s stock price was down 3% to $206.88 per share in after-hours trading. Here are the key results from Apple’s second quarter report: Revenues: $95.36 billion, up 5.10% year-over-year and more than the $94.26 billion that was projected by analysts, according to Zacks Investment Research. Net income: $24.78 billion, up nearly 5% from last year’s $23.63 billion. Earnings Per Share: Apple’s diluted earnings per share of $1.65 were better than analyst estimates of $1.61 EPS. iPhone Sales: Revenue from Apple’s linchpin device increased nearly 2% annually to $46.84 billion. The uptick stands out, considering Apple reported iPhone sales dipped during the final three months of 2024, even as the company reported its best quarterly revenue ever. Services: As noted above, Apple reported $26.65 billion in sales for its Services sector — up 11.64% from the same time last year. This was the second straight quarter Apple set a company sales record for Services, after Apple posted $26.34 billion in Services revenue during the final months of 2024. And as is usually the case, Apple did not mention how much its streaming service, Apple TV+, contributed to revenue; the company also does not share how much Apple Music brought in. Wearables: This was the only sector of Apple’s business that reported a decline in sales. Wearables, which includes Apple Watch and AirPods, reported a 4.94% decline in sales to $7.52 billion. Heading into Thursday, it has been a relatively challenging year for Apple. The company’s stock price is down 12% since the start of the year — a performance mirrored by the other Big Tech companies so far in 2025. Notably, Cook joined Elon Musk, Amazon Founder Jeff Bezos, Alphabet boss Sundar Pichai, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg at President Trump’s inauguration in January. The real action for Apple, though, started in April. Apple was rocked by the president’s tariff plan, with the company seeing its valuation drop by $1 trillion in a matter of days after the tariffs were announced. President Trump’s new tariffs — which now include a 145% tariff on most Chinese imports — has worried Apple analysts and investors since most of the company’s devices are made in China. Apple scrambled to get products into the U.S. before the tariffs went into effect, including flying in 1.5 million iPhones from India. Apple’s stock price has rebounded in recent weeks, recovering most of the $1 trillion that was shaved from its market cap; the company had a $3.20 trillion valuation when markets closed on Thursday. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company announced on Thursday it was increasing its cash dividend 4% to $0.26 per share, and mentioned its board of directors had authorized a $100 billion stock repurchase plan. Cook, in his statement accompanying earnings, took a moment to note the company had reduced its carbon footprint. “Today Apple is reporting strong quarterly results, including double-digit growth in Services,” Cook said. “We were happy to welcome iPhone 16e to our lineup, and to introduce powerful new Macs and iPads that take advantage of the extraordinary capabilities of Apple silicon. And we were proud to announce that we’ve cut our carbon emissions by 60 percent over the past decade.” Apple’s report did not mention anything about its artificial intelligence efforts, although Cook briefly touched on AI in his prepared remarks during the company’s earnings call on Thursday afternoon. Cook said Apple’s AI features, like its writing tools and notification summaries, “help users stay focused and get more done.” He also noted Apple Intelligence, as the company calls it, recently started translating more languages. And one aspect of Apple’s report that stood out: China was the only market where sales declined year-over-year; revenue from China dropped 2.25% to $16.00 billion for the quarter.

Title: Amazon Tops Q1 Earnings Estimates—But Stock Slides On Soft Guidance
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2025/05/01/amazon-tops-q1-earnings-estimates-but-stock-slides-on-soft-guidance/

Amazon delivered results from 2025’s first three months Thursday afternoon—adding to a blockbuster week that included a short-lived standoff between the company and White House—as investors pay keen attention to how the e-commerce giant will comment on how President Trump’s tariffs will impact its business. The White House took significant issue with Amazon’s rumored plans to highlight tariff-related price ... More increases this week. Amazon brought in $155.7 billion in revenue and $1.59 earnings per share ($17.1 billion net income), beating consensus analyst estimates of $155.1 billion in revenue and $1.37 earnings per share ($14.6 billion net income), according to FactSet data. But the Seattle-based firm said it expects the second quarter won’t live up to what Wall Street expected. Amazon guided for $159 billion to $164 billion in Q2 sales ($161.5 billion midpoint) and between $13 billion and $17.5 billion in Q2 operating income ($15.3 billion midpoint), comparing unfavorably to estimates of $161.2 billion in sales and $17.6 billion operating profit for Amazon’s current quarter. Shares of Amazon declined more than 2% in after-hours trading on the weaker-than-expected outlook for the current quarter. Amazon’s artificial intelligence heavy AWS cloud segment booked annual sales growth of 17% to $29.3 billion, roughly in line with forecasts of $29.4 billion. Amazon said "tariff and trade policy" changes were among the complicating factors in issuing guidance, a reference that was not in the previous quarter's outlook. About half of Amazon’s third-party sellers are from China, according to Marketplace Pulse. Many major U.S. companies are warning investors in their earnings reports about the impact tariffs will have. Shares of Amazon climbed 3% on Thursday to $190, closing at their highest level in three weeks. The rally came as the Nasdaq spiked 1.5% following strong earnings reports from Facebook parent Meta and Microsoft. Amazon will hold its earnings call with investors at 5 p.m., livestreamed here. The “biggest focus” for the call will be how Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and management address tariffs, according to Bank of America analyst Justin Post. Amazon and Apple are among the U.S. companies with the heaviest exposure to China tariffs. Both of their stocks have underperformed many of their peers accordingly, as Amazon’s -14% year-to-date return and Apple’s -15% return is worse than the S&P 500’s -5%. Amazon briefly became the target of the Trump administration’s ire Tuesday when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt deemed the retailer’s reported plans to directly display tariff price increases to consumers a “hostile and political act.” Amazon spokesperson Tim Doyle told Forbes the company only mulled adding those tariff items to its low-price Haul site, but it was “never approved and not going to happen.” Trump called Amazon chairman Jeff Bezos to voice his displeasure with highlighting any tariff price increases. Bezos is a “good guy” and “solved the problem very quickly,” Trump told reporters Tuesday. Bezos is the second-wealthiest person in the world thanks mostly to his 9% stake in Amazon, according to Forbes’ estimates. His $208 billion net worth trails only the $387 billion fortune of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Correction (5/1): Amazon’s Q1 revenue and AWS year-over-year growth were updated. One Community. Many Voices.

The original cryptocurrency was recently changing hands around $96,600, a 2.7% increase over the past 24 hours, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Altcoins showed bigger gains, with Ethereum and Dogecoin rising 3.5% to $1,850 and 5% to $0.18, respectively. Microsoft and Meta posted quarterly profits on Wednesday surpassing analyst expectations and indicating U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war isn’t weighing on “Magnificent Seven” stocks or the artificial intelligence trade that temporarily turned chipmaker Nvidia into the world’s most valuable firm last year. Nvidia itself saw its stock price jump 2.6% to $112, according to Yahoo Finance. Ahead of Trump’s visit to the U.A.E. scheduled later this month, the U.S. is considering a bilateral chip deal that would ease restrictions on Nvidia sales to the region, per Bloomberg. According to Steven Lubka, head of private clients at Swan Bitcoin, Bitcoin is benefiting from a risk-on sentiment, despite recently rallying on tariff-fueled turmoil alongside gold. The precious metal was set to fall 2.5% on Thursday, according to Yahoo Finance. “The narrative that’s been going around Wall Street for the last few weeks is, ‘heads we win, tails we win,’” he said. “Either the [economic] situation keeps getting worse and Bitcoin rallies with gold [...], or we get out of this whole tariff situation [and] Bitcoin wins in that scenario too.” The U.S. economy contracted at an annualized rate of 0.3% in the first quarter, underscoring recession concerns, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis said on Wednesday. Some analysts think that Bitcoin would benefit if a slowdown forces the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates. For small businesses across America, an economy ailing from Trump’s tariffs would likely cause “irreparable” harm, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce warned in a letter on Thursday. “They need immediate relief from tariffs,” the business organization’s President and CEO, Suzanne P. Clar, wrote. “As each day goes by, small businesses are increasingly endangered by higher costs and interrupted supply chains.” Lubka said that markets were sensitive to Trump’s tariffs at first, but as the economic impact of them becomes increasingly clear, investors are starting to see through them. “The market is realizing that this is just not where we’re going to end up,” he said. “They think they’re not going to stick.” Edited by James Rubin Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Steady gains in London as European markets closed

London markets held steady on Thursday, continuing its recovery from April’s turbulence continuing as stocks were climbing in the US. Many markets in Europe, including Euronext Dublin, were closed for the May Day holiday, so the pan-European Stoxx 600 index was flat. LONDON The export-heavy index was little changed by the close after advancing for 13 straight sessions. It clawed back losses from earlier in the day to gain 0.02 per cent, to close at 8,496.8. “We expect tariff talk to ramp up again even if a deal emerges from this 90-day pause,” said Panmure Liberum strategist Susana Cruz. “So the recovery and European growth might remain capped.” She added that the FTSE 100 should continue to outperform, given its focus on income and quality stocks. A mixture of shares in the index were making gains, including housebuilders and financial services firms, while Marks & Spencer was dragging on the index. The UK retailer is continuing to recover from a cyber security attack last week, which has forced it to pause online orders and stop hiring, as it works to resolve problems in its systems. The UK’s blue chip index has been on a winning streak with two straight weeks of gains – its longest run in eight years. It was teetering on the edge of ending this streak with a downturn during the day, but was given a late lift as stock markets opened higher in the US. Rolls-Royce told shareholders it has had a “strong start” to the year and expects to mitigate the impact of US tariffs, and shares rose 1.7 per cent. The engineering giant said it was on track to deliver between £2.7 billion and £2.9 billion of underlying operating profit for 2025. It also said it was closely monitoring the impact of inflation and a wider economic slowdown on demand for its products. Lloyds Banking Group reported a fall in profits for the first quarter of the year, compared with 2024, as it set aside more money for bad debts The banking group disclosed £309 million of impairment charges, up from £57 million a year ago, including £100 million for potential borrower defaults. Shares in the lender were 2.7 per cent lower at close. London-listed Haleon, which has a large plant in Waterford, was up 3.27 per cent in trading to 388.7 pence after adjusted its forecast profits higher than expected due to increased demand. The biggest risers on the index were St James’s Place, Whitbread, Polar Capital Technology Trust, Informa, and EasyJet. The losers of note were Lloyds, AB Foods, London Stock Exchange, Marks & Spencer, and Pearson. The pound was weakening against the US dollar, down 0.5 per cent against the currency at 1.3267. Sterling was up about 0.05 per cent against the euro, at 1.1772. The price of Brent crude oil was up about 0.4 per cent to 61 US dollars per barrel. NEW YORK Wall Street’s main indexes jumped to around one-month highs in early afternoon trading Thursday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq leading gains. Strong quarterly results from heavyweights Microsoft and Meta pointed to a resilient outlook for the technology sector. Microsoft surged to its highest level since late January, driven by an upbeat quarterly growth forecast for its cloud-computing business Azure. The jump helped the stock surpass Apple to became the world’s most valuable company. Meta Platforms made strong gains after posting higher-than-expected revenue on the back of a strong advertising performance. Results from megacaps Amazon and Apple, due after markets close, lead to buoyancy in the companies’ stocks. Other technology megacaps also rose, with Nvidia shares gained which lifted the information technology and communication services sectors to over one-month highs. Among other earnings, Eli Lilly fell following its quarterly results, pressuring the healthcare sector, while McDonald’s dipped slightly after posting a surprise drop in first-quarter global sales. Mobile chip designer Qualcomm fell after it forecast a hit to revenue from the trade war. General Motors gained after offering a new forecast for 2025 core profit. The day’s economic data releases were mixed. The dollar index, which measures it against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, rose 0.55 per cent to 100.22, with the euro down 0.41 per cent at $1.128. – Additional reporting, Reuters, PA, Bloomberg.

Title: All Investor Eyes On Amazon: Earnings Out Today And Tariffs Are ‘Biggest Focus’
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2025/05/01/all-investor-eyes-on-amazon-earnings-out-today-and-tariffs-are-biggest-focus/
Time Published: 2025-05-01T16:13:03Z
Full Content:
Amazon delivered results from 2025’s first three months Thursday afternoon—adding to a blockbuster week that included a short-lived standoff between the company and White House—as investors pay keen attention to how the e-commerce giant will comment on how President Trump’s tariffs will impact its business. The White House took significant issue with Amazon’s rumored plans to highlight tariff-related price ... More increases this week. Amazon brought in $155.7 billion in revenue and $1.59 earnings per share ($17.1 billion net income), beating consensus analyst estimates of $155.1 billion in revenue and $1.37 earnings per share ($14.6 billion net income), according to FactSet data. But the Seattle-based firm said it expects the second quarter won’t live up to what Wall Street expected. Amazon guided for $159 billion to $164 billion in Q2 sales ($161.5 billion midpoint) and between $13 billion and $17.5 billion in Q2 operating income ($15.3 billion midpoint), comparing unfavorably to estimates of $161.2 billion in sales and $17.6 billion operating profit for Amazon’s current quarter. Shares of Amazon declined more than 2% in after-hours trading on the weaker-than-expected outlook for the current quarter. Amazon’s artificial intelligence heavy AWS cloud segment booked annual sales growth of 17% to $29.3 billion, roughly in line with forecasts of $29.4 billion. Amazon said "tariff and trade policy" changes were among the complicating factors in issuing guidance, a reference that was not in the previous quarter's outlook. About half of Amazon’s third-party sellers are from China, according to Marketplace Pulse. Many major U.S. companies are warning investors in their earnings reports about the impact tariffs will have. Shares of Amazon climbed 3% on Thursday to $190, closing at their highest level in three weeks. The rally came as the Nasdaq spiked 1.5% following strong earnings reports from Facebook parent Meta and Microsoft. Amazon will hold its earnings call with investors at 5 p.m., livestreamed here. The “biggest focus” for the call will be how Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and management address tariffs, according to Bank of America analyst Justin Post. Amazon and Apple are among the U.S. companies with the heaviest exposure to China tariffs. Both of their stocks have underperformed many of their peers accordingly, as Amazon’s -14% year-to-date return and Apple’s -15% return is worse than the S&P 500’s -5%. Amazon briefly became the target of the Trump administration’s ire Tuesday when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt deemed the retailer’s reported plans to directly display tariff price increases to consumers a “hostile and political act.” Amazon spokesperson Tim Doyle told Forbes the company only mulled adding those tariff items to its low-price Haul site, but it was “never approved and not going to happen.” Trump called Amazon chairman Jeff Bezos to voice his displeasure with highlighting any tariff price increases. Bezos is a “good guy” and “solved the problem very quickly,” Trump told reporters Tuesday. Bezos is the second-wealthiest person in the world thanks mostly to his 9% stake in Amazon, according to Forbes’ estimates. His $208 billion net worth trails only the $387 billion fortune of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Correction (5/1): Amazon’s Q1 revenue and AWS year-over-year growth were updated. One Community. Many Voices.

May 01, 2025 11:33 ET | Source: Berger Montague Berger Montague PHILADELPHIA, May 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Berger Montague PC advises investors that a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) on behalf of purchasers of AppLovin securities between May 10, 2023 through March 26, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investor Deadline: Investors who purchased or acquired AppLovin securities during the Class Period may, no later than MAY 5, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. To learn your rights, CLICK HERE. Headquartered in Palo Alto, Calif., AppLovin is a developer of a software-based platform for advertisers. According to the complaint, AppLovin and senior management misled investors regarding AppLovin’s financial growth and stability, raising expectations as to the launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and the use of “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games. The truth began to emerge on February 26, 2025, when analysts Fuzzy Panda and Culper Research each published reports accusing AppLovin of, among other things, reverse-engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged that AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, thus presenting false installation numbers and profits. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025 – a decline of $46.06 per share, or 12%. Then, on March 26, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a report alleging numerous issues with the Company, including that AppLovin used proprietary third-party data in a manner that violated the terms of service of Facebook, Google, Snap, Reddit, as well as other platforms, potentially leading to backlash and service blocking and threatening the sustainability of AppLovin’s revenue growth. On this news, the Company’s stock fell $65.92 per share, or 20%, from a close of $327.62 per share on March 26, 2025 to a close of $261.70 per share on March 27, 2025.

Title: McDonald's has a warning about the economy

McDonald’s stock price declined more than 1% on Thursday on disappointing first-quarter results, as broad economic pressures weighed on customers and kept them away. The iconic chain’s U.S. same-store sales dropped 3.6% — a rare miss uncomfortably recalling a similar drop during the 2020 pandemic. Global comparable sales slipped 1%. Total revenue declined 3% to $5.96 billion, while earnings dipped 2% to $2.60 per share. “Consumers today are grappling with uncertainty,” said CEO Chris Kempczinski in the earnings release, calling out macro pressures as guest counts underwhelmed – i.e., as customers skipped their Big Macs and fries. Management was careful to note that the absence of Leap Day distorted year-over-year comparisons, because when you’re the size of McDonald’s, even one fewer sales day per year makes a difference. But the broader story was one of anxious consumers. International results were uneven. Japan and the Middle East helped McDonald’s licensed markets grow 3.5%, but U.K. consumers seemed particularly cautious, dragging down company-operated regions. It wasn’t all bad news, however. One bright spot was McDonald’s digital loyalty program, which drove $8 billion in systemwide sales this quarter and more than $31 billion over the past year — proof that customer engagement remains strong, even as wallets tighten. Those app-based deals for $1.29 any-size fries and 20% off orders over $12 are simply hard to ignore, and become all the more compelling as wallets tighten. McDonald’s joins a growing list of consumer-facing brands flashing warning signs. Harley-Davidson (HOG) yanked its full-year guidance Thursday, citing tariff fears. Starbucks (SBUX) saw shrinking margins and slowing traffic. Sysco (SYY), the largest restaurant supplier in the U.S. and UK, also missed, suggesting a burgeoning restaurant recession cutting across both the higher and lower ends of the markets. Consumer confidence just saw its sharpest drop in years. Meanwhile on Thursday, Wall Street – a part of it, anyway — is roaring. Big Tech earnings from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) have powered the Nasdaq higher, with Microsoft up 9% and Meta gaining over 6%. As investors chase AI growth and bet on hyper-scaling, the disconnect between Wall Street and Main Street looks to be growing starker. And for companies relying on middle- and lower-income, discretionary spending, the squeeze is here — and it’s showing up in the numbers.

Title: Microsoft and Meta just revived the stock market's AI trade

The Nasdaq has recovered all of the losses sparked by President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement on April 2. The Nasdaq 100 plunged as much as 15% since the sky-high tariff announcement, but has since surged as much as 20% as the Trump administration rescinded some of the tariffs and instituted a 90-day pause. Solid earnings results from Microsoft and Meta Platforms helped boost tech stocks even higher on Thursday. During their earnings calls, both companies hyped up AI tech and committed to making massive investments in AI infrastructure. Shares of AI-related stocks boomed Thursday morning, with Nvidia up as much as 5%, and other names including Arista Networks, Vistra, CoreWeave, and Vertiv also surging. The jump in tech shares helped indexes rally after a mixed day on Wednesday, following a slate of weak economic data. Here's where major US indexes stood at about 11:10 a.m. ET: Meta raised capex guidance for 2025 to $64 billion to $72 billion from $60 billion to $65 billion, though higher costs due to tariffs could be playing a role in the increased guidance. The jump in capex plans suggests that the AI infrastructure buildout isn't slowing down as had been feared in recent months following the release of the highly efficient DeepSeek model from a startup in China. "We expect this significant infrastructure footprint we are building will not only help us meet the demands of our business in the near term, but also provide us an advantage in the quality and scale of AI services we can deliver," Meta Platforms CFO Susan Li said on the company's earnings call. Wall Street analysts cheered the results. Bank of America reiterated its "Buy" rating for the stock on Thursday and raised its price target to $690 per share, a potential jump of 16% from Thursday's intraday high. Meanwhile, Microsoft spent the bulk of its earnings call talking about the importance of AI and how it's helping grow its business across the cloud and enterprise software. "Cloud and AI are the essential inputs for every business to expand output, reduce costs, and accelerate growth," Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said. Microsoft's Azure cloud business posted year-over-year revenue growth of 33%, of which about 16% was attributed to AI. "The company is still doubling down on the AI monetization strategy within cloud," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note after Microsoft's earnings. Microsoft reiterated its guidance to spend $80 billion in capital expenditures this year. Jump to

Good morning. President Donald Trump held a rally this week in Macomb County, Michigan, to mark his first 100 days in office. BI had a reporter in attendance. The key issue for rallygoers they spoke with was, surprisingly, not the economy. Read the full story. In today's newsletter, it's a crucial week for Big Tech. We're breaking down the key details from Meta's and Microsoft's earnings reports — and looking ahead to what Wall Street will be watching for when Apple and Amazon report today. Exciting news: Tech Memo, a weekly BI newsletter from Alistair Barr, is launching soon. Get the scoop on what's happening inside the world's most powerful tech companies — sign up here! What's on deck Markets: Despite the S&P 500's recent rally, Wall Street forecasters see more pain ahead. Tech: Meta, Microsoft, and Google are leading a performance management vibe shift. Business: Why you can expect to see more professionally produced videos on your LinkedIn feed. But first, a moment of truth. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. It's a big week for Big Tech. On Wednesday, Meta and Microsoft reported earnings. Today, it's Apple's and Amazon's turn. The backdrop is grim: a global trade war, the looming threat of stagflation, and falling consumer sentiment. Despite these mounting challenges, this earnings season may hold the keys to a potential stock rally. As of writing, US futures are up following Microsoft's and Meta's reports. Let's kick things off there. The Ms Meta. Another win. Its $42.3 billion in revenue and $6.43 EPS smashed forecasts. Meta shares are up around 6% premarket. CEO Mark Zuckerberg was as bullish as ever on the company's AI plans, with Meta raising its spending estimates for the year. Meanwhile, the company's Reality Labs division lost around $4 billion, again. As BI's Pranav Dixit writes, recent layoffs could signal the beginning of the end for Reality Labs. Up next, Apple and Amazon report earnings after the bell. The As 1. Meet BI's Investor of the Month. David Miller, manager of the Strategy Shares Gold Enhanced Yield ETF, has had a good few months, as investors turn to the safe-haven asset during volatility. His fund has stood out, up 23% this year and 37% over the past 12 months. 2. Investors aren't out of the woods yet. Stocks may have recovered from a historic sell-off in April, but Wall Street pros warn the market could be headed for more pain. They shared three warning signs they see on the horizon. 3. Inside a top stock-picker's investing process. Steve Schurr was central to the equities rebuild at Balyasny, and he was recently poached by Millennium with a $100 million pay package. Here's a look at how he picks investments, according to a presentation recording viewed by BI. 1. Carrots and sticks. No more cushy perks and low accountability: Companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Google are adopting high rewards (carrots) and steep consequences (sticks) for performance management. It reflects an industry shift toward leaner and more intense workplaces. 2. Elon Musk's staying put at Tesla. That's according to the company's chair Robyn Denholm, who denied that the Tesla's board had considered replacing Musk as CEO, in a post on Tesla's X account on Wednesday. 3. Shopify sunsets its revenue share exemption. App developers aren't happy about the policy change and said it would force them to re-evaluate their budgets for 2026. It's bad timing as merchants are already looking to cut costs amid tariffs. 1. CEOs are being grilled on tariff impacts. Here's what CEOs of major companies have said about the trade war's effects on their businesses — and consumers' wallets. Trump's recent rebuke of Amazon means some retailers are likely proceeding with caution, retail experts told BI. 2. Bank of New York Mellon Corp. calls for four days in the office. The memo sent to staff, a copy of which was obtained by BI, said there were "no plans" for employees to return the full five days. It's the latest bank to rein in remote work. 3. LinkedIn wants a bigger slice of the creator economy. The professional networking site said it's planning to launch five new shows from business-oriented creators, including podcast host Steven Bartlett and fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff. Apple, Amazon, McDonald's, Reddit, and Airbnb report earnings. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York (on parental leave).

Tech stocks roared on Thursday, lifting the Nasdaq 1.2%, with the S&P 500 rising 0.6% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 83 points by market close. Amazon’s after-the-bell earnings release showed a handy beat of analyst estimates as the e-commerce giant posted earnings of $1.59 per share, smashing Street estimates of $1.37. Net sales grew 9% to $155.7 billion and AWS segment sales grew 17% to $29.3 billion. Whether Wall Street loves the results is still up in the air, however, with Amazon stock slipping 2% after hours. Perhaps Microsoft’s cloud and AI-related growth set the bar too high. Earlier on Thursday, Mastercard (MA) reported a solid first quarter, with net revenue climbing 14% year-over-year to $7.3 billion, or 17% on a currency-neutral basis, and adjusted earnings per share rising 13% to $3.73. Growth was driven by strong cross-border volume, which climbed 15%, and gross dollar volume and switched transactions, both up 9%. CEO Michael Miebach highlighted strategic partnerships with Microsoft and OpenAI, calling the company’s business model “diversified and resilient” despite macro uncertainty. In addition to Amazon results after the bell, investor were also waiting for results from Apple and Airbnb (ABNB). U.S. markets rose Thursday morning, lifted by blockbuster earnings from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) that seemed strong enough to overshadow Wednesday’s unexpected GDP contraction. With Big Tech’s collective market cap nearing $10 trillion, investor sentiment looked ready to ride the rally — if Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) can stick the landing after Thursday’s close. Unsurprisingly, the Nasdaq was leading the charge, up 1.8%. The S&P was up under 0.8%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 0.3%. Delivering their latest quarterlies after Wednesday’s bell, Microsoft and Meta both crushed expectations. Microsoft’s Azure cloud revenue surged 33% year-over-year, driving an 18% jump in earnings per share. Meta posted a staggering 89% profit increase on 27% revenue growth. Microsoft stock was up 9% before the bell Thursday. Shares of Meta added more than 6%. The underlying strength of both reports has markets betting that Amazon, as another “hyperscaler” helping bigwig enterprise customers get in on the AI revolution, will keep the momentum going. Apple, with its different mix of exposure to consumer spending, tariffs, and trade winds, was down about 1.5%. Microsoft’s quarter drew gushing praise from analysts both on and off the earnings call, with Wedbush calling it “an Aaron Judge-like performance” (referring to the New York Yankees slugger). Azure beat both the Street and internal targets, with AI workloads accounting for nearly half the cloud platform’s growth. The company reaffirmed its $80 billion FY25 capital expenditures forecast and said infrastructure investments will continue to rise in FY26 — putting to rest speculation about data center cutbacks. Wedbush raised its price target from $475 to $515. Meta stock jumped after hours as the company reported EPS of $6.43 on revenue of $42.3 billion, beating estimates on both the top and bottom lines. “While many companies have held back guidance amid tariff uncertainty, META did — a bullish sign,” Zacks strategist Andrew Rocco said. The company’s Q2 revenue forecast of $42.5 to $45.5 billion topped Street estimates, and planned 2025 capital expenditures of $64-$72 billion suggest Meta is betting big on sustained AI demand. Even after the Senate narrowly rejected a bipartisan push to block Trump’s new tariffs, trade tensions remain unresolved. U.S. Trade Representative Sarah Bianchi Greer said there are “no official talks yet” with China — though smaller deals with other nations may materialize in the coming weeks. The continuing ambiguity continues to haunt earnings calls and cloud forward guidance, and both Amazon and Apple will likely have to mention the elephant as they report later today. McDonald’s missed earnings expectations as global sales fell, revenue declined, and U.S. same-store sales lagged, with the company pointing to wary consumers and geopolitical headwinds. Harley-Davidson (HOG), meanwhile, pulled its full-year guidance altogether after international sales tumbled — citing the growing weight of global trade uncertainty. These warnings reinforce that tariff fears aren’t just weighing on Wall Street — they’re reshaping strategy in C-suites across America. And it’s not just large caps like McDonald’s feeling the strain. The Russell 2000, a barometer of small-cap performance, is down 13.5% so far this year — by far the hardest hit of the four major indexes. It’s a reminder that smaller companies, lacking the pricing power and global leverage of Big Tech, may be the sheer most vulnerable. A Wall Street Journal report suggesting Tesla’s (TSLA) board began looking to replace Elon Musk “about a month ago” was later denied by the board. Musk recently announced he’d been spending more time on Tesla, however. Tesla stock closed down slightly. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Forbes Daily: Trump Plays The Blame Game As U.S. GDP Slips

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. Despite reporting a negative first quarter, Etsy is crafting a message that it can stand out amid President Donald Trump’s trade war. The $4.4 billion marketplace for handmade and vintage goods fell far short of Wall Street’s expectations, losing 49 cents per share. But the company is leaning into the fact that over half of the products on its site are sourced from the U.S., and promoting tools that help buyers filter for locally made goods. Meanwhile, rivals like Temu and Shein have already raised prices due to tariffs. “Etsy’s relative value may get better particularly against sites who have a lot of their products sold made in China,” CEO Josh Silverman said on the company’s earnings call. A U.S. flag flies near containers stacked high on a cargo ship at the Port of Los Angeles. U.S. GDP contracted 0.3% in the first quarter, government estimates show, revealing the most comprehensive picture yet of the health of the country’s economy. It’s the weakest economic growth for the U.S. in three years, as the Bureau of Economic Analysis said the negative GDP reading “primarily reflected” an increase in imports, which surged as businesses aimed to get ahead of tariffs, and a decrease in government spending. MORE: President Donald Trump blamed the dip on former President Joe Biden, suggesting any decline in the second quarter could also be the former president’s fault. Trump has also blamed Biden for stock market losses, despite previously taking credit for gains during the last administration. Elon Musk and the chair of Tesla’s board strongly denied a report from the Wall Street Journal that said the carmaker’s board began a search for a new CEO to take over from Musk amid concerns about the company’s plunging stock price. The report claimed that Tesla’s board members had been in touch with recruitment firms to find a successor in an effort to appease “irritated” investors, but board chair Robyn Denholm dismissed the report as “absolutely false.” A crucial measure of inflation slowed in March to its lowest level in years, though it remains above the Fed’s 2% goal. Most economists view tariffs as inflationary, which is expected to complicate the central bank’s efforts to bring price increases down to historically palatable levels. In the midst of a pivotal week for big tech earnings, Microsoft reported its best-ever quarterly revenue and profit totals, while fellow big tech firm Meta also exceeded expectations. Amazon and Apple will report their quarterly results later today, and tariffs remain a looming question mark. “This is a key few days ahead for the markets and tech world,” remarked Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. Who is the richest person in each state? Who is the richest person in your state? Forbes’ latest ranking includes 54 entrepreneurs, investors and heirs worth a record $2 trillion combined, with billionaires in every state but three. Five states have a new wealthiest resident, for instance in Washington, where former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer beats out his old boss Bill Gates after Forbes upped its estimate of the 2021 divorce settlement secured by Gates’ ex-wife Melinda French Gates. Bots are flooding the internet, already making up 50% of all web traffic—a number that’s expected to surge with the adoption of AI. To combat the problem, San Francisco-based Persona is helping companies like OpenAI, LinkedIn and Reddit verify users’ identities, and on Wednesday, the company announced it had raised $200 million, bringing its valuation to $2 billion. As emerging defense companies get a major boost, Accel and New Enterprise Associates are co-leading a $275 million funding round into Chaos Industries, which sells a suite of communications and radar products. The funding, which Forbes reporting revealed values the company at $2 billion, follows a slew of funding rounds announced by Silicon Valley-backed defense tech companies this year. A resolution to reject President Donald Trump’s global tariffs failed in a 49-49 vote in the Senate on Wednesday, after two senators in support of the measure did not attend the vote. A spokesperson for Senator Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who was absent due to illness, reiterated the senator’s stance against the tariffs to Punchbowl News, saying McConnell “believes that tariffs are a tax increase on everybody.” Trump’s trade war with China threatens to make his immigration agenda costlier: Some of the biggest tech suppliers to border and immigration cops are warning about the possibility of increased prices nationwide. An increase in tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada “could have a significant impact on our business,” Axon Enterprise, which provides body cameras, Tasers and cloud-based evidence storage, wrote in an April SEC filing. After months of negotiations, the U.S. and Ukraine have signed an agreement creating the United States–Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund, which will reportedly allow the U.S. some access to Ukraine’s natural resources. The Treasury Department said in a statement the fund is in “recognition of the significant financial and material support that the people of the United States have provided to the defense of Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion” and will help “accelerate Ukraine’s economic recovery.” Pat Neal Florida homebuilder Pat Neal has become a billionaire by catering to the “marvelous middle”: middle- and upper-middle-class families spending between $400,000 and just over $1 million for a new home. “Our strategy is to float above the public homebuilders, to build a home of higher quality,” he says. That means marble surfaces, more landscaping, brick entryways, painted garage floors and cabinets made of solid wood. His company, Neal Communities, has a “perfection committee” that works on issues like making sure oven, microwave and refrigerator doors can open simultaneously without bumping into each other. All this attention to detail and focus on middle- and upper-middle income customers has been a winning strategy: The privately held business is now one of Southwest Florida’s biggest builders, and Forbes estimates that 76-year-old Neal, who owns 100% along with his two sons, has a net worth of $1.2 billion. But this year could test him like no other since the Great Recession. The western part of the Sunshine State, where Neal operates, has its highest housing supply in 15 years at the same time that Covid-era inward migration is dropping off. Home values there could decrease as much as 9% over the coming year, according to the real estate data platform Reventure. Macro trends don’t look favorable either, with high interest rates reducing demand for houses nationwide and the tariff war threatening to add thousands of dollars to the cost of building materials. To prepare, Neal is pivoting to a “barbell-shaped strategy,” going after folks at both the higher and lower ends. “Middle-class people in the last few years have not prospered as they previously did,” Neal says. “I’m moving to the edges for the present, hoping that the marvelous middle recovers over the course of time.” WHY IT MATTERS “Many experts think the housing market is set for one of its worst years in recent memory,” says Forbes reporter Monica Hunter-Hart. “The axe is already coming down hard in Florida, where builder Pat Neal says he’s slashing the prices of his houses by about 10% and simultaneously preparing to face rising costs due to tariffs. He’s implementing a risky plan to survive the economic turmoil; if it works, he’ll emerge stronger than ever.” MORE The Homebuilders Getting Rich Off America’s Housing Shortage A House Committee advanced an educational reform package this week that would overhaul student loans and make Pell Grants less accessible. The bill would also limit how much students can borrow from the federal government: Over $330 billion: How much the legislation would save the government, according to Rep.

To help cultivate it in your current role, start by stepping out of your comfort zone, brainstorming solutions to workplace challenges and scheduling time every week for career development.

Title: Is META Stock Undervalued After A Solid Q1?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - APRIL 26: In this photo illustration, the logo of Meta Platforms, Inc. is ... More displayed on a smartphone screen, with the company's infinity loop-style branding visible in the background, on April 26, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) Meta stock (NASDAQ: META) recently announced its Q1 performance, with revenues and earnings significantly surpassing street predictions. It registered sales of $42.3 billion and earnings of $6.43 per share, compared to the consensus forecasts of $41.3 billion and $5.22, respectively. The firm continued to enjoy advantages from a growing user base. Additionally, its outlook for Q2 was more promising than anticipated. META stock, which has seen a 5% decline since the start of the year, has exhibited performance in line with the larger NASDAQ index, which has decreased by 8%. The company’s investments in AI have begun to yield benefits in terms of increased user engagement, suggesting favorable prospects for its stock. However, if you are seeking positive returns with a smoother experience than that of a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P and recorded >91% returns since its inception. Meta Platforms’ revenues of $42.3 billion in Q1 represented a 16% year-over-year increase, driven by a 5% uptick in ad impressions and a 10% rise in average price per ad. Meta also noted a 6% increase in its family daily active people (DAP) to 3.43 billion. The company's primary revenue stream originates from advertising across its family of apps (Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp). The company is utilizing AI to enhance its ad targeting capabilities and is investing in AI-driven content generation. To support its AI strategies, Meta is undertaking considerable infrastructure investments, with anticipated capital expenditures ranging from $64-72 billion for 2025. Not only did the corporation report higher revenues, but its operating margin also expanded to 41%, rising by approximately 300 basis points year-over-year. Increased revenues and margin growth resulted in earnings of $6.43 per share, representing a 37% year-over-year increase. Looking ahead, Meta anticipates its Q2 revenue will be between $42.5 billion and $45.5 billion. At the midpoint of this range, the sales are aligned with the street expectation of $44 billion. Following the company’s impressive Q1 performance, META stock trended higher rising to $572. When examining the stock’s performance over a slightly extended timeframe, the appreciation in META stock over the past four years has been anything but steady, with annual returns being significantly more volatile than those of the S&P 500. The stock returned 23% in 2021, -64% in 2022, 194% in 2023, and 66% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, is significantly less volatile. It has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 throughout the last four-year period. What accounts for this?Collectively, the HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; they represent a less erratic investment journey, as illustrated in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the prevailing uncertain macroeconomic climate involving tariffs and trade disputes, can META stock see substantial growth? We estimate Meta Platforms’ valuation at approximately $702 per share, which indicates a 23% upside potential from its current level of around $572. Our projections are based on a 27x price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which surpasses META’s four-year average P/E of 22x. This elevated valuation multiple seems warranted considering the firm’s recent robust advertising growth and enhanced profitability. Nevertheless, there are near-term risks to consider. Ongoing tariff challenges may lead to a reduction in ad spending from China, while Meta’s heavy investment in AI introduces uncertainty regarding whether these costs will ultimately yield substantial returns and significantly enhance the company's future earnings potential. While META stock appears to have significant growth potential, it’s beneficial to examine how Meta’s Peers perform on important metrics.

Natural. Artificial. Collective," is set to transform Venice into a "Living Laboratory" of experimentation and collaboration. This year's special projects extend beyond the exhibition grounds, integrating into various city locations and Forte Marghera in Mestre, providing an alternative perspective that expands the reach of architectural discourse. The 19th International Architecture Exhibition, organised by La Biennale di Venezia under Carlo Ratti's curatorship and the theme "Intelligens. Natural. Artificial. Collective," is set to transform Venice into a "Living Laboratory" of experimentation and collaboration. This year's special projects extend beyond the exhibition grounds, integrating into various city locations and Forte Marghera in Mestre, providing an alternative perspective that expands the reach of architectural discourse. The Biennale promises to be a dynamic platform uniting over 750 participants from diverse backgrounds, including architects, engineers, mathematicians, climate scientists, and artists. Such a broad coalition of over 280 projects underlines the Exhibition's focus on inclusivity and interdisciplinary collaboration, an essential aspect for adaptation. The selection process proposed a bottom-up, open call approach through the Space for Ideas initiative, which ran between May and June 2024. It encouraged participation from global teams, from Pritzker Prize winners and Nobel laureates to emerging architects and scientists.

Special projects brought to life by La Biennale di Venezia include Margherissima at Forte Marghera. Designed by Nigel Coates and a collaborative team, it focuses on the contaminated area near Ponte della Libertà. Meanwhile, the Victoria and Albert Museum's "On Storage," curated with Brendan Cormier and Diller, Scofidio + Renfro (DS+R), delves into global storage architecture and features a new film by DS+R. Additionally, Roofscapes, one of the emerging offices selected as one of ArchDaily's 2024 Best New Practices, presents an installation on adapting Parisian buildings to heatwaves, demonstrating possible adaptations for dense urban environments..

Title: Economic Digest: Nepal’s Business News in a Snap

01 May 2025 Time taken to read : 12 Minute KATHMANDU: Economic Digest offers a concise yet comprehensive overview of significant business happenings in Nepal, presented in easily digestible summaries. Despite an increase in trading activity, Nepal’s stock market posted a third consecutive decline, with the NEPSE index dropping by 8.14 points to close at 2,623, indicating persistent investor caution. While the trading volume surged to NPR 9.37 billion, gains were limited to a few sectors such as hydropower, microfinance, and trade, while major sectors like banking, finance, and tourism experienced notable losses. This subdued market performance occurs against a backdrop of mixed economic indicators: Nepal’s projected GDP growth of 4.61% and a rise in per capita income to USD 1,517 suggest signs of recovery, especially from non-agricultural sectors. However, persistent structural issues remain—revenue collection has failed to meet targets for three consecutive years, over 29% of industries do not comply with minimum wage laws, and high-profile infrastructure projects like the Gautam Buddha International Airport suffer from weak oversight. Furthermore, policy interventions such as Nepal Rastra Bank’s plan to absorb excess liquidity and regulatory changes to procurement laws reveal ongoing efforts to stabilize the financial system. Altogether, these developments reflect an economy striving for growth amid deep-rooted fiscal and institutional inefficiencies that continue to dampen investor confidence and economic resilience. Nepal stock market drops by 8.14 points despite rise in trading volume The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) index declined for the third consecutive session on Wednesday, falling by 8.14 points to close at 2,623. The day’s highest point was 2,642. Despite the drop in the index, trading activity saw a notable uptick, with the total transaction volume reaching NPR 9.37 billion—up from NPR 7.57 billion the previous day. Among 314 traded companies, 136 saw declines in share prices, one remained unchanged, and a few posted gains. Most sector indices closed in the red. The banking sector dipped by 0.70%, development banks by 1.06%, finance by 1.24%, and hotel and tourism by 0.50%. Losses were also recorded in life insurance, investment, manufacturing, non-life insurance, and miscellaneous sectors, with declines ranging from 0.07% to 1.16%. In contrast, modest gains were seen in hydropower (0.61%), microfinance (0.04%), and trade (0.40%). Gold and silver prices drop slightly in Nepal The price of hallmark gold in Nepal dropped to NPR 188,100 per tola on Wednesday, down from NPR 188,800 the previous day. Silver prices also declined slightly to NPR 1,965 per tola, compared to NPR 1,970 the previous day, according to the Federation of Nepal Gold and Silver Dealers’ Association. Nepal’s economy projected to grow by 4.61% this fiscal year The National Statistics Office has projected Nepal’s economic growth at 4.61% for the current fiscal year, based on its preliminary national accounts estimates. This follows a revised growth rate of 3.67% for the previous fiscal year, which had initially been recorded at 3.87%. The estimate, calculated at consumer prices, points to a gradual economic rebound. The total size of the economy is expected to hit NPR 6.107 trillion by the end of FY 2081/82, up from NPR 5.704 trillion in the prior fiscal year. NRB to pull NPR 50 billion from financial system to absorb excess liquidity Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) plans to withdraw NPR 50 billion from the banking system on Wednesday as part of its ongoing effort to manage surplus liquidity. The central bank will use its deposit collection tool for a 21-day term to absorb the funds. Banks and financial institutions were invited to submit online bids by 3 PM. NRB has been conducting similar liquidity absorption operations twice weekly—on Sundays and Wednesdays—for the past 18 months due to persistent oversupply of funds in the financial sector. Per capita income in Nepal to reach USD 1,517 this year Nepal’s per capita gross national income (GNI) is projected to rise to USD 1,517 by the end of the current fiscal year, according to new figures from the National Statistics Office. This represents a USD 50 increase from last year’s per capita GNI of USD 1,467, which itself had gone up by USD 57 from the previous year. While the income trend continues upward, the rate of increase has slightly slowed. The GNI figure represents the average income per person, reflecting overall national earnings relative to the population. Revenue collection falls short of targets for three straight years Despite setting ambitious revenue targets, the government has consistently failed to meet them over the past three years. In fiscal year 2078/79, only 77.19% of the target was achieved, and just 74.43% the year before. So far this year, only 61% of the expected revenue has been collected by mid-Baisakh. However, the government continues to raise its targets, with this year’s budget set at NPR 1.86 trillion and next year’s target expected to climb even higher to NPR 1.9 trillion, as per the National Planning Commission. Subcommittee submits weak report on GBIA construction issues A parliamentary subcommittee formed to investigate irregularities in the construction of Gautam Buddha International Airport (GBIA) in Bhairahawa has submitted a report that has been criticized as weak. Led by former tourism minister and CPN-UML lawmaker Yogesh Bhattarai, the subcommittee failed to adequately address financial discipline, spending transparency, or provide a proper breakdown of the NPR 31.82 billion used in the project. Members of the committee included MPs such as Achyut Prasad Mainali, Dr. Amaresh Kumar Singh, and others. Critics, including members of the Audit Committee, expressed concern that the report ignored major issues observed during field inspections. Investment board approves structure and strategy The Investment Board of Nepal has approved its new organizational structure and business strategy during its 61st meeting, chaired by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. The board has also approved the post of a secretary and directed the office to complete a management survey based on the new structure. According to spokesperson Pradyumna Prasad Upadhyaya, the board plans to sign deals for 42 major projects worth USD 17.92 billion (NPR 2.45 trillion) by fiscal year 2085/86. No progress on social media registration despite repeated orders Despite multiple government orders, platforms like Facebook have not registered in Nepal. The government has extended the registration deadline several times, but no progress has been made. Minister for Communications and Information Technology Pradeep Subba Gurung recently gave a one-week deadline, but platforms, including Facebook’s parent company Meta, have not complied. Previously, TikTok had registered after facing a ban, but other platforms remain unregistered. Non-agricultural sector expected to fuel Nepal’s 4.61% GDP growth According to the latest projections by the Central Statistics Office, Nepal’s economy is set to expand by 4.61% this fiscal year, largely driven by gains in non-agricultural sectors. These sectors are forecast to grow by 4.28%. Meanwhile, the agricultural sector is expected to record a 3.28% increase. Rishiram Sigdel, Director of the National Accounts Division, said the projections reflect continued recovery momentum, with industry and services playing a leading role. Over 29% of industries fail to pay minimum wage A new report from GEFONT reveals that more than 29% of industries in Nepal have not implemented the minimum monthly wage of NPR 17,300. The labor audit covered 327 businesses across sectors such as manufacturing, textiles, tourism, education, and healthcare, and found widespread noncompliance with labor laws. SEBON approves IPO for Bikash Hydropower The Securities Board of Nepal (SEBON) has approved Bikash Hydropower Company’s request to issue an IPO. The company will now issue 4.45 million shares worth NPR 445.46 million at a face value of NPR 100 per share. Prabhu Capital will manage the IPO process. Procurement rules amended again to ease deadline extensions for contractors Nepal’s procurement regulations have been amended for the 14th time to allow easier extension of project deadlines. Contractors must now submit valid reasons for project delays, and applications for deadline extensions must be filed within 30 days of the amendment’s publication in the official gazette. Yarsagumba harvesting begins in Manang The collection of Yarsagumba (Cordyceps sinensis), a valuable medicinal herb, has started in Manang district. The harvesting season lasts from mid-Baisakh to the end of Asar. Locals collect the herb with permits issued by the Annapurna Conservation Area Project, following regulations and guidelines for conservation areas, national parks, and buffer zones. Nepal to import 119,000 metric tons of fertilizer for paddy farming To prevent a fertilizer shortage, Nepal is importing an additional 119,000 metric tons of fertilizer, including 94,000 metric tons of urea and 25,000 metric tons of DAP. The fertilizer is expected to arrive by the second week of Jestha, with shipments being handled by Agricultural Inputs Company Limited and Salt Trading Corporation. Gold traders can no longer charge recommendation fees Nepal Rastra Bank has barred gold traders’ associations from charging fees for issuing purchase recommendations. The new rule came after complaints about unfair charges. According to the NRB, all associations must now offer recommendations to traders for free. Hilsa border reopens but Mansarovar pilgrimage still banned Though the Hilsa border point with China reopened last year, the pilgrimage route to Kailash-Mansarovar remains closed. China shut down the route during the COVID-19 pandemic and has not reopened it since. The route had been used by around 15,000 Indian pilgrims annually before the closure. Temporary aerial tours had been launched but were later discontinued due to high costs and limited interest. Wheat output expected to fall in Kailali Wheat production in Kailali district is expected to decline slightly this year. According to the Agricultural Knowledge Center, average yield per hectare is estimated at 3.35 metric tons, down from 3.42 metric tons last year. The estimate is based on surveys in 11 local units, excluding hill areas like Chure and Mohanyal. Helicopter flights banned in Sagarmatha region during peak season Commercial helicopter flights have been banned in the Sagarmatha region during the busy mountaineering season. Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality issued a public notice warning against such operations and package sales, holding the responsible authorities accountable for any violations. Rule removed requiring manpower companies to send 100 workers abroad The mandatory rule requiring manpower companies to send at least 100 workers abroad annually has been scrapped. This provision, part of the Foreign Employment Act, was repealed through a recent bill passed by the House of Representatives. The rule had been in place since 2019 and was heavily opposed by manpower agencies.

Title: Meta Platforms crushes Wall Street’s earnings and revenue targets

UPDATED 20:51 EDT / APRIL 30 2025 by Mike Wheatley Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta Platforms Inc. delighted investors today as it crushed analysts’ targets on earnings and revenue, sending its stock higher in extended trading. The company reported first-quarter earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $6.43 per share, well ahead of the $5.28 per share consensus estimate. Revenue for the period came to $42.31 billion, up 16% from a year earlier and easily beating the Street’s target of $41.4 billion. All told, Meta delivered a net profit of $16.64 billion in the quarter, rising from $12.37 billion one year ago. On a conference call, Meta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li told analysts that the company is looking for second-quarter revenue of between $42.5 billion and $44.5 billion, the midpoint of that range matching the Street’s target of $44.03 billion. She delivered the optimistic guidance while admitting the company has been hit by reduced ad spending from e-commerce exporters based in Asia. Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg (pictured) said on the call that the business is performing well. “I think we’re positioned to navigate the macroeconomic uncertainty,” he said, referring to the trade disruption that’s anticipated to arise from U.S. President Donald Trump’s recently imposed tariffs. The company said it’s reducing its forecast for total expenses to a range of between $113 billion and $118 billion, down from $114 billion to $119 billion. However, it also raised its forecast for capital expenditures to a range of $64 billion to $72 billion, up from its previous guidance of $60 billion to $65 billion. The increased capital expenditure will be directed at “additional data center investments” that aim to support the company’s ongoing efforts in artificial intelligence, it said. It also takes into account the expected increase in hardware costs, with data center servers and storage arrays likely to be impacted by the tariffs. “There’s just a lot of uncertainty around this, given the ongoing trade discussions,” Li said. She added that the company is working to mitigate some of this uncertainty by “optimizing” its supply chain as much as possible. Li also talked about a recent ruling by the European Commission, which decided that Meta’s no-ads subscription service is not compliant with its regulations. She said the ruling could lead to a “marginally worse user experience” for users based in Europe. More importantly, it could have a “significant impact” on its European revenue, which will likely be felt as soon as the third quarter. But she reassured investors that the company is trying to resolve this issue. “We are continuing to engage actively with the European Commission further on this, so we hope to have more clarity by next quarter’s call,” she promised. Meta said it delivered $41.39 billion in advertising revenue during the past quarter, beating the Street’s forecast of $40.44 billion. Moreover, it saw its number of daily active users rise to 3.43 billion across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, rising from 3.35 billion one year earlier and surpassing the analyst target of 3.39 billion. CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino told SiliconANGLE he was impressed by the resilience of Meta’s advertising business, which benefited from ad impression growth of 5% and an average price-per-ad increase of 10% during the quarter. “Meta’s execution on operating margin was also a notable positive, expanding to 41% from 38%, but we expect greater investments in AI to compress these margins later this year,” he added. “But daily active user growth remains healthy at more than 6%.” Zuckerberg said the company’s new Threads microblogging service, which is a rival to Elon Musk’s X platform, now has more than 350 million monthly active users, up from 320 million in January. He added that the company is now looking to push more ads on Threads, but Li tempered expectations by saying it’s unlikely to drive meaningful revenue growth this year. Elsewhere, the Meta AI digital assistant has grown to almost 1 billion monthly active users, up from 700 million in January. The vast majority of those users access the service through WhatsApp, Zuckerberg said. It’s also accessible through the Messenger app and Instagram, and this week the company announced it’s getting a standalone application of its own. According to Zuckerberg, the company is trying to work out how to best integrate ads with Meta AI, and also considering charging for a premium version of the digital assistant. However, it remains focused primarily on building out the product before it starts to monetize it, he said. Meta’s Reality Labs division, which is focused on building metaverse-related technologies, continues to be a money pit. The unit posted an operating loss of $4.2 billion in the quarter, lower than the $4.6 billion forecast from analysts. Its total sales came to $412 million, down 6% from a year earlier and lower than the analyst target of $492.7 million. Last week, Meta revealed it was cutting more than 100 jobs from the Reality Labs unit. Constellation Research Inc. analyst Holger Mueller said Meta is on a roll, growing nicely and investing in its future with one in four of its revenue dollars going towards its capital expenditures. “The big prize for Meta is AI, as the combination of reality and advertising represents the ultimate connection of consumers to its business,” he said. “In the meantime, investors will be watching to see how Meta handles the inevitable headwinds coming its way.” Li also talked about the company’s ad revenues stemming from the Asia-Pacific region, which came in at $8.22 billion, below the $8.42 billion analyst forecast. She explained that the company had seen reduced spend in the U.S. from Asian e-commerce retailers, saying that this is likely thanks to the imminent end of the “de minimis” loophole, which allows for tax-free imports of goods worth less than $1,000 to the U.S. Although a portion of that spend has been redirected to other markets, those advertisers have reduced their spending “below the levels prior to April,” Li said. Meta isn’t the only ad giant bracing itself for possible headwinds relating to the tariffs and other economic uncertainties. On Tuesday, Snap Inc. withheld its outlook as a result of the uncertain conditions, while Google parent Alphabet Inc. warned last week that it expects its advertising business to take a hit. Another major advertiser, Amazon.com Inc., will report its earnings on Thursday. Despite the ad uncertainty, investors were pleased enough with Meta’s results, and its stock gained more than 5% in extended trading. However, Meta’s shares are still down just over 6% in the year to date.
