Title: The Nasdaq 100 Big Caps’ Big Price Drops: Apple, Meta, Nvidia Tesla

ByJohn Navin ByJohn Navin, Contributor. Nasdaq 100 These Nasdaq 100 Big Caps peaked months ago and have dropped in price steadily since then. Each stock has a separate, individual story but the Trump tariffs and their effects on prices play a big part on all of them. Fed Chair Jerome Powell this week said that the resulting inflation may affect interest rate policy. It’s not a good mix, according to investors who have shown their dislike by selling the shares of these well-known names. What had been hot stocks are now in the cold as ice territory as the price charts show serious downtrends for each. Wall Street is having second thoughts. Apple Apple daily price chart, 4 19 25 The early April slide below the August 2024 low near 195 is quite dramatic. The gap down from about $220 to just above$205 demonstrates the emotional quality to the selling. That buyers did not show up again until stock reached just below $170 does not instill confidence despite the short bounce that followed. That bounce failed to fill the gap down and the price remains below the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages. The tiny red circle shows the spot in early April where the former crossed below the latter, indicating the extent of trend weakness. The iPhone maker has been wounded by the Trump tariffs. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms daily price chart, 4 19 25. Meta Platforms Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Controlling Shareholder Mark Zuckerberg cannot be too happy with the recent stock performance of the company. From the February peak of $740 to the current $501 is a two-month drop of 32%. The 50-day moving average is down trending as of late March/early April. The red-dotted line connects the February top with the April high and shows the serious downward slant of the price. Are we about to witness a re-test of the August 2024 low just below the $460 level? Nvidia Nvidia daily price chart, 4 19 25. The semiconductor giant peaked in January at $152.50 and now goes for $101.49. For those who bought then and continue to hold, that’s a 33% loss. Note that since from that top to early April, the price has shown a series of lower highs and lower lows, the definition of a down trend. The 50-day moving average in mid-March crossed below the 200-day moving average, a further indication of the downward direction of trend. Although the price bounced upward for a few days, it failed to cross above the moving averages. It’s a negative as well that the April low dropped below the August 2024 low. Tesla Tesla daily price chart, 4 19 25. The November/December 2024 upward movement bears a certain resemblance to the Seig Heil hand gesture made in public in January by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Since the mid-December peak of $480 the stock has dropped to its present $241. That’s a 41% loss for those who purchased then and held on. The red circle shows where the 50-day moving average recently crossed below the 200-day moving average, an indication of trend weakness. Tesla has managed to stay above the August 2024 low, better than some of the other Nasdaq 100 big caps. A close below that level would not be pleasing to remaining investors.

Title: The Rise And Rise Of Reinforcement Learning: AI’s Quiet Revolution

More hot/cold feedback about how close to the mark one is and players may after time be able to generalise this to learn about likely hiding spots for eggs like in trees, under pot-plants in bushes for example. A quiet revolution is reshaping artificial intelligence, and it’s not the flashy one grabbing headlines. While chatbots and image generators dazzle, reinforcement learning, a method refined in academia over the past two decades, is powering the next generation of AI breakthroughs. Imagine a child learning to ride a bike: no manual, just trial, error, and the joy of balance. That’s reinforcement learning, which is an algorithm that explores, adjusts, and learns from feedback, akin to an Easter egg hunt guided by “warmer” or “colder” hints. This approach isn’t just changing how machines learn; it’s redefining what intelligence means. Illustrating the Three Types of Machine Learning: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement ... More Learning To grasp Reinforcement Learning’s s ascent, let’s first look at the two pillars of traditional machine learning: Both methods shine in their domains, and are used in combination yet they falter where data is scarce or goals are vague. That’s where Reinforcement Learning can help. Global interest in Reinforcement Learning has exploded since nature published two Google papers that ... More used to show how it could be used to train an AI to play Atari games (2015) and then that defeated the worlds Go champion (2016) Reinforcement learning learns by doing, guided only by rewards or penalties from its environment. It’s less about following a script and more about figuring things out. In 2015, Nature published a paper where Google researchers demonstrated how a reinforcement learning trained “agent” mastered Atari games using just screen pixels and the scoreboard. Through countless trials, it learned to win at Space Invaders, Q*bert, Crazy Climber and dozens of other games often with moves that stunned human players. A year later, research also published in Nature, Google used similar techniques to topple the world’s Go champion, which was a milestone once thought to be decades away. Reinforcement Learning thrives where explicit instructions don’t exist. It doesn’t need a mountain of labeled data but instead just a goal and a way to measure success. Reinforcement Learning edge lies in its efficiency and ingenuity: While OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, remains a private company, NVIDIA has become the public face of the generative AI boom. This chipmaker’s value surged from $200 billion to over $2 trillion in just two years. Many believed its advanced hardware, like that produced by NVIDIA, was essential for the massive data centers powering AI solutions from giants like OpenAI, Meta, Google, and Microsoft. NVIDIA’s relationship with ChatGPT has been compared to the iconic "Wintel" partnership between Intel and Microsoft during the rise of Windows. NVIDIAGPT Synergy: NVIDIA Share Price (Blue) Surges Alongside ChatGPT Global Search Interest (Green) ... More After Its 2022 Launch However in January 2025, DeepSeek, unveiled a new Large Language Model trained using Reinforcement Learning . This model rivals ChatGPT’s performance while requiring significantly less computational power. The announcement impacted NVIDIA heavily, causing its stock to drop more than 10% and temporarily erasing over $500 billion in value. Investors began to see that advanced AI might not always depend on such resource-intensive hardware. DeepSeek’s research quickly gained traction. Their paper, “DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning,” has been cited over 500 times, making it the most referenced reinforcement learning study of 2025. The work highlights how reinforcement learning can achieve high performance without relying on excessive computing resources.

Andrew Ng, an AI luminary and educator, touched on this in a chat with Toby Walsh at UNSW Sydney. Reflecting on his 2002 PhD thesis, Ng said, “My PhD thesis was on reinforcement learning… and my team worked on a robot.” His early bets are paying off today. Reinforcement Learning’s potential is vast: think more efficient energy grids, tailored education, or smarter robotics. But its autonomy demands caution and careful thought about the incentives used to train the models. An agent tasked with easing traffic might reroute cars through quiet streets, trade efficiency for disruption. Transparency and ethics will be key. Done right, though, Reinforcement Learning could usher in an era where machines don’t just mimic us but they illuminate new paths forward. Reinforcement Learning isn’t a footnote in AI’s story, it's a pivot. The hunt for smarter, leaner intelligence is on, and reinforcement learning is leading the charge.

Title: ‘Bitcoin Is Calling’ – Saylor Stirs The Market With Cryptic Clue

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Strategy chairman Michael Saylor, a vocal promoter of Bitcoin, stoked renewed chatter among crypto circles with his recent enigmatic tweet. Thursday’s message stating merely “Bitcoin is Calling” left many asking if a forthcoming significant purchase looms. The company recently acquired 3,450 Bitcoin at a price of $285 million. This was done after a short one-week break from their consistent acquisition pattern. Strategy has been steadfast in its aggressive acquisition strategy despite the fact that nearly all of its crypto acquisitions since November 18 have been made at higher-than-current market prices, according to reports. Saylor’s post might be a tease regarding another future purchase, given his history of sending such sarcastic remarks ahead of new acquisitions. The post also appeared to urge his 4.2 million followers to purchase BTC, which he has frequently called “the future of money.” Bitcoin is Calling. pic.twitter.com/0jo19Qbr5q — Michael Saylor (@saylor) April 17, 2025 Strategy’s shares have trounced the performance of America’s largest technology stocks, Saylor’s Wednesday filing showed. The crypto-focused firm has posted an astonishing 130% gain over the last year. These returns more than dwarf the returns of Tesla (57%), NVIDIA (30%), Apple (17%), Meta (4%), and Alphabet (2%). There is a @Strategy to beat the Magnificent 7. pic.twitter.com/TlD57hW0w0 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) April 15, 2025 Some top tech firms actually lost value during the same period. Amazon and Microsoft saw drops of 2% and 7% respectively. These comparisons highlight the significant rewards Strategy has reaped from its heavy crypto investment strategy. The chairman of Strategy has issued some provocative comments on BTC in recent weeks. Only two weeks ago, he asserted that the price volatility of the top crypto asset actually proves its utility instead of constituting a disadvantage. When someone brought up Bitcoin’s link with risky assets, Saylor contended this is so because Bitcoin is “the most liquid, salable, and accessible asset on the planet.” A day earlier than that remark, he underscored Bitcoin’s singular status among commodities by noting that there are no tariffs on it. His remark highlighted its digital nature and liquidity as central to what makes it functionally decentralized. Saylor has established himself as one of Bitcoin’s most vocal proponents. His tweets tend to center on the fact that there are only 21 million coins in existence, which he recently referred to as “the most important number in finance.” He has also likened Bitcoin to chess, although the meaning behind this comparison wasn’t elaborated in coverage. The chairman’s most recent statement comes as Strategy maintains its focus of continuing to buy Bitcoin for the long term, no matter what happens in the short term. With the company’s shares outperforming technology giants and Saylor’s ongoing public support, most crypto observers are now looking to see if another significant purchase of crypto comes after his cryptic “calling” tweet.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: AppLovin (APP) Under Pressure: Analyst Downgrades Follow Short Seller Barrage, Investor Lawsuit – Hagens Berman

April 18, 2025 14:36 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads. Following the release of these reports, the price of AppLovin shares reportedly fell by more than 12%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the claims. “The allegations detailed in the short reports and outlined in the recently filed class action complaint, detailing the purported exploitation of user data and manipulative installation schemes, raise serious questions about the integrity of AppLovin's reported growth and the accuracy of its disclosures to the investing public,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: Meta's antitrust trial heats up: Here's what we learned in week one
URL: https://qz.com/meta-ftc-antitrust-trial-week-1-zuckerberg-1851776650
Time Published: 2025-04-18T18:06:00Z
Full Content:
In week one of the Federal Trade Commission’s blockbuster monopoly trial against Meta (META-1.69%), CEO Mark Zuckerberg spent around 10 hours on the stand as the agency questioned him about revealing emails from another era. This trial is only just getting started. Throughout it, the FTC will argue that Facebook engaged in a “buy or bury” ploy to eliminate its rivals and gain monopoly power in the social media market. Meanwhile, Meta will make the case that it is responsible for its acquisitions’ runaway successes — and that even after buying Instagram (in 2012) and WhatsApp (in 2014), Meta still faces formidable competition from the likes of TikTok and YouTube (GOOGL+1.23%). At stake is Zuckerberg’s $1.27 trillion social media empire; if the FTC gets its way, Meta will be forced to give up Instagram and WhatsApp, eliminating “up to half of its ad business,” Jasmine Enberg, vice president and principal analyst at eMarketer, told Quartz earlier this week. The research firm expects Instagram alone to represent 50.5% of Meta’s U.S. ad revenue this year. Instagram and WhatsApp are both critical to Meta’s continued growth as legacy social app Facebook loses momentum with young people. Read on for a look at some of the key takeaways from the trial’s first week, including Zuckerberg’s old emails and the price Meta reportedly tried to pay to avoid the trial altogether. “The FTC kicked off the case with the biggest witness on its list. Only one other witness, the FTC’s economics expert Scott Hemphill, is slated to spend anywhere near as long on the stand as Mr. Zuckerberg,” Holland & Hart antitrust attorney Paul Swanson said in an email to Quartz. “Yet while the FTC confronted Mr. Zuckerberg with cringeworthy emails about Facebook’s schemes to beat back competition in the 2010s, none of that hit the key question: Is Meta currently maintaining a monopoly by virtue of the Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions?” According to Swanson, the agency didn’t get the “critical testimony it needs to show that Meta dominates a narrow market that excludes other social media platforms like TikTok and LinkedIn (MSFT+0.24%).” Swanson added, “Mr. Zuckerberg deftly described a market in which Meta’s power is checked by competition from those companies.” In one example, Zuckerberg argued on the stand that Meta’s “growth slowed down dramatically” due to the rise of TikTok. In another comment, he said he thinks “people spend more time on YouTube than on Facebook and Instagram combined, certainly more than either one independently.” The FTC brought in old emails sent by the Meta CEO, and in one message Zuckerberg floated the idea of spinning off Instagram. He wrote at the time, “As calls to break up the big tech companies grow, there is a non-trivial chance that we will be forced to spin out Instagram and perhaps WhatsApp in the next 5-10 years anyway.” Zuckerberg added, “While most companies resist break-ups, the corporate history is that most companies actually perform better after they’ve been split up.” These comments contrast Meta’s extensive efforts to keep its “family of apps” together under one proverbial roof. The FTC brought in other Zuckerberg emails as evidence, including a 2011 message that called Instagram a “large and viable competitor to us on mobile photos” and a 2012 message that critiqued the teams led by Facebook’s chief tech officer at the time, Mike Schroepfer. “Messenger isn’t beating WhatsApp, Instagram was growing so much faster than us that we had to buy them for $1 billion,” Zuckerberg said. “That’s not exactly killing it,” he added, per a CNN (WBD+0.75%) report. The following year, Facebook’s current chief operating officer, Javier Olivan, shared concerns with Zuckerberg about WhatsApp’s growth. Messages presented in court, according to The Hill, show that Olivan told Zuckerberg that he’d “been thinking hard about this for the past couple of sleepless nights since I am really worried … these guys are the real deal,” he said. Zuckerberg was reportedly worried at the time that WhatsApp could offer features similar to Facebook and “start winning in the U.S. and other markets.” Rebecca Allensworth, an antitrust law expert and Vanderbilt’s associate dean for research, told Quartz on Thursday: “So far, the government has done a good job using Zuckerberg’s own words against him, and he has done a good job deflecting them to the degree possible.” “But there is only so much Zuckerberg can do now to walk back on what he said then,” Allensworth added. “These are the worst facts of the case from Meta’s perspective, and the government laid some important blows.” Sheryl Sandberg, Meta’s former chief operating officer, also took the stand this week. There, the FTC confronted Sandberg about a message she sent in 2011, when Google debuted its now-defunct Facebook clone. Remarking on Google+, she reportedly told staffers that “the most important thing to acknowledge is that for the first time we have real competition and consumers have real choice.” About a year later, Sandberg said she “would block Google” from advertising its rival on Facebook, according to court evidence published by Bloomberg. Sandberg argued that these messages weren’t about putting its rivals at a disadvantage. “I said that to rally the troops,” she countered. Lots of interesting bits surfaced this week. In 2022, for example, Zuckerberg floated purging users’ friend lists as a “potentially crazy idea” to breathe some life into Facebook, according to evidence presented in the trial. Zuckerberg reasoned at the time that “wiping everyone’s graphs and having them start again” could reinvigorate engagement on the service, but it never came to pass. In a call to the FTC’s chair Andrew Ferguson, Zuckerberg tried to convince the agency to settle its antitrust case for $450 million — and later $1 billion, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. The FTC, meanwhile, was looking for a settlement worth 30 times as much, per the Journal. Going forward, “the big thing I’m looking for is some expert testimony on what is the right way to think about the market here and Meta’s alleged monopoly power,” Allensworth said. “So far, on that front, we only have testimony by executives at Meta and potential other competitor (like YouTube) about their perceptions of whether Meta faces meaningful competition from social media companies that are not ‘personal,’ like TikTok and YouTube.” Allensworth added, “Judges tend to put a lot of stock in expert opinion in antitrust cases, especially when it comes to market definition and monopoly power.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances AI responses by combining the generative AI model’s capabilities with information from external data sources, rather than relying solely on the model’s built-in knowledge. In this post, we showcase the custom data connector capability in Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases that makes it straightforward to build RAG workflows with custom input data. Through this capability, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases supports the ingestion of streaming data, which means developers can add, update, or delete data in their knowledge base through direct API calls. Think of the examples of clickstream data, credit card swipes, Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data, log analysis and commodity prices—where both current data and historical trends are important to make a learned decision. Previously, to feed such critical data inputs, you had to first stage it in a supported data source and then either initiate or schedule a data sync job. Based on the quality and quantity of the data, the time to complete this process varied. With custom data connectors, you can quickly ingest specific documents from custom data sources without requiring a full sync and ingest streaming data without the need for intermediary storage. By avoiding time-consuming full syncs and storage steps, you gain faster access to data, reduced latency, and improved application performance. However, with streaming ingestion using custom connectors, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases processes such streaming data without using an intermediary data source, making it available almost immediately. This feature chunks and converts input data into embeddings using your chosen Amazon Bedrock model and stores everything in the backend vector database. This automation applies to both newly created and existing databases, streamlining your workflow so you can focus on building AI applications without worrying about orchestrating data chunking, embeddings generation, or vector store provisioning and indexing. Additionally, this feature provides the ability to ingest specific documents from custom data sources, all while reducing latency and alleviating operational costs for intermediary storage. Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies such as Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Stability AI, and Amazon through a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities you need to build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI. Using Amazon Bedrock, you can experiment with and evaluate top FMs for your use case, privately customize them with your data using techniques such as fine-tuning and RAG, and build agents that execute tasks using your enterprise systems and data sources. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases allows organizations to build fully managed RAG pipelines by augmenting contextual information from private data sources to deliver more relevant, accurate, and customized responses. With Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, you can build applications that are enriched by the context that is received from querying a knowledge base. It enables a faster time to product release by abstracting from the heavy lifting of building pipelines and providing you an out-of-the-box RAG solution, thus reducing the build time for your application. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases supports custom connectors and the ingestion of streaming data, which means you can add, update, or delete data in your knowledge base through direct API calls. For this post, we implement a RAG architecture with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases using a custom connector and topics built with Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) for a user who may be interested to understand stock price trends. Amazon MSK is a streaming data service that manages Apache Kafka infrastructure and operations, making it straightforward to run Apache Kafka applications on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The solution enables real-time analysis of customer feedback through vector embeddings and large language models (LLMs). The following architecture diagram has two components: Preprocessing streaming data workflow noted in letters on the top of the diagram: Runtime execution during user queries noted in numerals at the bottom of the diagram: The implementation follows these high-level steps: To build a generative AI stock analysis tool with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases custom connector, use instructions in the following sections. To try this architecture, deploy the AWS CloudFormation template from this GitHub repository in your AWS account. This template deploys the following components: In the precreated MSK cluster, the required brokers are deployed ready for use. The next step is to use a SageMaker Studio terminal instance to connect to the MSK cluster and create the test stream topic. In this step, you follow the detailed instructions that are mentioned at Create a topic in the Amazon MSK cluster. The following are the general steps involved: To create a knowledge base in Amazon Bedrock, follow these steps: Now, using API calls, you configure the consumer Lambda function so it gets triggered as soon as the input Apache Kafka topic receives data. The Apache Kafka consumer Lambda function reads data from the Apache Kafka topic, decodes it, extracts stock price information, and ingests it into the Amazon Bedrock knowledge base using the custom connector. Now that the required setup is done, you trigger the workflow by ingesting test data into your Apache Kafka topic hosted with the MSK cluster. For best results, repeat this section by changing the .csv input file to show stock price increase or decrease. If the data ingestion and subsequent processing is successful, navigate to the Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases data source page to check the uploaded information. Within the Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases console, you have access to query the ingested data immediately, as shown in the following screenshot. To do that, select an Amazon Bedrock FM that you have access to. In my case, I chose Amazon Nova Lite 1.0, as shown in the following screenshot. When it’s completed, the question, “How is ZVZZT trending?”, yields the results based on the ingested data. Note how Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases shows how it derived the answer, even pointing to the granular data element from its source. To make sure you’re not paying for resources, delete and clean up the resources created. In this post, we showed you how Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases supports custom connectors and the ingestion of streaming data, through which developers can add, update, or delete data in their knowledge base through direct API calls. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases offers fully managed, end-to-end RAG workflows to create highly accurate, low-latency, secure, and custom generative AI applications by incorporating contextual information from your company’s data sources. With this capability, you can quickly ingest specific documents from custom data sources without requiring a full sync, and ingest streaming data without the need for intermediary storage.

Title: Damn the tariffs! Full speed ahead on AI!
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/04/18/damn-tariffs-full-speed-ahead-ai/
Time Published: 2025-04-18T14:58:35Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 10:58 EDT / APRIL 18 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Seemingly oblivious to the faltering economy, new artificial intelligence models kept coming fast and furious this week, especially from OpenAI — and apparently they’re pretty popular. China’s DeepSeek? Not so much, at least with the U.S. government, as a House committee just labeled it a security threat. In perhaps a sign that its massive funding is burning a hole in its pocket, OpenAI is also looking at creating a social network. Perhaps Sam Altman sees an opening, given that TikTok still faces having to shut down in the U.S. and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg tried and failed to pay off the FTC to drop its antitrust lawsuit this week, which could force it to unwind its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. But honestly I don’t really get it any more than I get Elon Musk trying to goose Grok by connecting it to X. IPOs surprisingly aren’t quite dead yet, as Figma filed confidentially this week and Kodiak Robotics said it will go public via a SPAC. But with Trump kicking the economy into a ditch, it’s hard to see any kind of IPO revival. Meanwhile, the tariff gyrations caused tech stocks to plunge again Wednesday, and the overall market fell Thursday too. Nvidia is producing its latest-generation Blackwell AI chips in Arizona with TSMC, and it’s building AI supercomputers in Texas with Foxconn and Wistron — both no doubt in the works for years, even if Trump likely will try to take credit. But that won’t help prevent more troubles from tariffs and other trade limitations, as Nvidia faces a $5.5 billion sales hit from limits on shipping its H20 chip to China. AMD also estimates an $800 million charge from U.S. restrictions on China trade, and ASML missed order expectations amid tariff uncertainty. And surely there’s more trouble coming. No wonder Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang just hopped on a plane to China to smooth things over with officials and local customers. Private equity is staying busy as the stock market creates bargains and targets: Elliott Management has bought up $1.5 billion worth of HPE’s stock. Suffice to say, expect some changes ahead for HPE. Meantime, Intel sold 51% of Altera to Silverlake for $3.4 billion, at a valuation of $8.75 billion — a big haircut from its original acquisition price of $16.7 billion. Google lost another antitrust case, this one on its ad tech offering. But Google will appeal and ad tech is 17% of its business, so the previous case declaring Google Search a monopoly, which awaits a judge’s remedies, remains the bigger deal. If government agencies can still work together in this day and age, it’s not a stretch that a deal involving both cases could happen in place of years of further litigation. The critical CVE Program for tracking cybersecurity vulnerabilities got a last-minute funding reprieve, but it never should have come to this. It’s hard not to feel that we’re one more bad decision by the confederacy of clowns away from disaster. Infrastructure is still getting some big fundraises: Hammerspace raised a hefty $100 million for its Linux-powered data management platform. And Auradine nabbed $153 million to develop bitcoin mining and AI networking hardware. Tech earnings season gets underway in earnest next week with SAP, Tesla, IBM, ServiceNow, Check Point Software, Pegasystems, Intel and Alphabet. The results won’t be nearly as interesting as the outlooks, which surely won’t be robust. Here’s all the news this week from SiliconANGLE and beyond, which you can hear and read more about in John Furrier’s and Dave Vellante’s weekly podcast theCUBE Pod, up on YouTube now.

Title: Freshman Rep. Suhas Subramanyam Blasts Data Centers While Cashing In on the Tech Companies That Own Them
URL: https://freebeacon.com/democrats/freshman-rep-suhas-subramanyam-blasts-data-centers-while-cashing-in-on-the-tech-companies-that-own-them/
Time Published: 2025-04-18T09:00:18Z
Full Content:
He's talking tough on big tech—but banking on their servers. Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, a freshman Democrat who represents Northern Virginia, is sounding the alarm about the large data centers that have cropped up in his district, blasting them as "invasive" pollutants that could attract cyberattacks. Those centers support more than 78,000 jobs in Northern Virginia. And while Subramanyam doesn't want them in his backyard, he owns hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of stock in the companies that own them, records show. Subramanyam is sitting on at least $630,000 worth of stock in companies like Amazon, Meta, and NVIDIA, with holdings potentially in excess of $1 million, according to congressional financial disclosures. The companies own or provide critical support to a lion's share of the Virginia data centers, which help power the internet by storing user data for some of America's largest companies. Subramanyam's district is home to more data centers than any other in the country—but during a recent committee hearing, he portrayed them as a creeping menace. "They seemed like a great idea at the time ... but our community is paying the price now, and we're a cautionary tale for the rest of the country," Subramanyam said, calling the centers "not great for the communities." "[In]the next five years alone, data centers can increase customers bills by up to $276 a year, and people's utility bills may double in the next 7 to 10 years just to power data centers," Subramanyam said. "And the environmental impact is real as well. These green spaces are disappearing. Pollution is rising and water supplies are being stretched thin. It's making reaching our clean energy goals in Virginia nearly impossible." "And it's also a security risk," the congressman continued, warning that Russia or other malign actors would be tempted to target the data center hub which had emerged in his district. "You just look at the Ukraine war. When Russia failed to hack Ukraine’s telecom networks, what did they target? They targeted the data centers." A combination of factors—including tax incentives, an abundance of skilled labor, good climate, and proximity to cable internet infrastructure—has made Northern Virginia an ideal spot for the tech sector's data centers. Should they move elsewhere, Subramanyam's stock portfolio would likely rebound—and the area he represents would lose some $31 billion in economic output, according to the Northern Virginia Technology Council. Subramanyam specifically holds at least $500,000 in NVIDIA and at least $130,000 more in Amazon and Meta, according to his most recent personal financial disclosures. Amazon alone maintains at least 93 data centers in Northern Virginia, according to DataCenters.com, a third-party monitoring website. Meta's data center in Sandston, Va., occupies 450,000 square feet and cost $1 billion, according to the Virginia Economic Development Partnership. And while NVIDIA does not own centers outright, they play an integral role in the data center ecosystem. The company's NVIDIA DGX-Ready Data Center program partners with centers by providing coveted certifications guaranteeing they are optimized to handle the various demands and requirements of their parent companies. Rep. Nick Langworthy (R., N.Y.) sent a message to the companies operating data centers in Subramanyam's district. "We need to focus on keeping America competitive and powering our future," he told the Washington Free Beacon. "If Rep. Subramanyam is too foolish to want these great jobs in his district, bring them to mine!" Subramanyam did not respond to a request for comment.

Netflix had its best quarter ever, according to earnings results announced Thursday afternoon, setting the stakes for Netflix stock moving forward after it emerged as a perhaps surprising stock market safe haven during the recent slump. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos attends a Netflix premiere in February. In its Q1 report released shortly after 4 p.m. EDT market close, Netflix reported its best-ever quarterly earnings per share and revenue numbers. Netflix scored $6.61 EPS ($2.9 billion net income) and $10.54 billion last quarter, besting consensus analyst estimates calling for the entertainment titan to report $5.67 adjusted EPS ($2.5 billion net income) and $10.5 billion in sales, according to FactSet data. The company said it expects $11 billion in sales and $7.03 EPS during the second quarter, topping top and bottom line forecasts of $10.9 billion and $6.25, respectively. Shares of Netflix rose 1.2% to $973 on Thursday, surging another 3% in after-hours trading to nearly $1,000 per share. Netflix has emerged from the 2025 stock losses stronger, gaining 4% since April 2 and 9% year-to-date. That came as the S&P 500 (down 6% since April 2, 10% year-to-date excluding dividends) and the Nasdaq (-7%, -15%) both pulled back as President Donald Trump’s trade war heightened recession concerns. Many analysts herald Netflix stock as a safe parking spot as economic slowdown fears swirl. “If a recession hits, we would expect Netflix subscribers to be sticky as Netflix is a stay-at-home cheap diversion, of the type that has held up well in past recessions,” Rosenblatt analyst Barton Crockett wrote in a Monday note to clients. “Amid recent market volatility, Netflix's strong subscription model with critical entertainment (which historically has performed well in a recession) has made the stock a defensive choice for investors,” Bank of America analysts led by Jessica Reif Ehrlich concurred in a Tuesday note. Netflix has far outperformed other members of the “FAANG” group, smashing returns this year from the other high-growth technology names: Facebook parent Meta (down 14% year-to-date excluding dividends), Amazon (-21%), Apple (-21%) and Google parent Alphabet (-19%). Netflix has also outperformed Disney (-23% year-to-date) and Max parent Warner Bros. Discovery (-23%), though audio streamer Spotify’s 29% gain this year tops Netflix’s. Fellow FAANG constituents Alphabet and Amazon will join Netflix in reporting Q1 earnings next week. Both West Coast titans will deliver results next Thursday. One Community. Many Voices.

Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter The pandemic and strikes were bad enough. But, with entertainment companies struggling to stay in the black amidst Trumpian chaos, a recession could be an extinction-level event. By Alex Weprin Media & Business Writer In March 2009, just a few months after the 2008 stock market crash, Disney CEO Bob Iger gathered company shareholders inside Oakland’s Paramount Theatre, a short drive from Pixar’s headquarters in Emeryville. “We are meeting during perhaps the most difficult economic times of our lifetime. And these are conditions that even the strongest companies can’t fully escape,” Iger told the crowd. “I’m confident, though, that our brands, our products and our people can overcome the challenges ahead.” Eventually, the economy recovered, and so did Disney. But that didn’t diminish the short-term discomfort. As damaging as that crash was, however, the media business had a strong foundation to fall back on; 2008, in fact, represented the peak of pay TV, per Leichtman Research Group, with 87 percent of households, more than 100 million strong, paying their cable or satellite bills every month as entertainment giants reaped their share amid the pain. Related Stories Movies How Movie Studio Spies Size Up the Competition Business Streaming Profit Report: Netflix Leads, Disney Rises, Warner Grows. Is Consolidation Next? Now the economy feels as if it is again on a precipice, with a tariffs-induced shock stinging global markets. But this time, TV’s financial system is radically different. Disney is in many ways a textbook example. Yes, its advertising took a hit in 2008, as did its theme parks business, the result of consumers reexamining vacation plans. But ESPN saw growth, thanks to contractual rate increases and pay TV’s ubiquity. Pay TV was a utility, something every household needed to have, like electricity and water. Now, it is a shell of its former self, with fewer than 70 million households and falling rapidly. Consumers get their entertainment, news and sports through a hodgepodge of streaming services, with some seen as necessities (maybe YouTube and Netflix) and others seen as expendable. And unlike cable TV, unsubscribing is as easy as clicking a button. And while the 2020 pandemic shock worked to the benefit of legacy media entering the streaming fray (bolstered by consumers largely staying home), 2025 is a different beast, with inflationary concerns top of mind and no shortage of other entertainment options available. In an April 10 report titled “never-ending tumult,” Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich noted that “traditionally, cable companies have tended to be viewed as defensive in recessions. This view has been driven by the utility and subscription-based nature of their offerings as well as limited competition against those offerings. However, Cable operators now face increased broadband/video competition vs. prior recessions. This backdrop challenges the traditional perception of Cable companies as safe havens during an economic downturn.” Most know that advertising is always impacted in recessions, but there’s reason to believe that a recession this time could be worse than in downturns past. In 2008, TV was the king of advertising, accounting for the lion’s share of ad spend, according to Magna. Today’s advertising environment is vastly different, with tech giants Google, Meta and Amazon dominating the space with performance-driven ads as TV’s piece of the pie shrinks (though streaming and connected TV ads are growing, albeit not enough to offset linear’s losses). A recession now could be the thing that pushes linear TV off the edge. “Given the ongoing secular headwinds facing the linear TV ecosystem, we worry that television could mirror the fate of radio and newspapers during past recessions,” MoffettNathanson’s Michael Nathanson wrote in an April 9 report, adding that $45 billion in ad revenue could be lost in a recessionary situation. “Should budgets shift away from linear TV at an accelerated pace, we see risk of a more permanent reallocation toward connected TV and broader digital channels.” “We continue to believe that Online advertising will hold up better than traditional TV and other legacy channels,” he continued. “In a more cautious environment, marketers will prioritize performance-driven advertising over broad brand campaigns — a dynamic that favors digital and measurable media.” Media analyst Brad Adgate was an executive at Horizon Media in 2008. He recalls the mass layoffs that the advertising and media businesses went through amid the tumult. “That’s what I remember most vividly,” he says, adding that he sees TV as particularly at risk in this moment. “There’s concern that if the budgets are going to remain flat or even drop, it’s going to be much more pressure on video and television to compete with all the choices marketers have.” But even tech giants are exposed. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy was asked April 10 on CNBC if his company is feeling a pinch in its advertising business. “When you have things like tariffs, it’ll create macro issues where it depresses demand or drives inflation,” he noted. At Warner Bros. Discovery, CEO David Zaslav sent a note to staffers telling them to batten down the hatches and reduce discretionary spending because of “market volatility and reduced consumer confidence.” That said, TV still has an ace up its sleeve in the form of live sports — the NFL in particular. Its scale is unmatched, and advertisers are unlikely to meaningfully scale back their sports investments. Or as Reif-Ehrlich writes: Sports “remain resilient in tepid advertising markets.” But even there, any benefit is splintered and offset. Disney benefits from sports thanks to ESPN, but its theme parks are extraordinarily exposed in a downturn. While Disney and NBCUniversal’s experiences business are brand-defining in most economies, in a recession, their high fixed costs become a burden, as consumers pare spending. Disney and NBCU also have historically benefitted from such consumer products as toys and clothing, where licensing deals mean fat margins for the IP owners. But given the steep tariffs on China and Vietnam, those margins are bring pressured. That said, Reif-Ehrlich notes the opening of Epic Universe could help NBCU manage some of those issues, given likely demand for the entirely new Orlando theme park. Despite all the doom and gloom and the difficult comparison to past recessions, some analysts still see green shoots. The music business is vastly healthier than it was in 2008, when Spotify was still an experiment in Sweden, the record labels were reeling and Apple’s iTunes carried the day. Multiple analysts are framing Spotify and music industry stocks as a safe haven. “We very much doubt that a recession would drive a meaningful increase in churn at what are reasonably priced music subscription services,” TD Cowen’s Doug Creutz wrote April 9. Similarly, Netflix is seen as “more resilient” than other entertainment companies, says Nathanson, given its dominance in subscription streaming and the fact that advertising is not yet a meaningful driver of its business, allowing it breathing room that more established media companies don’t have. Even there, of course, pressure remains. “Tougher macro/recession could delay [Netflix] price increases in certain markets,” JPMorgan’s Doug Anmuth noted on April 8. And yet anxiety remains high, with tariffs and a recession not the only tail risks facing the industry. One media veteran says that entertainment executives they have spoken to are already gaming out scenarios where interest in American popular culture sours and the globalization of entertainment that has spread U.S. franchises and brands around the world begins to reverse in favor of more localized fare. That is a world where some of Hollywood’s greatest strengths — its decades of beloved IP — could work against it, and the ramifications of that new world order, should it come to pass, would be sweeping.

Markets sank sharply on Wednesday after back-to-back tariff-related headlines from Nvidia and the Federal Reserve rattled investor confidence. The sell-off started after a disclosure on Tuesday evening after markets closed from Nvidia, which warned of a $5.5 billion hit due to export rules on H20 AI chips developed for the Chinese market. Nvidia appears to be caught in the increasing tension over tariffs between the US and China. Stock losses deepened after Federal Reserve President Jerome Powell cautioned that renewed tariffs under the Trump administration could create a "challenging scenario" for the economy. He warned that the Fed's dual mandate — low unemployment and price stability— could be tested if tariffs drive up consumer prices while slowing growth. Here is how much each of the Magnificent 7 lost on Wednesday — and since Trump's inauguration — at market closing at 4 p.m. ET, according to Yahoo Finance. Loss in stock value since January 21: 20.51% Loss in stock value on April 16: 2% Alphabet, Google's parent company, took a comparatively smaller loss on Wednesday but still saw about one-fifth of its stock value wiped out since Trump became president. In February, Nvidia replaced Alphabet as Wall Street's third most valuable company. Alphabet donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration. Loss in stock value since January 21: 22.16% Loss in stock value on April 16: 2.93% Amazon, the global e-commerce giant, has lost about one-fifth of its share value since Trump's inauguration and could be hit further by tariffs, especially the up to 245% in duties imposed on China. Amazon donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund, and founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos attended. Small businesses selling on Amazon told Business Insider they are struggling to keep their doors open as their already razor-thin margins shrink further under tariffs. Loss in stock value since January 21: 9.21% Loss in stock value on April 16: 3.89% Apple shares briefly rallied on Monday on a surprise tariff exemption on key tech products, but the reprieve was short-lived. The tech giant is also planning to spend and invest more than $500 billion in the US over the next four years. Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, personally donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee and attended the ceremony. Loss in stock value since January 21: 15.40% Loss in stock value on April 16: 3.68% Meta, parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is currently facing a blockbuster antitrust trial with the Federal Trade Commission that opened on Monday and is expected to run up to eight weeks. The tech giant had donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg attended the ceremony. Loss in stock value since January 21: 9.98% Loss in stock value on April 16: 3.66% Microsoft has been rethinking its performance reviews and is mulling another round of job cuts that could come as soon as May, after already having fired "low-performers" in January. Loss in stock value since January 21: 20.33% Loss in stock value on April 16: 6.87% A main character of Wednesday's stock market woes, Nvidia, the chipmaking giant, took a heavy loss in shares and at one point neared a 10% loss before bouncing back toward market close. The semiconductor maker developed H20 AI chips for China but disclosed Tuesday that new US export restrictions have effectively blocked Nvidia from selling the inventory, which weighed down share values of the broader tech sector. Loss in stock value since January 21: 40.08% Loss in stock value on April 16: 4.94% Tesla, the EV giant, had an especially difficult year in terms of sales and share value for reasons that go beyond tariffs or generally low consumer sentiments. Public backlash over Musk's political involvement and ties to the White House's DOGE office resulted in mass protests and boycotts of Tesla vehicles, and his focus on DOGE made investors question his commitment to the company. Elon Musk has donated over $260 million to support Trump's return to the White House, along with $12 million toward a failed conservative bid in Wisconsin's Supreme Court race. Jump to

Title: PNY GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Overclocked Dual Fan
URL: https://me.pcmag.com/en/graphics-cards/29396/pny-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-overclocked-dual-fan
Time Published: 2025-04-17T01:18:53Z
Full Content:
The GeForce RTX 4060 Ti was arguably Nvidia's least-appealing last-generation graphics card. It shipped for $399 with just 8GB of GDDR6 memory and a crippling 128-bit memory interface, which combined to make it a deeply unappealing option compared with the standard RTX 4060, the RTX 4070, or AMD’s Radeon RX 7700 XT. (Nvidia also released a 16GB version for $499, an even tougher sell.) Today's release of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, available with either 8GB ($379) or 16GB ($429) of GDDR7 video memory, is poised to right some of these wrongs. We've put PNY’s $429 GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Overclocked Dual Fan model through our rigorous tests to see how it fares. While Nvidia, bafflingly, retained its narrow 128-bit memory interface, the RTX 5060 Ti is far more appealing than the RTX 4060 Ti ever was, with GDDR7 offsetting this shortcoming quite well. This point is particularly true when considering the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB launched at $499, with the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB costing a surprising $70 less. The RTX 5060 Ti is ideal for gamers who want to play at 1440p or 1600p, where it can run current games with near-maximum settings while maintaining a smooth refresh rate. That earns it our Editors’ Choice award for mainstream 1440p play. (Gamers looking to run games at 1080p with a high refresh rate would also get a lot of joy from the RTX 5060 Ti, but it's edging on overkill for that resolution.) All this is contingent, of course, on the supply of the GPUs and how the ultimate pricing shakes out for US shoppers, with tariffs and possible shortages looming. The GeForce RTX 5060 Ti houses a GB206 graphics processor based on Nvidia’s "Blackwell" graphics architecture. This is the first desktop graphics card we’ve seen to use this graphics chip, which is similar to the AD106 chip inside the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti but with some enhancements. In addition to the performance boost the Blackwell architecture provides, the RTX 5060 Ti also has a higher core count than the RTX 4060 Ti. It has 36 streaming multiprocessors (SMs) compared with the RTX 4060 Ti’s total of 34. Most of the hardware resources of an Nvidia graphics chip sit inside these SMs, and so this increase brings with it a higher number of CUDA cores, texture mapping units (TMUs), tensor cores, and ray-tracing cores, all of which you can see in the spec chart. Nvidia’s reference design for the RTX 5060 Ti calls for it to be clocked slightly higher than the RTX 4060 Ti. (Note: There is no Founders Edition version of this card.) This increase in clock speed, combined with the bump up in hardware resources, should provide around a 10% increase in performance, in addition to any gains derived from the improved Blackwell architecture. Unfortunately, the RTX 4060 Ti's least appealing feature, its narrow 128-bit memory interface, lives on in the RTX 5060 Ti. Memory bandwidth is essential for driving fast graphics performance, and this design choice hampered the RTX 4060 Ti's performance, particularly at higher resolutions. This 128-bit-wide memory interface is one of the key reasons the RTX 4060 Ti was a bummer of a card. This interface remains a limiting factor on the new Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, but it is far less significant than it was on the 4060 Ti. Nvidia equipped the RTX 5060 Ti with 28Gbps GDDR7 memory, which is far faster than the 18Gbps GDDR6 memory that the 4060 Ti shipped with. This resulted in a greater than 50% increase in overall memory bandwidth (to 448GBps, from 288GBps). Assuming you can find a card at the actual MSRP, you'll also find improvement in this generation in terms of pricing, particularly on the 16GB models. The RTX 4060 Ti launched at $399 for the 8GB model and a prohibitively high price of $499 for the 16GB model, which I genuinely hope no one paid full price for. The 8GB RTX 5060 Ti is a little more affordable than its predecessor at $379, and the 16GB model is much more enticing at $429. I would have considered this a bit high for the RTX 4060 Ti in retrospect due to its memory issues, but as you are about to see, GDDR7 goes a long way to address those limitations. The memory interface on a component like the graphics card essentially works like pipes; think of data as the water. The wider the interface, the more pipes you have, and the more data can travel to or from the graphics chip at any given time. Naturally, if we increase the number of pipes by widening the interface from, say, 128 bits wide (like on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti) to 192 bits wide (like on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070), we enable more data to be in motion between the graphics chip and the VRAM at any given time. We typically measure the bandwidth of how much data can pass through this connection in terms of gigabytes per second, or GBps for short. Widening the memory interface is an effective way to increase the amount of bandwidth a graphics card has. But it comes at a cost: You will need more memory chips, a more complicated PCB, and additional circuitry on the graphics chip itself to support this. All of that naturally will impact the price, but there's an easier way to increase bandwidth: by simply opting for VRAM that runs at a higher speed. Going back to our pipes analogy, this effectively works like increasing the water pressure, forcing more through each second. This is why the adoption of GDDR7 memory for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti is so impactful. This GDDR7 is rated to push 28Gbps (gigabits per second) as opposed to the 18Gbps of the GDDR6 used on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti. The math for calculating bandwidth works like this: Memory interface width in bits x RAM speed = Bandwidth in Gbps From here, all we have to do in order to get the bandwidth in GBps is to divide by eight. Plugging in those numbers for the RTX 4060 Ti, we get this this: 128 x 18 = 2,304Gbps Dividing that by eight gives us a final bandwidth for the RTX 4060 Ti of 288GBps. If we do the same for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, we have the following equation... 128 x 28 = 3,584Gbps ...which then gives us a total bandwidth of 448GBps after dividing by eight. Effectively, this means that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti has roughly 56% more bandwidth than the RTX 4060 Ti while maintaining the same 128-bit interface. This goes a long way to reducing the negative impacts of having a 128-bit bus. Before delving into the benchmark tests, let’s look at the specific RTX 5060 Ti model we received for review. PNY’s GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Overclocked Dual Fan graphics card is a relatively plain model in the series. It lacks RGB lighting and uses a simple dual-fan thermal solution. It also has a metal backplate and occupies only two open expansion slots. This card's rear I/O bracket features three DisplayPort connections and a single HDMI port. For power delivery, this particular PNY card requires just a single 8-pin power connection, which is a refreshing change from the banks of multiple 6-pin or 8-pin connectors or the polarizing, Nvidia-specific 12VHPWR connector that has dominated the higher-end RTX 50-series cards we have tested. PNY suggests a minimum 600-watt PSU for use with this card. We tested the PNY GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Overclocked Dual Fan graphics card on our recently rebuilt graphics card testbed, which features an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X CPU. This CPU is installed on a Gigabyte X870E Aorus Master motherboard with two 16GB sticks of DDR5 RAM in a dual-channel configuration, using an AMD EXPO memory profile to set the RAM to 6,000MHz. The CPU is also cooled by a 360mm Cooler Master liquid cooler. This system is configured with two 2TB Crucial PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSDs, one dedicated to holding games and the other to holding Windows 11 and everything else. It is powered by a 1,500-watt Corsair power supply. As the name indicates, our PNY card has a slight overclock over stock speeds, as indicated by the base/boost clocks in the chart above. Upon launch, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti meets an open playing field in its price range. The AMD Radeon RX 9070 and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 are both $549 MSRP, creating substantial space between them in terms of cost and direct competition. This gap leaves only last-generation graphics cards, like the AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT and Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, to compete with the RTX 5060 Ti near its price point. These older cards can still put up a fight, but as they use older technology, the RTX 5060 Ti has the advantage. The synthetic test results suggest a substantial performance gain when moving from the RTX 4060 Ti to the RTX 5060 Ti across the board. Results against AMD’s Radeon RX 7800 XT were more mixed, but the RX 7800 XT came out ahead more often than not. These test results also clearly show that the RTX 5070 and AMD’s Radeon RX 9070 are far ahead of the RTX 5060 Ti, which is reflected in their shared starting price. UL’s Procyon AI text generation is one of the first reliable tests we have to gauge AI performance. (Testing AI performance in any holistic sense is difficult, particularly as on-card AI muscle addresses a wide range of tasks—training versus inferencing, for one thing. It is impossible with current tools to test a very broad set of AI local-processing scenarios in an all-encompassing way.) This test presses the GPU on a series of text-creation inferencing tasks via four popular AI large language models (LLMs) run locally, and produces an overall score in each case. (Here, Procyon uses versions of Mistral, Microsoft's PHI, and two flavors of Meta AI's Llama.) It also reports how many tokens (or discrete units of text, in the context of text generation) the hardware can produce per second with each model. It also measures the time it takes to produce the first token. Regarding AI performance, the RTX 5060 Ti was once again a notable step ahead of the RTX 4060 Ti. (Note that our RTX 4060 Ti test sample was an 8GB card.) It was substantially faster in all of the tests, and the RTX 5060 Ti ran the Llama 2 tests without issue, whereas the RTX 4060 Ti failed to run those benchmarks. AMD didn't stand much chance here, with the RTX 5060 Ti beating even the Radeon RX 9070 XT in this area in all but three tests. That’s a big deal if you care about AI performance and plan to heavily use local-processed AI in your work or leisure time, but for most people, this likely isn’t important right now. And AI pros aren't buying mainstream consumer cards like these. Using graphics cards for GPU-accelerated content creation tasks is common today, and here, Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 5060 Ti scored a more substantial win over AMD's cards. The RTX 5060 Ti effectively tied with the Radeon RX 9070 XT in Adobe Premiere, and it was far faster than the Radeon RX 7900 GRE in Blender. The RX 9070 XT failed to run the Blender benchmark, but unless it would have nearly doubled the performance of the RX 7900 GRE, it will be slower than the RTX 5060 Ti in this area, too. The RTX 5060 Ti also significantly outpaced the RTX 4060 Ti here. However, I wouldn’t recommend anyone upgrade from the RTX 4060 Ti to the RTX 5060 Ti, as I don’t consider these gains enough to justify the cost of replacing such a recent card. Regardless, you would see a noticeable uplift in many content creation tasks. AMD’s FSR, Intel’s XeSS, and Nvidia’s DLSS technologies work in two ways to algorithmically enhance performance. First, they use algorithms crunched on GPU silicon to upscale images rendered at lower resolutions into sharper images. Second, they similarly use algorithms to generate and insert additional frames between originally rendered frames to boost frame rates. DLSS is the most advanced in this second technique, generating up to three additional frames per raw frame render via what Nvidia calls Multi-Frame Generation in its 50-series cards. Regardless of version, each of these techniques works differently from each other to achieve similar goals, so you should be careful when considering results using these technologies against each other. However, due to the popularity of these techniques, it’s helpful to know how they compare in terms of performance. In these tests, the RTX 5060 Ti outpaced the RTX 4060 Ti again. The RTX 5060 Ti wasn’t a match for the RTX 5070 or the AMD Radeon RX 9070, but it performed similarly to the Radeon RX 7800 XT. With frame generation off, the RX 7800 XT lagged behind the RTX 5060 Ti, but it pulled ahead when this feature was enabled. I do not doubt that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti's GDDR7 memory helps it overcome the limitations of its narrow 128-bit memory interface. Still, as I said earlier, it doesn’t entirely fix the issue. In-game benchmarks give us the best idea of how much of a problem the 128-bit memory interface is, and they clearly show that the issue was much improved. A technical glitch prevented us from testing the RTX 5060 Ti at 1080p in Cyberpunk 2077, but with the resolution set to 1440p and 4K, the RTX 5060 Ti outpaced the RX 7900 GRE and the RX 7800 XT, both of which have wider 256-bit memory interfaces and more memory bandwidth. The RTX 5060 Ti’s improved graphics cores and faster GDDR7 memory speeds enabled it to pull ahead despite this disadvantage in Cyberpunk 2077. It also trounced the RTX 4060 Ti. At 1080p in F1 2024, the RTX 5060 Ti was slightly ahead of AMD’s Radeon RX 7900 GRE before it effectively tied at 1440p and 4K. The RTX 5060 Ti still holds the overall advantage, but it notably dropped further than the RX 7900 GRE when transitioning from 1080p to 1440p. This is likely due to the RTX 5060 Ti having less bandwidth than the RX 7900 GRE. The impact here is slight, but the issues that the narrow 128-bit interface can cause are more evident in Far Cry 6. Typically, if memory bandwidth isn’t a problem, performance tends to scale linearly with resolution. This means most graphics cards tend to have their frame rates drop a similar proportional amount when moving from, say, 1080p to 1440p. When we see one card dropping faster than the others, it's typically a sign of a bottleneck somewhere, and for the RTX 5060 Ti, that’s almost certainly its narrow memory interface. In F1 2024, the impact of this was negligible. The RTX 5060 Ti lost 36% of its frame rate when transitioning from 1080p to 1440p, whereas the RX 7900 GRE dropped by 33%. This is enough difference to close the performance gap between the two, but not much else. This is far more noticeable in Far Cry 6, where the RTX 5060 Ti went from having a significant lead over the Radeon RX 7900 GRE and the Radeon RX 7800 XT at 1080p to being slower than both at 1440p and 4K. From 1080p to 1440p, the RTX 5060 Ti dropped 22% of its performance while the RX 7900 GRE only lost 8%. Both dropped a fair bit when cranking the resolution up to 4K, but the RTX 5060 Ti remained behind. A similar situation is observable in Returnal, where the RX 7900 GRE tied with the RTX 5060 Ti at 1080p, but the RX 7900 GRE came out on top at 1440p and 4K. This is again likely due to the RTX 5060 Ti's memory-bandwidth limitations brought about by the card's narrow 128-bit interface. The RTX 5060 Ti was behind the RX 7900 GRE at all resolutions in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, and this likely wasn't a result of the limited memory bandwidth. The bandwidth constraints of the RTX 5060 Ti aren't likely to impede 1080p resolutions, which the performance in the other games we tested supports—the RTX 5060 Ti is generally faster at 1080p. Instead, AMD's win here is likely due to better optimization for AMD hardware in these two games. In games that don’t support ray tracing, like Total War: Three Kingdoms and Shadow of the Tomb Raider, AMD’s previous-generation Radeon RX 7900 GRE and Radeon RX 7800 XT held a sizable lead over the RTX 5060 Ti. Those cards struggled to compete with the RTX 5060 Ti in games with ray-tracing support as their ray-tracing hardware is less robust, but if ray tracing is out of the equation, they can handily beat the RTX 5060 Ti. The Radeon RX 7900 GRE's and RX 7800 XT’s performance triumph in Shadow of the Tomb Raider, in particular, was helped by the RTX 5060 Ti’s narrow memory interface, which again held it back at 1440p and 4K. We use a Kill-A-Watt wall meter to measure the power consumption of our graphics card testbed as a whole during select tests to gauge the power draw of each tested graphics card. Power consumption in gaming increased a fair bit from the RTX 4060 Ti to the RTX 5060 Ti. The performance increase outweighs this increase in power draw, but drawing more power is never ideal. However, the RTX 5060 Ti’s power consumption was considerably lower than that of the AMD competition, except for the faster Radeon RX 9070, which is more efficient overall. The gaming thermals we recorded from the PNY GeForce RTX 5060 Ti weren’t terrible, but they certainly could have been better. Most of the other graphics cards in the chart stayed cooler during the testing process. Different models of the RTX 5060 Ti with more robust thermal solutions could perform better here. However, it isn’t strictly necessary, as 70 degrees C is within the safe operating range for a modern graphics card.

The GeForce RTX 4060 Ti was arguably Nvidia's least-appealing last-generation graphics card. It shipped for $399 with just 8GB of GDDR6 memory and a crippling 128-bit memory interface, which combined to make it a deeply unappealing option compared with the standard RTX 4060, the RTX 4070, or AMD’s Radeon RX 7700 XT. (Nvidia also released a 16GB version for $499, an even tougher sell.) Today's release of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, available with either 8GB ($379) or 16GB ($429) of GDDR7 video memory, is poised to right some of these wrongs. We've put PNY’s $429 GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Overclocked Dual Fan model through our rigorous tests to see how it fares. While Nvidia, bafflingly, retained its narrow 128-bit memory interface, the RTX 5060 Ti is far more appealing than the RTX 4060 Ti ever was, with GDDR7 offsetting this shortcoming quite well. This point is particularly true when considering the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB launched at $499, with the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB costing a surprising $70 less. The RTX 5060 Ti is ideal for gamers who want to play at 1440p or 1600p, where it can run current games with near-maximum settings while maintaining a smooth refresh rate. That earns it our Editors’ Choice award for mainstream 1440p play. (Gamers looking to run games at 1080p with a high refresh rate would also get a lot of joy from the RTX 5060 Ti, but it's edging on overkill for that resolution.) All this is contingent, of course, on the supply of the GPUs and how the ultimate pricing shakes out for US shoppers, with tariffs and possible shortages looming. The GeForce RTX 5060 Ti houses a GB206 graphics processor based on Nvidia’s "Blackwell" graphics architecture. This is the first desktop graphics card we’ve seen to use this graphics chip, which is similar to the AD106 chip inside the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti but with some enhancements. In addition to the performance boost the Blackwell architecture provides, the RTX 5060 Ti also has a higher core count than the RTX 4060 Ti. It has 36 streaming multiprocessors (SMs) compared with the RTX 4060 Ti’s total of 34. Most of the hardware resources of an Nvidia graphics chip sit inside these SMs, and so this increase brings with it a higher number of CUDA cores, texture mapping units (TMUs), tensor cores, and ray-tracing cores, all of which you can see in the spec chart. Nvidia’s reference design for the RTX 5060 Ti calls for it to be clocked slightly higher than the RTX 4060 Ti. (Note: There is no Founders Edition version of this card.) This increase in clock speed, combined with the bump up in hardware resources, should provide around a 10% increase in performance, in addition to any gains derived from the improved Blackwell architecture. Unfortunately, the RTX 4060 Ti's least appealing feature, its narrow 128-bit memory interface, lives on in the RTX 5060 Ti. Memory bandwidth is essential for driving fast graphics performance, and this design choice hampered the RTX 4060 Ti's performance, particularly at higher resolutions. This 128-bit-wide memory interface is one of the key reasons the RTX 4060 Ti was a bummer of a card. This interface remains a limiting factor on the new Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, but it is far less significant than it was on the 4060 Ti. Nvidia equipped the RTX 5060 Ti with 28Gbps GDDR7 memory, which is far faster than the 18Gbps GDDR6 memory that the 4060 Ti shipped with. This resulted in a greater than 50% increase in overall memory bandwidth (to 448GBps, from 288GBps). Assuming you can find a card at the actual MSRP, you'll also find improvement in this generation in terms of pricing, particularly on the 16GB models. The RTX 4060 Ti launched at $399 for the 8GB model and a prohibitively high price of $499 for the 16GB model, which I genuinely hope no one paid full price for. The 8GB RTX 5060 Ti is a little more affordable than its predecessor at $379, and the 16GB model is much more enticing at $429. I would have considered this a bit high for the RTX 4060 Ti in retrospect due to its memory issues, but as you are about to see, GDDR7 goes a long way to address those limitations. The memory interface on a component like the graphics card essentially works like pipes; think of data as the water. The wider the interface, the more pipes you have, and the more data can travel to or from the graphics chip at any given time. Naturally, if we increase the number of pipes by widening the interface from, say, 128 bits wide (like on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti) to 192 bits wide (like on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070), we enable more data to be in motion between the graphics chip and the VRAM at any given time. We typically measure the bandwidth of how much data can pass through this connection in terms of gigabytes per second, or GBps for short. Widening the memory interface is an effective way to increase the amount of bandwidth a graphics card has. But it comes at a cost: You will need more memory chips, a more complicated PCB, and additional circuitry on the graphics chip itself to support this. All of that naturally will impact the price, but there's an easier way to increase bandwidth: by simply opting for VRAM that runs at a higher speed. Going back to our pipes analogy, this effectively works like increasing the water pressure, forcing more through each second. This is why the adoption of GDDR7 memory for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti is so impactful. This GDDR7 is rated to push 28Gbps (gigabits per second) as opposed to the 18Gbps of the GDDR6 used on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti. The math for calculating bandwidth works like this: Memory interface width in bits x RAM speed = Bandwidth in Gbps From here, all we have to do in order to get the bandwidth in GBps is to divide by eight. Plugging in those numbers for the RTX 4060 Ti, we get this this: 128 x 18 = 2,304Gbps Dividing that by eight gives us a final bandwidth for the RTX 4060 Ti of 288GBps. If we do the same for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, we have the following equation... 128 x 28 = 3,584Gbps ...which then gives us a total bandwidth of 448GBps after dividing by eight. Effectively, this means that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti has roughly 56% more bandwidth than the RTX 4060 Ti while maintaining the same 128-bit interface. This goes a long way to reducing the negative impacts of having a 128-bit bus. Before delving into the benchmark tests, let’s look at the specific RTX 5060 Ti model we received for review. PNY’s GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Overclocked Dual Fan graphics card is a relatively plain model in the series. It lacks RGB lighting and uses a simple dual-fan thermal solution. It also has a metal backplate and occupies only two open expansion slots. This card's rear I/O bracket features three DisplayPort connections and a single HDMI port. For power delivery, this particular PNY card requires just a single 8-pin power connection, which is a refreshing change from the banks of multiple 6-pin or 8-pin connectors or the polarizing, Nvidia-specific 12VHPWR connector that has dominated the higher-end RTX 50-series cards we have tested. PNY suggests a minimum 600-watt PSU for use with this card. We tested the PNY GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Overclocked Dual Fan graphics card on our recently rebuilt graphics card testbed, which features an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X CPU. This CPU is installed on a Gigabyte X870E Aorus Master motherboard with two 16GB sticks of DDR5 RAM in a dual-channel configuration, using an AMD EXPO memory profile to set the RAM to 6,000MHz. The CPU is also cooled by a 360mm Cooler Master liquid cooler. This system is configured with two 2TB Crucial PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSDs, one dedicated to holding games and the other to holding Windows 11 and everything else. It is powered by a 1,500-watt Corsair power supply. As the name indicates, our PNY card has a slight overclock over stock speeds, as indicated by the base/boost clocks in the chart above. Upon launch, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti meets an open playing field in its price range. The AMD Radeon RX 9070 and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 are both $549 MSRP, creating substantial space between them in terms of cost and direct competition. This gap leaves only last-generation graphics cards, like the AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT and Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, to compete with the RTX 5060 Ti near its price point. These older cards can still put up a fight, but as they use older technology, the RTX 5060 Ti has the advantage. The synthetic test results suggest a substantial performance gain when moving from the RTX 4060 Ti to the RTX 5060 Ti across the board. Results against AMD’s Radeon RX 7800 XT were more mixed, but the RX 7800 XT came out ahead more often than not. These test results also clearly show that the RTX 5070 and AMD’s Radeon RX 9070 are far ahead of the RTX 5060 Ti, which is reflected in their shared starting price. UL’s Procyon AI text generation is one of the first reliable tests we have to gauge AI performance. (Testing AI performance in any holistic sense is difficult, particularly as on-card AI muscle addresses a wide range of tasks—training versus inferencing, for one thing. It is impossible with current tools to test a very broad set of AI local-processing scenarios in an all-encompassing way.) This test presses the GPU on a series of text-creation inferencing tasks via four popular AI large language models (LLMs) run locally, and produces an overall score in each case. (Here, Procyon uses versions of Mistral, Microsoft's PHI, and two flavors of Meta AI's Llama.) It also reports how many tokens (or discrete units of text, in the context of text generation) the hardware can produce per second with each model. It also measures the time it takes to produce the first token. Regarding AI performance, the RTX 5060 Ti was once again a notable step ahead of the RTX 4060 Ti. (Note that our RTX 4060 Ti test sample was an 8GB card.) It was substantially faster in all of the tests, and the RTX 5060 Ti ran the Llama 2 tests without issue, whereas the RTX 4060 Ti failed to run those benchmarks. AMD didn't stand much chance here, with the RTX 5060 Ti beating even the Radeon RX 9070 XT in this area in all but three tests. That’s a big deal if you care about AI performance and plan to heavily use local-processed AI in your work or leisure time, but for most people, this likely isn’t important right now. And AI pros aren't buying mainstream consumer cards like these. Using graphics cards for GPU-accelerated content creation tasks is common today, and here, Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 5060 Ti scored a more substantial win over AMD's cards. The RTX 5060 Ti effectively tied with the Radeon RX 9070 XT in Adobe Premiere, and it was far faster than the Radeon RX 7900 GRE in Blender. The RX 9070 XT failed to run the Blender benchmark, but unless it would have nearly doubled the performance of the RX 7900 GRE, it will be slower than the RTX 5060 Ti in this area, too. The RTX 5060 Ti also significantly outpaced the RTX 4060 Ti here. However, I wouldn’t recommend anyone upgrade from the RTX 4060 Ti to the RTX 5060 Ti, as I don’t consider these gains enough to justify the cost of replacing such a recent card. Regardless, you would see a noticeable uplift in many content creation tasks. AMD’s FSR, Intel’s XeSS, and Nvidia’s DLSS technologies work in two ways to algorithmically enhance performance. First, they use algorithms crunched on GPU silicon to upscale images rendered at lower resolutions into sharper images. Second, they similarly use algorithms to generate and insert additional frames between originally rendered frames to boost frame rates. DLSS is the most advanced in this second technique, generating up to three additional frames per raw frame render via what Nvidia calls Multi-Frame Generation in its 50-series cards. Regardless of version, each of these techniques works differently from each other to achieve similar goals, so you should be careful when considering results using these technologies against each other. However, due to the popularity of these techniques, it’s helpful to know how they compare in terms of performance. In these tests, the RTX 5060 Ti outpaced the RTX 4060 Ti again. The RTX 5060 Ti wasn’t a match for the RTX 5070 or the AMD Radeon RX 9070, but it performed similarly to the Radeon RX 7800 XT. With frame generation off, the RX 7800 XT lagged behind the RTX 5060 Ti, but it pulled ahead when this feature was enabled. I do not doubt that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti's GDDR7 memory helps it overcome the limitations of its narrow 128-bit memory interface. Still, as I said earlier, it doesn’t entirely fix the issue. In-game benchmarks give us the best idea of how much of a problem the 128-bit memory interface is, and they clearly show that the issue was much improved. A technical glitch prevented us from testing the RTX 5060 Ti at 1080p in Cyberpunk 2077, but with the resolution set to 1440p and 4K, the RTX 5060 Ti outpaced the RX 7900 GRE and the RX 7800 XT, both of which have wider 256-bit memory interfaces and more memory bandwidth. The RTX 5060 Ti’s improved graphics cores and faster GDDR7 memory speeds enabled it to pull ahead despite this disadvantage in Cyberpunk 2077. It also trounced the RTX 4060 Ti. At 1080p in F1 2024, the RTX 5060 Ti was slightly ahead of AMD’s Radeon RX 7900 GRE before it effectively tied at 1440p and 4K. The RTX 5060 Ti still holds the overall advantage, but it notably dropped further than the RX 7900 GRE when transitioning from 1080p to 1440p. This is likely due to the RTX 5060 Ti having less bandwidth than the RX 7900 GRE. The impact here is slight, but the issues that the narrow 128-bit interface can cause are more evident in Far Cry 6. Typically, if memory bandwidth isn’t a problem, performance tends to scale linearly with resolution. This means most graphics cards tend to have their frame rates drop a similar proportional amount when moving from, say, 1080p to 1440p. When we see one card dropping faster than the others, it's typically a sign of a bottleneck somewhere, and for the RTX 5060 Ti, that’s almost certainly its narrow memory interface. In F1 2024, the impact of this was negligible. The RTX 5060 Ti lost 36% of its frame rate when transitioning from 1080p to 1440p, whereas the RX 7900 GRE dropped by 33%.

Both dropped a fair bit when cranking the resolution up to 4K, but the RTX 5060 Ti remained behind.

April 16, 2025 18:15 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On March 27, 2025, investors in AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) saw the price of their shares drop $65.92, wiping out about $20 billion of the company’s market value, after prominent short seller Muddy Waters Research revealed its short position in the stock. Muddy Waters’ report comes on the heels of a recently filed securities class action lawsuit, captioned Quiero v. AppLovin Corporation, et al., No. 4:25-cv-02294 (N.D. Cal.). The suit seeks to represent investors who purchased AppLovin securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Hagens Berman is investigating the claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Recent Development: On March 27, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a scathing report titled “AppLovin: Deep Data Analysis Shows APP is Just Another Scammy AdTech Company.” The report’s focus is in part on “retargeting” (a strategy that aims to re-engage potential customers who have previously interacted with a brand), “incrementality” (the additional or incremental lift in sales or conversions that a marketing activity generates), and AppLovin’s compliance with third party platforms’ TOS (terms of service). Muddy Waters contends that “APP e-commerce is Mostly Retargeting, Incrementality is Low, and it Clearly Violates Platforms’ TOS.” Muddy Waters alleges that: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Securities Class Action: The Muddy Waters report follows the filing of a securities class action complaint alleging AppLovin made false and misleading statements, while failing to disclose critical details about its flagship AXON 2.0 digital advertising platform. The company had heavily promoted the platform as "the best and fastest-growing product we’ve ever released." Investors were allegedly led to believe that the platform, which reportedly leverages “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would redefine the digital advertising landscape by enhancing ad placement efficiency and expanding into e-commerce and web-based marketing. However, the alleged narrative first shifted on February 26, 2025, when short sellers Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research published damaging reports that raised pointed questions about the company’s claims. Both research firms accused AppLovin of misleading investors regarding the platform's true capabilities and ethical practices. Fuzzy Panda Research alleged that the company violated app store policies by exploiting user data in questionable ways, predicting that tech giants Apple and Google would ban AppLovin from their app stores. Additionally, they accused AppLovin of “stealing data from Meta” as part of its e-commerce initiatives, foreseeing swift retaliation from Meta. Culper Research criticized the company for allegedly using AXON 2.0 as little more than a promotional facade to obscure the real drivers behind its business strategy. Culper's report further claimed that AppLovin's growth in mobile gaming has relied on “systematic exploitation of app permissions that enable advertisements themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations onto users’ phones, with just a single click – an event that is often inadvertent thanks to the Company’s notorious UX gimmicks” and that “each illicit install translates directly to profit.” “We are investigating claims that AppLovin may have misled investors about whether its growth may be attributable to illegitimate conduct,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Netflix (NFLX) is slated to report first-quarter results after markets close Thursday, and options markets suggest traders are expecting a big stock price move in the following days. Netflix options pricing on Wednesday signaled the stock is expected to move approximately 8.5% in either direction in the week after Thursday’s report, suggesting a stock-price range of between $893.47 and $1,059.09. (U.S. financial markets are closed on Friday, which means any big move in the stock won't happen until next week.) Uncertainty is high heading into Netflix’s report, and that uneasiness is reflected in options prices for nearly all stocks. “The market is pricing in the highest average implied moves since 1Q20,” wrote JPMorgan analysts in a note on Monday. By their calculations, the average implied earnings-day move for the stocks they cover is 8.1% this quarter, compared with a realized average of 6.5% last quarter and 5.9% over the last three years. In the same note, JPMorgan compared the historical post-earnings moves of the 60 largest S&P 500 stocks and their implied volatility this quarter. They found Netflix was among the stocks with the most underestimated—or "cheapest"—post-earnings volatility. Over the past three years, the stock’s post-earnings move has averaged about 11%, making it and Meta Platforms (META) the most volatile names in JPMorgan's sample. Netflix's "cheap" implied volatility puts it in the minority. Traders are pricing in smaller-than-average moves for only nine of the 60 largest stocks in the S&P 500, according to JPMorgan's analysis. Tech giants Nvidia (NVDA), Meta, Broadcom (AVGO) and Oracle (ORCL) are among those nine. Netflix stock has jumped following each of its last two earnings reports. Shares advanced nearly 10% the day after fourth-quarter earnings topped estimates in January. The company also raised its revenue forecast for 2025 and boosted its share buyback program by $15 billion. In October of last year, Netflix beat expectations for its top and bottom lines, and indicated strong demand for its ad-supported subscription tier, sending shares soaring more than 11% the next day. Netflix stock popped on Tuesday after a report that the streaming giant is aiming to double its revenue to about $78 billion by 2030, an ambitious goal that the company hopes will propel it into the $1 trillion market-capitalization club alongside tech giants like Alphabet (GOOG) and Amazon (AMZN). Analysts are generally bullish on Netflix stock heading into earnings. Oppenheimer on Monday stuck by its “buy” rating and $1,150 price target—among the highest on Wall Street—and expressed confidence the streamer will be mostly insulated from tariffs and an economic slowdown. Netflix shares fell 1.5% on Wednesday amid a broad sell-off. Even with the decline, the company's shares are up about 8% so far this year and have risen 56% over the past 12 months.

Title: Netflix Set To Kick Off Earnings Season Well Positioned As Wall Street Weighs Recession Risk
URL: http://deadline.com/2025/04/netflix-q1-2025-earnings-tariffs-wall-street-media-1236368789/
Time Published: 2025-04-16T14:33:11Z

By Jill Goldsmith Co-Business Editor Netflix unveils its first-quarter results Thursday afternoon. The report will kick off a rather momentous earnings season for media amid churning stock markets and recession jitters prompted by the Trump administration’s global tariffs. Traditionally the company that fires the starting gun for entertainment and tech numbers every three months, Netflix may be a calming place to start this time. As tariffs cast a pall across business sectors including media, the streaming giant may be Wall Street‘s top stock pick to weather the macroeconomic storm. Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein calls it the “cleanest story” in media in the case of a U.S. or global recession. The company has little tariff exposure, sustainable 2025 growth, strong engagement data and has gotten to the other side of a round of price increases, which bug customers but enthuse profit-hungry investors. This will be the first quarter when Netflix doesn’t report subscriber numbers, but it has a number of other metrics to trumpet and has been solidly profitable for years, a claim most other streaming players can’t yet make. Watch on Deadline Netflix is only minimally exposed to advertising, which right now is ideal, after introducing a cheaper ad tier less than three years ago. A nascent business is less exposed as low consumer confidence, anticipated inflation and economic uncertainty have Wall Streeters warning of an advertising pullback. Advertising makes up a big chunk of revenue and profit at companies like Fox Corp., Paramount Global and Warner Bros Discovery to Meta and Snap. The ad business was hit hard during the past two recessions and slow to recover, which left leaving the media landscape transformed. “Given the ongoing secular headwinds facing the linear TV ecosystem, we worry that television could mirror the fate of radio and newspapers during past recessions,” research firm MoffettNathanson wrote in a recent client note. “Should budgets shift away from linear TV at an accelerated pace, we see risk of a more permanent reallocation towards connected TV and broader digital channels.” He see $45 billion in lost U.S. advertising spend versus current forecasts if GDP growth slows in 2025. To limit downside risk, the firm’s Michael Nathanson pinpoints Netflix and Alphabet as “offering compelling entry points.” The firm has “buy” recommendations on both, as well as on Disney, WBD and Meta. It has “hold” ratings on Fox, Paramount, Roku and Snap. But it also said it’s waiting to revise forecasts ahead of “further clarity during earnings calls.” It’s an understatement to say that CEO commentary over the next few weeks is highly anticipated. Beyond advertising, analysts fret about parks, which generate key revenue at Disney and Comcast, with the latter’s NBCUniversal division set to open Epic Universe in May. Nathanson notes that historical recessions (in 2001-2002 and 2008-2009) squeezed domestic parks. In the event of a recession, he predicted, Disney’s U.S. revenue would be several billion dollars below his estimates for both this year and next. Trump’s tariffs have angered U.S. allies. Airlines are sounding a cautionary note and analysts in that sector note dips in foreign travel to the U.S. in March from the year before. Jessica Reif Ehrlich of BofA Securities think Epic Universe could provide a nice boost to the sector in trying times, along with new Disney cruise ships and a rise in per capital spending at Disney parks. That said, BofA has had to rethink its outlook. “Entering the year, we were bullish on the Media & Entertainment industry in part driven by a potential cycle of M&A, but this thesis has clearly not played out (and appears unlikely) given the current Administration’s unfavorable view of some companies in our coverage,” Reif Ehrlich wrote in a note to clients. Media and entertainment, in a state of seemingly never-ending tumult, navigating Covid and then Hollywood talent strikes over the past few years, “now faces the economic uncertainty and market volatility created by the risk of tariffs.” BofA economists are not forecasting a recession but see a drag on growth that could bring the economy to the precipice. “While typical recession risk mainly impacts revenue, tariffs could lead to higher costs,” the analyst noted, in areas like raw materials for sets, or a loss of foreign tax incentives for production. She sees Netflix and Spotify as best-positioned in the field and preferred buys as both have nascent ad businesses and strong subscription models with “critical entertainment which historically performs well in a recession.” Oppenheimer’s Helfstein says that Netflix could be confronted with higher churn, weaker gross subscriber additions or subscribers trading down to cheaper plans given the deteriorating economic picture. Still, he says the firm sees “limited risk overall.” Citing a 2011 Stanford survey, he said consumers spend more time at home during economic hardship, and time spent watching TV increased during the last U.S. recession. (And we all remember the explosion of viewing and sign-ups in 2020.) Netflix is offering both secular growth, as it embarks on a new advertising revenue strategy among selective price increases, says David Joyce of Seaport Research, calling it “the best of both worlds as the low price points globally offer a great deal of value for the engagement levels – which is exhibited in good times and bad.” Generally, what makes Netflix and other streamers a “defensive stay-cation alternative if we enter a recession is that it’s likely to be one of the last expenditures cut from a consumer’s budget.” A monthly premium subscription is cheaper than a sporting event, a concert and even an Imax ticket. Although exhibitors also tend to benefit in economic downturns. He has a buy on the stock. The first quarter brought one of the company’s biggest hits ever, Adolescence, showing continued momentum after it blew past estimates to top 303 million subscribers as of the end of 2024. Loop Capital’s Alan Gould said the Ted Sarandos- and Greg Peters-led streamer should be among the most economically resilient companies in the current climate and least impacted by tariffs. For the first three months of 2025, Gould is forecasting $10.54 billion in revenue; operating income of $3 billion; net income of $2.456 billion; and diluted earnings per share of $5.63. Wall Street consensus is close at $10.51 billion of revenue; just under $3 billion in operating income; $2.473 million net profit; and EPS of $5.67, he noted, as per investment researcher VisibleAlpha. “Both we and the Street and us are expecting a small revenue, operating income and EPS beat. The quarter will benefit from about a half quarter of the price increase in the UCAN region and a month in the UK. As discussed in our March 24 report, here, engagement appears to have been up 5% for the quarter based on NFLX’s weekly Top 10 global titles in English, non-English, film and series,” Gould said in a report yesterday. “Engagement was down for the 4 weeks from late February to mid-March, coinciding with 1 month after the US price increase was fully in effect, but engagement has since bounced back the past 3 weeks.” Any and all financial metrics will be taking on increased significance when company reports after market close Thursday because – and this is big – it will be the first quarter ever Netflix won’t be revealing monthly subscriber numbers. That prospect freaked out analysts when it was floated last year although some say it has the benefit of tamping down some of the volatility around the stock, which can get buffeted subscriber numbers from quarter to quarter. Netflix has said that it will still provide that data in certain situations, like when it hits milestones. It also will likely continue characterizing growth in its ad-supported tier, using montly active users (MAUs) as the key metric, which is different from subscribers. Upbeat sentiment on the streamer accelerated this week after a WSJ report that the company’s top brass shared some ambitious goals at an annual business review with senior staff – namely, plans to achieve a $1 trillion market cap and double its revenue by 2030. The outlook included growth targets for ad sales – of $9 billion globally by 2030, and tripling operating income from $10 billion in 2024. The saga of tariffs – imposed under a Trump declared “national emergency” in foreign trade – has been fast-moving, hard to follow and value-destroying. On April 2, the administration announced sweeping tariffs targeting 60 countries with a baseline 10% tariff on nearly all remaining imports that had not been taxed already, calling it Liberation Day. Trump then announced hefty, additional reciprocal tariffs on most countries, tanking markets. He later walked those back to allow for negotiations. When China publicly chastised the administration, Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%. China quickly confirmed will cut back imports of Hollywood films, which could impact media company revenue. Last Friday, Trump suspended tariffs on electronics like iPhone and laptops from China – where most are made. But the administration also said it’s probing the “whole” tech supply chain, meaning products like chips and semiconductors may not be excluded from tariffs. He also has hinted yesterday that he might give tariff relief to certain automakers to give them more time to move production the U.S. Relief also might also extend to car components. Tariffs on a major trading partner, the European Union, will likely stay in place as negotiations appear to have stalled, according to a number of developments on Tuesday. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who has been putting out sometimes twice-daily updates on the tariff situation in recent weeks, said Tuesday that “the price impacts from this head-scratching tariff slate could result in demand destruction of 15%-20%” for new car purchases in the U.S. this year. That would add $100 million to automakers’ costs and raise the price of new cars by up to $15K. Automakers are a key advertising category. Trump’s goal is to move production back to the U.S., but that would take years after decades of globalization. “We reiterate the concept of a U.S. made car with all U.S. parts is a fairy tale fictional narrative” and not even possible now, Ives wrote. Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson has also been among those pointing out that a shift by Apple from China-based iPhone production to American manufacturing for the device, which accounts for half of the tech giant’s revenue, would take decades. Given the uncertainty, companies are unlikely to commit capital based on protectionist policies that may not last beyond 2028, Nathanson said. Entertainment, unlike auto parts or lumber or liquor or shoes, is a service, not a good, so not subject to tariffs. Of the more than 300 CEOs surveyed in April by an industry group called Chief Executive that conducts monthly polls, 62% saw a recession or other economic downturn in the next six months – up from 48% who had that forecast in March. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said during a recent interview that the U.S. may already be in a recession or getting close to one due to Trump’s tariffs. The tariff debate escalated as banks were out with quarterly numbers, the first sector to report each earnings season. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said Monday the prospect of a recession has increased amid the uncertainties of a trade war alongside growing indications that economic global economic activity is slowing. Influential JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon also said tariffs could spur inflation, weaker economic growth and, potentially, a recession. “Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,” he said in his annual letter to shareholders Monday.

Title: The FTC Discredited Its Case Against Meta In Its Opening Statement

ByJohn Tamny ByJohn Tamny, Contributor. WASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 14: The Dome of the U.S. Capitol Building is visible as FTC attorney Daniel ... More Matheson departs E. Barrett Prettyman United States Court House on April 14, 2025 in Washington, DC. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has begun an antitrust trial against Meta over the company's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp and allegations that the company holds a monopoly over the social networking market. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) “They decided that competition was too hard and it would be easier to buy out their rivals than to compete with them.” Those were the words of FTC lawyer Daniel Matheson in the opening statement of the FTC’s antitrust case against Meta. Matheson unwittingly exposed his own argument as meritless. To understand why, it’s important to remember that when Facebook purchased Instagram in April of 2012, it could claim just 30 million users at a time when Facebook’s users were already in the billion category. Which is a comment that FTC and Matheson are rewriting history in an attempt to make their case. If readers are confused, consider yet again that Instagram could claim all of 30 million users when its acquisition was announced. So, while it should be said that antitrust is always and everywhere an unfortunate look backwards by government lawyers constrained by the known, it’s no wonder that the Barack Obama DOJ and FTC didn’t raise an objection to Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram. The simple truth is that Instagram was largely unknown in 2012, and as an unknown, not at all a Facebook rival or peer. Evidence supporting the above claim can be found in the price Facebook paid for Instagram: $1 billion in cash and stock. Sorry, but such a purchase wasn’t evidence of a social media giant in Facebook buying its way out of competitive pressures, rather it was Mark Zuckerberg speculating on a future of social media that brought new meaning to opaque. In other words, if Instagram had even somewhat appeared as a future threat to Facebook or Facebook’s competition, there would have been a ferocious bidding war for Instagram that would have pushed its purchase price far, far above $1 billion. From there, consider Meta’s U.S. sales in 2025. Instagram presently accounts for 50 percent. Looking back to 2012, if Instagram had at all been seen as such a substantial future source of Facebook or Meta revenues, then the 2012 buyout price for it would once again have been far, far above $1 billion. Yet Matheson is basing his case on Facebook spending what was even then a somewhat piddling sum to ward off its oncoming status as a has-been victim of Schumpeterian “creative destruction”? Such a view isn’t serious. What is serious and dangerous at the same time is that Meta and Zuckerberg are being forced to spend precious time in court for having seen the future of social media much more clearly than their rivals. In other words, rather than rest on his wildly successful Facebook laurels, the future-seeing Zuckerberg worked feverishly to discover ways to continue to meet, and much more important, lead the needs of a social media user base that had alternate options then, and still does now. It all raises a question: since when is vastly improving the user experience with free services the stuff of antitrust violations? Tick tock, tick tock. All of which brings us back to how Matheson framed his opening statement, and most notably the case-neutering line about Facebook buying out its rivals rather than competing with them. Which means Matheson is basing his gossamer thin argument on the easy-to-discredit notion that 2012 resembled 2025 in a commercial sense. Except that it didn’t, and Meta still has its $1 billion receipt from its Instagram purchase to prove that it didn’t.

Title: 'I don't know how you couldn't be embarrassed': Wall Street is rethinking its Trump bet

Good morning. Bill Gates says AI is coming for a slew of jobs, including two that once seemed tech-proof: teachers and doctors. What will be left for us humans to do? "Retire early," Gates said. In today's big story, Wall Street dealmakers thought Trump was the answer. Now, they're not so sure. What's on deck Markets: Why I want to work on Wall Street: College students explain. Tech: OpenAI is on a hiring spree, and one area of investment stands out. Business: Realtors and Zillow are going to war, but homebuyers will pay the price. But first, Wall Street is having doubts. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. "I don't know how you couldn't be embarrassed," a managing director at a middle market-focused investment bank told BI. They were talking about the many soothsayers in Wall Street's C-suites who had bet that the new administration would revive a comatose dealmaking market. Things haven't quite worked out that way. Goldman Sachs said that the paralyzed deal market dragged revenue from deal work down 22% in the first quarter, compared with the same period last year. On every bank's Q1 earnings calls in recent days, one person loomed large: President Donald Trump. No CEOs mentioned him by name. Instead, they talked about uncertainty, worried clients, and a concerning economic outlook, BI's Reed Alexander writes. "While our corporate and consumer clients are resilient and in good financial health, the world is in a wait-and-see mode and is facing a more negative macro outlook than anyone had anticipated at the beginning of the year," Jane Fraser, the CEO of Citigroup, said. Behind the scenes, bankers told BI that they were feeling less diplomatic about the Trump administration and its tariff policies: "If you're an executive in finance and you talk to clients frequently and you understand how the world works, there's no way you can't be upset." A fuller picture of how Trump is impacting Wall Street may not emerge until the next earnings season later this summer. Many of the worst days of recent volatility happened in April — the second quarter. Whether the White House will care is another matter. 1. Netflix: Sell-off, who? Netflix's shares have climbed more than 10% in 2025, outperforming its mega-cap tech peers and a struggling broader market. Some analysts consider the stock to be recession-resistant. 2. Bring it on, Wall Street. A career path in finance can be notoriously brutal, but young people are embracing it anyway. More than 150 Wall Street-bound college students told BI their hopes, fears, and reservations about launching careers in the industry. 3. Should investors go risk-on again or stay defensive? President Trump recently hinted at a potential exemption for the auto industry. It's not the first time he's walked back on tariffs, and some investors are questioning if they should stop taking his remaining tariff threats seriously. 1. OpenAI's hiring spree. The AI startup's looking for new talent as it ramps up its infrastructure ambitions. Dozens of open roles related to AI infrastructure are listed on its website. 2. Zuck still seems salty about a failed deal from 12 years ago. Mark Zuckerberg's failed Snapchat bid from 2013 resurfaced at Meta's antitrust trial, and it doesn't sound like he's over it. He told the court Meta would've accelerated Snap's growth if the deal went through, FWIW. 3. Alphabet's supply-chain project is going solo. Chorus, Alphabet's bet on optimizing the global supply chain, is becoming an independent company, its CEO told BI. After several years under Alphabet's X incubator, the companies believe spinning it off will help Chorus move faster. 1. Realtors and Zillow are going to war. Last week, Zillow unveiled a new rule that would ban home listings that are initially selectively marketed to the public. The move takes direct aim at giant real estate brokerages — and it's bound to start an ugly fight. 2. This app wants to pay you to shop. No, it's not a scam. Claim gives users money to redeem at partner businesses each week. Its CEO told BI he wants it to disrupt the advertising sector and help combat the youth loneliness epidemic. Here's how it works. 3. Fewer planes in the skies. United Airlines announced it's cutting domestic flights by 4% starting in July, citing less travel demand. The company said it was "impossible to predict this year with any degree of confidence." The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York (on parental leave).

(NASDAQ: MRVI), e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE: ELF), and Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ:MANH). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) Class Period: May 10, 2023 - February 25, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 The AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period created the false impression that AppLovin’s enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform, in addition to its “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. In truth, AppLovin was exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices that forced unwanted apps on customers via a “backdoor installation scheme” which inaccurately inflated installation numbers, and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. The AppLovin class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 26, 2025, analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. On this news, the price of AppLovin shares fell by more than 12%, the AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges. For more information on the AppLovin class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/APP Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVI) Class Period: August 7, 2024 - February 24, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 On February 25, 2025, before the market opened, Maravai announced it was postponing its fiscal 2024 earnings release and would delay filing its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. The Company had identified an error in revenue recognition that “resulted in approximately $3.9 million in revenue being recorded in the final week of the second quarter of 2024 upon shipment when it should have been recorded in the first week of the third quarter of 2024 upon receipt by the customer.” The Company had identified “a material weakness in its internal controls over revenue recognition.” Maravai also required additional time to “complete its assessment of a potential non-cash impairment charge related to goodwill associated with its previous acquisition of Alphazyme LLC.” On this news, the Company’s share price fell $0.87, or 21.70%, to close at $3.14 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Maravai lacked adequate internal controls over financial reporting related to revenue recognition; (2) as a result, the Company inaccurately recognized revenue on certain transactions during fiscal 2024; (3) its goodwill was overstated; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

(NASDAQ:MANH) Class Period: October 22, 2024 - January 28, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2025 The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants provided investors with material information concerning Manhattan Associates' expected revenue for the fiscal year 2025. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Defendants' statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company's ability to forecast guidance despite macroeconomic fluctuations, the growth potential of their professional services offerings, and the ability for their cloud revenue to drive revenue for its professional services. On January 28, 2025, Manhattan Associates issued a press release reporting its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. Among other items, the Company disclosed services revenue of $119.5 million for the quarter, growing by only 0.3% compared to the year-ago quarter and falling approximately $2 million short of the guidance provided in October 2024. Manhattan Associates attributed the results to delays in professional services work and deferred deals, predicting that the Company's services revenue would reach a low point in the first quarter of 2025 and that solid revenue growth would not resume until mid-year. Manhattan Associates further revealed emerging challenges in its services business, noting that around 10% of customers with ongoing implementations had scaled back their planned services work for the upcoming calendar and fiscal year. The Company also announced that its 2025 revenues would see modest growth of just 2% to 3%, while GAAP EPS was expected to decline by 10% to 13%. On this news, Manhattan Associates' stock price fell $72.26 per share, or 24.49%, to close at $222.84 per share on January 29, 2025. Then, on February 10, 2025, Manhattan Associates announced that Eddie Capel, Manhattan's President and Chief Executive Officer, would retire from those positions effective February 12, 2025. On this news, Manhattan Associates' stock price fell $23.20 per share, or 11.55%, to close at $177.70 per share on February 10, 2025.
