In 2022, roughly 60% of U.S. households had some stock exposure and the share of Americans trading stocks directly rose to 21% from 2001. But not everyone who invests in stocks becomes wealthy. Investing requires patience, research and wisdom. Let's look at a success story for inspiration and ideas. In July last year, an investor shared his success story, detailed portfolio and tips on r/Dividends, a discussion board on Reddit with over 600,000 members. Don't Miss: These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends Warren Buffett once said, "If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die." These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever. From $25k to $438K Portfolio and $20,000 in Dividends The investor said he started investing at the age of 44 with $25,000. At the time of his post, he was 50 and his portfolio value had reached $438,000. But that's not it. He had about $20,100 in estimated dividend income from his portfolio. "Wish I’d have started when I was 20, I’d be retired now. Remember it's never too late to start so don't give up," he said. The investor said his income averaged about $60,000 to $100,000 per year, but his expenses were low, at around $2,000 per month. He said he always managed to "dump" extra cash in the stock market. "I sold anything in my home I didn't need and put the money into the portfolio. You'll be surprised what you can sell on FB Marketplace. I also put an ad on Craigslist saying I would take anything for free. I sold some things people gave me for a few hundred $'s and added this to the portfolio." Trending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! He also shared details on his contributions during the discussion: "Some years I was able to put away up to $35k per year, other years less. I bought index funds and oil stocks at first; my dividends weren't at the forefront because I didn't know any better. Once I had built up a portfolio and interest rates rose, I moved some money from riskier oil stocks to VTI and VUSXX." Portfolio Value Doubled Thanks to ‘Stupid Risks' In Oil Stocks But how did his portfolio go from $25,000 to $438,000? In addition to compounding, the investor's risky bets paid off. "I managed to double my portfolio by taking some stupid risks in oil stocks that happened to work out well. Could have quite easily gone the other way," he said while answering a question. The investor advised Redditors to start investing from whatever they had, even with $50 and let the compounding effect work over the long run. However, he urged investors not to forget the real goal of investing and the purpose of money. Trending: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. "We spend too much time becoming financially agitated thinking about money. My friend died of cancer at 41 years old and didn't enjoy anything he had saved throughout his working life. Yes, be responsible but enjoy yourself." He said that since he started investing late, he took high risks, invested in oil and tech stocks and kept taking profits, with a goal of early retirement. However, he was now investing in a money-market fund to enjoy high yields. "I've owned lots of traditional dividend stocks like AT&T, Verizon and XOM over the years but now I'm heavily in the safety of VUSXX route for now while it's paying 5%." The investor shared detailed screenshots of his portfolio. Let's examine some of his biggest positions. Trending: Wondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg?

To explore the cost-effectiveness of midomafetamine-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) compared to placebo with therapy (PT) in US healthcare settings. A health state-transition model was used to analyze the cost-effectiveness of MDMA-AT for treating patients with chronic PTSD of moderate or higher severity. Both treatment arms consisted of 3 preparation (90-min), 3 interventional (8-h), and 9 integration (90-min) sessions, lasting ~4 months total. All sessions included psychotherapy, with interventional also including MDMA or placebo. After receiving treatment, patients were distributed across health states of No PTSD (not meeting PTSD diagnostic criteria), Non-Severe PTSD (treatment responders), Severe PTSD (treatment non-responders), and death. Each state had unique healthcare costs and utilities sourced from real-world data analysis and patient data from MDMA-AT clinical trials (including long-term follow-up). The base-case analysis considered the payer’s perspective with a 5-year horizon, 3.5% annual cost and effect discounts, and an assumed MDMA medication price of $12,000 per session. Trial-derived utilities and US life tables mortality data were used to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The main outcome was an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with a $150,000 willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold. The base-case ICER was $83,845 per QALY. Total direct costs were $64,745 in the MDMA-AT and $33,132 in the PT arms ($31,613 increment). The costs of intervention were $48,376 for MDMA-AT and $12,376 for PT. The highest MDMA medication cost to fit under the WTP threshold was $20,314 per session. Costs related to PTSD healthcare visits and other PTSD treatments were lower with MDMA-AT than PT (-$2,511 and -$1,877 increments, respectively). Utility benefits were higher in MDMA-AT than PT, with 3.691 and 3.314 QALYs generated over 5 years, respectively (0.377 QALY increment). These data suggest MDMA-AT may be a cost-effective treatment compared to PT for patients with chronic PTSD of moderate or higher severity.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) represents a psychiatric syndrome caused by exposure to different types of traumatic events, mostly related to war, sexual abuse, or natural disasters [1]. Studies have shown that the annual PTSD prevalence rate in the US population is up to 9.1% among civilians and 50.2% among military personnel [2]. Not all individuals who are exposed to trauma develop PTSD; onset depends on the nature and severity of trauma and the duration of trauma-related symptoms. However, some population subgroups are more prone to developing PTSD, such as females, those facing childhood adversities, patients with mental health conditions, and individuals with low socioeconomic status or a lack of social support [3]. Chronic PTSD is diagnosed when the traumatized patient fails to recover from a traumatic event and is frequently followed by depression, anxiety, and substance abuse [1, 3]. PTSD is associated with high economic and long-term health outcome burden. The incremental economic burden of US individuals with PTSD compared to those without PTSD in 2018 was estimated at $19.6 thousand per patient. The excess expenditures were also higher among military personnel than civilians ($25.7 thousand and $18.6 thousand per patient, respectively). Additionally, PTSD diagnosis is associated with an increased premature mortality risk of approximately 1.2 times in US civilians and 1.8 times in the US military population [4]. Treatment options for the clinical management of PTSD include psychotherapies and pharmacological interventions [1]. Psychotherapy helps patients cope with and overcome trauma, while medications from different pharmacological classes are used to reduce symptom severity associated with PTSD and other comorbid mental health conditions [1, 5]. Clinical guidelines also consider the augmentation of psychotherapy with pharmacological interventions [6]. However, there are still many challenges associated with PTSD treatments. Available pharmacotherapies used to treat PTSD symptoms typically require long-term use to maintain clinical benefits. This often results in the occurrence of adverse events, leading to treatment discontinuation and worsening symptoms [7]. Additionally, some first-line psychotherapies and pharmacological interventions have shown high treatment failure rates in clinical trials, with many patients retaining PTSD symptoms and frequent dropout [8]. Midomafetamine used in combination with psychological intervention (MDMA-AT) is an investigational treatment approach being evaluated by Lykos Therapeutics for adult patients with PTSD. Although the exact mechanism of action is unclear, it is hypothesized that the synergistic effects of combined midomafetamine and manualized psychotherapy treatment more directly impact pathological PTSD mechanisms rather than only suppressing the symptoms. By affecting the serotoninergic activity in the left amygdala, midomafetamine is thought to alter the trauma processing in PTSD patients by attenuating fear, reducing reactions to stress triggers, eliminating chronic hyperarousal, and decreasing defensiveness without blocking access to memories or preventing a deep and genuine experience of emotion. The effects of midomafetamine is therefore proposed to augment manualized psychotherapy during MDMA-AT sessions [9, 10]. Phase III randomized clinical trials (RCTs) reported significant efficacy of investigational MDMA-AT compared to placebo with therapy in terms of reducing symptom severity in participants with chronic PTSD of moderate or higher severity. The treatment course consisted of only three MDMA sessions in combination with psychological intervention and close patient observations. Adverse events that occurred were typically transient, mild to moderate severity, and promptly managed [11, 12]. The challenges of current PTSD treatments suggest the need for novel clinical interventions to treat patients. MDMA-AT demonstrates the potential to address this unmet need in the current PTSD treatment landscape. Although efficacy and safety were shown in clinical trials, the cost-effectiveness of this intervention remains unclear. This health economic model aims to explore the cost-effectiveness of the MDMA-AT for treating patients with chronic PTSD of moderate or higher severity in the US healthcare setting. Model development and reporting of findings are aligned with the updated Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist [13]. The research is based on the principles of mathematical modeling, published peer-reviewed literature, publicly available US statistics, and de-identified clinical trial data. The study does not require ethics board approval as there are no relevant or potential conflicts with ethical principles in medicine and research. Clinical trial data supporting the study findings were used under license from Lykos Therapeutics and are publicly unavailable. Data access may be granted by the authors upon reasonable request and gained approval from Lykos Therapeutics. Any data that might be shared would be released via a data use agreement. The model development and cost-effectiveness analysis were performed using Microsoft Office Excel® software (version Office 365). Clinical trial data were analyzed using the IBM SPSS Statistics® software (version 23.0). A health state transition economic model with a cost-effectiveness analysis was developed from the payer perspective. The modeling time frame was 25 years with implemented annual cycles. The model population included patients with chronic PTSD of moderate or higher disease severity. The treatment included three interventional MDMA-AT sessions as well as preparation and integration psychotherapy sessions based on clinical trial protocols [9, 11, 12]. Briefly, participants received three 90-minute preparation psychotherapy sessions prior to the first MDMA-AT session. Each interventional MDMA-AT session lasted 8 hours and consisted of MDMA administration, psychotherapy, and close patient monitoring by two trained therapists. MDMA was administered as a split dose of 80 mg and 40 mg (120 mg total) during the first MDMA-AT session and as a split dose of 120 mg and 60 mg (180 mg total) in the second and third sessions. MDMA-AT treatment sessions were spaced approximately four weeks apart followed by three weekly 90-minute integration sessions comprised of psychotherapy alone with two therapists. For all preparation, interventional, and integration sessions, a manualized psychotherapy approach was used. Manualized psychotherapy is inner-directed and designed to invite inquiry and facilitate a therapeutic effect by providing support for approaching difficult material that does not interfere with the participant’s spontaneous experience. The model comparator was identical to the protocol used in the MDMA-AT arm including manualized psychotherapy, but patients were administered placebo instead of MDMA during the interventional sessions. The modeling was based on data from MAPP1 and MAPP2 studies–two randomized, double-blind, phase III clinical trials comparing MDMA-AT to placebo with therapy administration in participants with chronic PTSD of moderate or higher disease severity [11, 12]. After completing the phase III trials, some participants were included in the long-term follow-up study (MPLONG) which was used to estimate the durability of treatment effects. Model health states were No PTSD, Non-severe PTSD, Severe PTSD, and death. At model initiation, all patients had moderate or higher severity PTSD; therefore, they were classified in the Non-severe or Severe PTSD health states. After receiving treatment with MDMA-AT or placebo with therapy (4-month post-treatment endpoint), patients transitioned to other health states based on the treatment response: Loss of PTSD diagnosis in clinical trials was defined as not meeting PTSD diagnostic criteria after treatment according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and measured using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5). Treatment response was defined as a clinically relevant CAPS-5 score decrease of at least 10 points. As such, more effective treatment would be depicted by a higher rate of patients in the No PTSD state, while less effective treatment would show higher rates of patients with Non-severe and Severe PTSD. The durability of treatment effects was assessed in the follow-up MPLONG study of MAPP1 and MAPP2 participants. Data from this long-term observational study were analyzed to obtain transitioning rates between the model states at the MPLONG endpoint by applying the previously explained criteria. The mean follow-up duration in the MPLONG trial was 17 months for participants with moderate or higher severity PTSD. Patient distribution among health states at the 1-year endpoint was estimated using distribution data at trial enrollment, the 4-month post-treatment endpoint, and the 17-month long-term follow-up endpoint. The proportion of patients in the No PTSD state treated with MDMA-AT at these endpoints was graphically represented with the proportion of sample as the y-axis and time in months as the x-axis. Using the best-fit method (log model), proportions were extrapolated over time and extracted for a 1-year time point. The difference between the proportions of patients in the No PTSD state at the estimated time point and a previous time point was equally distributed between the Non-severe and Severe PTSD states. The patient distribution at the 1-year time point was employed for the first annual cycle, while distribution of patients extracted from the MPLONG trial was used for all other consecutive model cycles (from 2nd annual cycle to the maximum 25th annual cycle) due to the lack of data in the literature. The same method was used to estimate transitioning rates between the model health states among patients treated with the placebo with therapy comparator. Briefly, the model started when the target population initiated the treatment with MDMA-AT or the placebo with therapy comparator. After the treatment course (4 months for the MAPP1 and MAPP2 trials), patients were stratified into one of the health states (No PTSD, Non-severe PTSD, and Severe PTSD). Each state had its own PTSD treatment costs, healthcare visit costs, utilities, and mortality rates. Afterwards, patients were observed over the long-term follow-up (MPLONG trial) and redistributed across health states based on the changes in their health status. Healthcare costs, utilities, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) at relevant endpoints were calculated. The full model scheme diagram is shown in Fig 1.

Healthcare cost inputs were pooled from a PTSD burden of illness (BOI) study based on real-world evidence data. The cohorts in the BOI analysis match the model health states (No PTSD = Baseline PTSD, Non-severe PTSD = PTSD without comorbidities, and Severe PTSD = PTSD with comorbidities). PTSD economic burden and treatment characteristics in the BOI analysis were assessed during the 2-year follow-up period [15]. Healthcare costs included three components: intervention treatment costs (MDMA-AT or placebo with therapy), healthcare visits for PTSD, and regular PTSD treatments (psychotherapy or medication). Intervention costs were one-time expenditures in the model paid for MDMA-AT or placebo with therapy. According to the clinical trial protocols [11, 12], there were three interventional sessions (MDMA or placebo administration with 8-hour psychotherapy) with a total of nine integration and three preparation 90-minute psychotherapy sessions provided by two therapists. Hence, the MDMA-AT intervention cost was the sum of three preparation psychotherapy sessions, three MDMA-AT sessions (which included the estimated MDMA medication price plus eight hours of psychotherapy), and nine integration psychotherapy sessions. The comparator intervention cost included only expenditures related to the psychotherapy components (three preparation, three placebo with therapy, and nine integration sessions). The cost of a single preparation or integration session was pooled from the BOI analysis using an average 90-minute psychotherapy session cost multiplied by two (the number of therapists per session). The cost of a single 8-hour session (480 minutes) was estimated from a 90-minute psychotherapy cost input by multiplying with a time coefficient (480 minutes divided by 90 minutes) and the number of therapists (2 therapists). The second cost component represents healthcare expenditures associated with PTSD services provided in outpatient, inpatient, and emergency department (ED) settings. PTSD-related visit costs per cohort from BOI analysis were used to estimate the average monthly cost of PTSD-related healthcare services per model health state. To calculate the PTSD visit costs for MDMA-AT and the placebo with therapy comparator, the monthly PTSD visit costs per health state were multiplied by the rate of patients in each health state that received respective intervention treatment and summed per model arm. The average monthly PTSD visit costs were multiplied by the annual rate (12, for the total number of months) to estimate PTSD visit expenditures per model cycle, and then multiplied by model endpoint duration (i.e., 1-year, 5-year, 10-year…) to determine the total PTSD visit costs. The final component of healthcare costs was regular PTSD treatment expenditures including psychotherapy, FDA-approved medications, and off-label medications. Psychotherapy utilization rates and the number of sessions per month were extracted from the MPLONG data. The monthly psychotherapy cost per model state was calculated using monthly utilization data from MPLONG and the average cost of psychotherapy sessions from the BOI analysis. Medication utilization rates were not available from the MPLONG data and were therefore determined from BOI analysis. The monthly medication expenditures (FDA-approved and off-label separately) were estimated using the utilization rates per cohort and 2-year costs related to the medication group from BOI analysis. The 2-year medication group costs were divided by 24 months to estimate a mean cost on a monthly level. The monthly PTSD treatment costs for model health states were the sum of monthly psychotherapy, FDA-approved medication, and off-label medication expenditures per respective state. The same method as for the PTSD visit costs was applied to calculate monthly PTSD treatment costs per model arm (MDMA-AT or placebo with therapy) using the results per health state. Since other PTSD treatments were not allowed during the MAPP1 and MAPP2 trials, PTSD treatment costs were not included in the calculation while patients were receiving MDMA-AT or placebo with therapy sessions (until the end of the 4th month in the model). Health-related utility values were measured with the European Quality of Life—5 Dimension—5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) tool in MAPP1, MAPP2, and MPLONG trials. Using the post-treatment and long-term follow-up results for each health state per study arm, the 1-year values were estimated by applying the previously explained modeling method. The utility values for MDMA-AT were derived by summarizing the multiplied results of patient distribution across health states in the intervention arm and utility values per each health state in the same arm. The calculation was also applied to gain utility estimates for the placebo with therapy comparator at all endpoints. The base-case analysis included patients with PTSD of moderate or higher disease severity, the economic burden from the payer’s perspective, a 5-year modeling time horizon, and 3.5% annual discount rates on cost and utility inputs. A brief description of all model input parameters and relevant data sources for base-case analysis are presented in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313569.t001 Discount rates of 3.5% per year of modeling were applied to cost and utility inputs. The pre-defined willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was $150,000. ICER was the main study outcome, calculated as the ratio of healthcare costs increment and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) increment between MDMA-AT and psychotherapy. Abbreviations: ICER–Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio; MDMA-AT–MDMA-assisted therapy; PT–placebo with therapy; QALY–Quality-adjusted life years Univariate one-way sensitivity analysis (OWSA) was implemented in the model to denote which input parameters had the greatest impact on study findings. By varying input values in a specified range (±10%), the impact of each parameter was presented in a tornado chart. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) assessed the reliability of study findings by showing the impact of uncertainty regarding model inputs. By running a high number of iterations (varying input values 5,000 times according to the assigned data distribution), the results were reported as the ICER of mean cost increment and mean QALY increment, a scatter plot of all cost and QALY increments (each dot representing the result of a single simulation), and a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. Scenario analysis with a goal-seek function was also implemented in the model. This analysis calculated the maximum MDMA-AT session cost at which the ICER is equal to the WTP threshold. It also provided ICER values for decreasing MDMA-AT cost per session estimate. The base-case analysis ICER (patients with PTSD of moderate and higher severity, payer perspective, 5-year horizon, and 3.5% annual cost and utility discounts) is $83,845 per QALY. MDMA-AT is a cost-effective treatment compared to the placebo with therapy comparator in the base-case setting. The cost of MDMA-AT treatment was $48,376 ($36,000 for MDMA and $12,376 for all psychotherapy components of MDMA-AT), with a $16,125 price for a single MDMA-AT session ($12,000 for MDMA, $2,357 for 8-hour psychotherapy, and $1,768 for preparation and integration sessions). The total cost of the placebo with therapy was $12,376. Total direct PTSD costs over a 5-year time horizon were $64,745 for the MDMA-AT arm and $33,132 for the placebo with therapy arm ($31,612 incremental cost). The cost difference was mainly driven by the intervention costs, with a much higher cost in MDMA-AT than in placebo with therapy ($48,376 and $12,376, respectively). However, MDMA-AT had lower costs related to PTSD visits ($4,831 compared to $7,342 in placebo with therapy) and PTSD treatment expenditures ($11,538 compared to $13,414 in placebo with therapy). Unlike the healthcare costs, utility outcomes were more beneficial for MDMA-AT than placebo with therapy (3.691 QALY vs. 3.314 QALY, respectively). The cost-effectiveness chart using the base-case scenario and $150,000 WTP threshold is presented in Fig 2. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313569.g002 OWSA with a 10% variation rate denoted utility inputs as parameters with the highest impact on findings. Lowering MDMA-AT utility in the No PTSD category for 2–25 model cycles by 10% yielded an ICER of $247,773 per QALY, while increasing the value by 10% provided an ICER of $50,460 per QALY. After varying MDMA-AT utility in the No PTSD category for the first model cycle by +10% or -10%, ICER values were $71,549 and $101,243 per QALY, respectively.

The mean direct PTSD expenditures for base-case analysis were $64,805 in the MDMA-AT arm and $33,106 in the placebo with therapy arm, yielding a mean cost increment of $31,699 (±5,378 standard deviation). The average QALY increment was 0.376 (±0.305 standard deviation) with mean utilities of 3.691 in the MDMA-AT arm and 3.315 in the placebo with therapy arm. The estimated ICER using the mean increments was $84,240 per QALY. These findings were consistent with the main results, establishing the cost-effectiveness superiority of MDMA-AT over the placebo with therapy comparator. The acceptability of MDMA-AT compared to placebo with therapy was 72.12% at the $150,000 WTP threshold and 60.16% at the $100,000 WTP threshold.

Abbreviations: WTP–Willingness-to-pay. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313569.g005 Scenario analysis calculated the maximum MDMA medication cost per session with the base-case analysis ICER equal to the pre-defined WTP threshold. It was demonstrated that a maximum MDMA medication price of $20,314 per session yielded an ICER of $149,998 per QALY, meeting a WTP threshold of $150,000. Besides the maximum price, scenario analysis provided an overview of ICER value distribution at lower MDMA medication costs. The maximum MDMA medication price to fit under the $100,000 WTP threshold was $14,030 per session, while $7,746 per session was a maximum cost for WTP threshold of $50,000. This cost-effectiveness analysis estimated the healthcare costs per QALY in patients with chronic PTSD of moderate or higher severity, comparing MDMA-AT and placebo with therapy. Model inputs were based on data from three clinical trials (two phase III and one long-term follow-up), a real-world economic BOI analysis, and treatment patterns in modern clinical practice to minimize assumptions and provide the most accurate price estimate. The analysis yielded a cost of $48,376 for the MDMA-AT treatment course, including three preparation 90-minute sessions ($442 per session), three interventional sessions consisting of MDMA medication administration ($12,000 per session) and 8-hour psychotherapy ($2,357 per session), and nine 90-minute integration psychotherapy sessions ($442 per session). Using these cost estimates, the reported ICER was $83,845 per QALY. This was considered cost-effective as the WTP value in the model was $150,000 per QALY. The threshold was defined by the World Health Organization recommendation stating that the cost-effective boundary should be between one and three times the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita [16]. The World Bank data for 2022 reported $76,329.58 GDP per capita for the US [17], yielding a cost-effective threshold range between $76,330 and $228,989 per QALY, which corresponds to the MDMA medication cost of $11,056 to$30,242 per session. However, the authors used a median value (approximately $150,000) to have a fair comparison and considered it relevant for the modern US healthcare system. Regarding sensitivity analyses, univariate OWSA (10% parameter variation) identified utility changes due to MDMA-AT treatment as the most impactful parameter on study findings. The results were also consistent with 5,000 simulations in PSA. The ICER was lower than the WTP threshold in 72.12% of iterations. There are several published cost-effectiveness analyses including MDMA-AT for PTSD treatment. The most recent was published in 2022 by Marseille et al., including phase III clinical trial findings. Although the model had a different design than this study and was based on the Markov principles, it also demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of MDMA-AT over the standard of care comparator with ICER of $47,554 per QALY at 1-year follow-up. In addition, standard of care was dominated by MDMA-AT at 10- and 30-year periods after receiving the intervention. The cost of full-course MDMA-AT treatment was $11,537 per patient [18]. However, the Marseille et al. model was based on multiple assumptions due to a lack of real-world economic and treatment patterns data. The authors used only MAPP1 clinical trial data as MAPP2 and MPLONG trials were not available at the time. Therefore, the Marseille et al. model was developed for patients with chronic severe PTSD, excluding those with moderate disease severity. Also, the long-term follow-up estimate may not be reliable since the phase III trial followed patients for only 4 months, and the model horizon covered a 30-year period after MDMA-AT administration. Another Marseille et al. economic model with an identical design used the findings of six phase 2 clinical trials in which MDMA-AT showed superiority to the standard of care arm among chronic, severe, treatment-resistant PTSD patients. MDMA-AT was cost-effective at 1-year endpoint (ICER $26,427 per QALY) and dominated standard of care at 10- and 30-year periods. The estimated price of two MDMA-AT (which included two interventional sessions) was $7,543 per patient. However, the model was based on small sample trials in patients with severe and treatment-resistant PTSD. Although the findings from a long-term assessment of phase II trials completers were incorporated in the model (mean follow-up 45.4 months), it included only 19 patients, which significantly limited the generalizability of results on 1,000 patients for the 30-year period [19]. Unlike the previous MDMA-AT health economic models, the inputs in this study were purely based on the real-world evidence and data of two phase III clinical trials, including a long-term observation of a larger sample of participants, to provide the best possible estimate. Despite the model covering 25-year period, primary findings presented benefits for a shorter time horizon (5 years), ensuring a higher level of reliability since the average length of follow-up in MPLONG from the parent trial baseline was 17 months. In addition, the long-term phase II clinical trial conducted by Mithoefer et al. demonstrated sustainable effects of MDMA-AT during an average of 3.8-year follow-up period, without significant changes in CAPS scores compared to baseline [20]. Mavranezouli et al. performed a network meta-analysis using available literature sources, supplemented by expert opinion, to populate a health economic model that compared 10 PTSD interventions with no treatment from the UK healthcare setting perspective [21]. The authors pointed out substantial between-study heterogeneity, mainly originating from the differences in PTSD patient characteristics and included interventions, which significantly affect the reliability of the findings. The results imply that Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) was the most cost-effective PTSD intervention, with a 1.8 QALY increment and £33,928 net monetary benefit (NMB) per patient. EMDR was followed by combined somatic/cognitive therapies (£33,364 NMB), self-help with support (£32,880 NMB), and psychoeducation (£32,754 NMB). The most cost-effective medication treatment compared to no treatment was the use of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with an NMB of £32,316 [21]. A systematic literature review by von der Warth et al. captured all economic evaluations of PTSD patients published until February 2020 regardless of the sample population, traumatic experience, or intervention type. The findings denoted that most published studies were low-to-moderate quality, lacked relevant reported information, and had inappropriate designs. Trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) was the most assessed treatment with an ICER of $13,162 per QALY gained compared to usual treatment and $39,366 per additional PTSD remission compared to breathing retraining and psychoeducation comparator. Authors identified the need for accurate and comprehensive economic evaluations of PTSD interventions [22]. Hence, our study addresses this unmet need in the published literature by providing precise estimates of PTSD economic burden and extensive reporting of model findings. The health economic analyses of medications in PTSD are lacking in the published literature, with limited studies that evaluate cost-effectiveness of pharmacological treatments for PTSD. Mihalopoulos et al. [23] compared SSRIs and trauma-focused CBT to standard treatment practice for adults with PTSD in the Australian healthcare setting. The median ICER for trauma-focused CBT was $19,000 per QALY, with 100% uncertainty iterations falling beneath a $50,000 per QALY threshold. SSRIs showed a much lower ICER of only $200 per QALY, most likely due to a very low price, but the results were highly uncertain [23]. Another cost-effectiveness analysis by Le et al. [24] compared prolonged exposure psychotherapy to sertraline in a double-randomized treatment preference trial. Prolonged exposure psychotherapy was dominant to sertraline treatment with lower healthcare costs (-$262) and more QALY gained (0.056). The probability of cost-effectiveness with a $100,000 per QALY threshold was 93.2% [24]. Unlike other health economic models, this study provides highly precise estimates by utilizing real-world economic BOI and treatment patterns data of patients with PTSD instead of previously published literature. Analyzing individual patient data from clinical trials instead of using aggregated published results also increased the reliability of model findings. However, as with other health economic models, the study has several limitations that should be considered while interpreting the results. The main limitation refers to the BOI study and clinical trials used to populate the model inputs. Any limitations regarding inputs from these sources directly apply to this economic evaluation as well. The second limitation is the generalizability of model findings. Although the model used data from two clinical trials and a long-term follow up study, the total number of patients may not be sufficient to fully reflect the real-world sample. Also, heterogeneity in population characteristics (i.e., comorbidities, disease severity, demographics) may limit the generalizability. Third, the choice of the model comparator was limited due to a lack of evidence on direct comparisons and specific study protocols. Hence, the comparator arm was the placebo with therapy from MDMA-AT clinical trials instead of treatments from PTSD clinical practice. Fourth, the average observation of patients in the follow-up study was 17 months, while the model time horizon was 25 years. This study demonstrated that MDMA-AT was a more cost-effective treatment than placebo with therapy for patients with chronic moderate or higher severity PTSD. Inputs with the highest impact on model findings were quality of life benefits in treatment and comparator arms. The results were consistent with 5,000 simulations. Based on these findings, MDMA-AT is a novel option for patients with chronic PTSD that may decrease disease burden, including economic aspects, and improve patient outcomes after a single treatment course. All steps in conducting the research were supervised and critically reviewed by experts from Lykos Therapeutics.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Sinéad Carew and Lisa Pauline Mattackal (Reuters) -Wall Street's main indexes fell on Tuesday as investors booked profits from post-election gains and awaited U.S. inflation data due in the coming days. The three major indexes had rallied to record highs since the Nov. 5 U.S. election as investors bet on a boost to equities from President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tax cuts and the prospect of easier regulatory policies. But investor enthusiasm was dampened on Tuesday. European shares lost 2% as European Central Bank policymakers warned that increased tariffs from Trump would hamper global growth. Some of the stocks expected to perform well under Trump gave back gains. Shares in electric car maker Tesla were down close to 5% after rising nearly 40% since the election results. The small-cap Russell 2000 index fell 1.5% after closing at a three-year high on Monday. Russell Price, chief economist at Ameriprise Financial, said the decline in stocks overseas pressured U.S. stocks, along with profit-taking after the rally and ahead of inflation data. "When we opened up already experiencing some downside with the very strong run that we've had, investors tend to look to take some profits just in case stocks continue to slide," Price said. On investors' radar is Wednesday's consumer price inflation data, followed by producer prices inflation and retail sales data this week, that are expected to provide clues about the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy path going forward. The data presents a near-term risk to investments, said Price. "It very likely is contributing to a little bit of the downside that we're seeing today." At 2:31 p.m., the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 230.63 points, or 0.52%, to 44,062.50, the S&P 500 lost 6.20 points, or 0.10%, to 5,995.15 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 3.25 points, or 0.02%, to 19,295.51. Among the S&P 500's 11 major industry sectors, materials and utilities led declines with more than 1% losses while consumer staples was among the biggest gainers. Markets have already dialed back expectations for interest-rate reductions over the next year, given strong economic data and the possible inflationary impact of some Trump policies. Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said on Tuesday that the U.S. central bank is ready to respond if inflation pressures rise or the job market weakens. The blue-chip Dow was weighed down by declines in healthcare and financial stocks, including UnitedHealth and Goldman Sachs, both off around 1%. Biotech firm Novavax dropped 5.8% after cutting its annual revenue forecast due to lower-than-expected sales of its COVID-19 vaccine. Honeywell hit a record high and was last up 3% after activist investor Elliott Investment said it has built a stake worth more than $5 billion in the industrial conglomerate. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3.25-to-1 ratio on the New York Stock Exchange where there were 281 new highs and 91 new lows. On the Nasdaq, 1,350 stocks rose and 2,885 fell as declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.14-to-1 ratio. The S&P 500 posted 51 new 52-week highs and 15 new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 177 new highs and 109 new lows.

Title: AppLovin stands out in the latest round of quarterly earnings calls

Expires Friday: Save $200 on Programmatic Marketing Summit passes. Ends Nov. 15 Expires Friday: Save $200 on Programmatic Marketing Summit passes. Ends Nov. 15 In recent weeks, the ad tech sector’s publicly traded companies released their official earnings figures, offering insights into the industry’s critical underpinning developments. Yesterday (November 11), Zeta delivered its Q3 earnings call, noting that revenues soared 42% year over year to hit $268 million. It also increased its quarterly earnings guidance to $297 million (up $32 million), noting that its recent purchase of LiveIntent will help buoy earnings. Earlier during the period, the intuitive talisman of the sector, The Trade Desk, posted its (now expected) quarterly revenue increase – up 27% year on year to $628 million – during the period. Still, it was the performance of AppLovin during the three months to September 30 that (arguably) proved most notable in the latest raft of earnings. AppLovin’s overall Q3 revenue hit $1.2 billion, representing a 39% year-on-year increase, with the outfit additionally forecasting between $1.24 billion and $1.26 billion in Q4 revenue. As a result, AppLovin’s market capitalization soared in the days following its latest earnings call, with its stock price easily surpassing that of Trade Desk to near $100 billion, with executives there pouring cold water on speculation that it may be exploring inorganic growth. “We’ve got the largest mediation solution in the sector and our teams built maybe the most innovative advertising technology that the world’s yet seen,” cofounder, chairman, and CEO Adam Foroughi. “And we’re now scaling it out. And so, if you sort of just fast-forward over the quarters and the years from here, we’re going to be able to service tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands to millions of advertisers on our platform to access this audience that they had never accessed before.” However, AppLovin CFO Matt Stumpf moved to clarify its intention for “growing the organic [advertising] business” when asked about press speculation on potential mergers and acquisitions by analysts. He said, “We have no plans, right, to do any M&A at this point on the advertising side of the business.” Separately, The Trade Desk Jeff Green underlined how his company has positioned itself as an alternative to the industry’s walled gardens and its shrinking reliance on ad tech’s historic targeting, i.e., third-party cookies, by underlining CTV’s role in its revenues. “2024 has been a banner year for CTV, and we have further cemented our position as the first-choice platform to help leading brands as they continue to shift their budgets from linear TV and UGC into CTV,” he said, noting how video represented just below half of its overall revenues during the period. Meanwhile, Magnite posted overall Q3 revenue of $161 million, representing a 9% year-on-year increase, with further revenue guidance between $170 million and $175 million during Q4, with executives there eager to trumpet its CTV efforts and curation efforts. “For the quarter, our year-over-year growth rate and contribution ex-TAC from CTV accelerated to 23% from a 12% growth rate in Q2,” said Michael Barrett, CEO of Magnite, making a note of its partnerships with Disney, Netflix, Paramount, Rooku, and Warner Bros. Discovery. “There’s an ongoing industry shift toward curation on the sell side, and it’s being fueled in part by signal loss on the demand side, where data collection is becoming more restricted due to privacy changes in browsers and devices,” said Barrett, noting revenue from this part of its business “has grown over 100% year over year… the sell side, there’s no better home for curation than the SSP, where it’s easiest for premium publishers to lie with their peers to attract spend.” Elsewhere, Criteo’s leadership touted its partnership with Microsoft as evidence of how its bet on retail media will offset the declines in its traditional (cookie-based) ad retargeting business, which produced an overall quarterly revenue of $459 million, down 2% year over year. Similarly, LiveRamp was keen to trumpet how its data business saw a boost from Oracle’s exit from the ads business, with revenues coming in at $185 million during the period, a jump from $160 million 12 months earlier. Meanwhile, DoubleVerify saw revenues increase 18% to hit $196.6 million, although CEO Mark Zagorski noted some of the company’s (and broader sector’s) vulnerabilities to the whims of advertisers and dependence on the policy decisions of platforms such as Google and Meta. “Six large customers scale back on ad spend that had our most premium products attached to it. In addition, we saw ad dollars incrementally shift from open exchange programmatic to walled gardens, where our activation solutions aren’t yet available,” he told analysts, noting the company closed approximately 70% of the RFPs it acted upon after Oracle’s summer exit from the ad game. On November 12, DoubleVerify’s main rival, Integral Ad Science — itself the subject of multi-billion dollar takeover speculation — is set to issue its Q3 earnings the same day as PubMatic, which is duking it out with DSPs for more significant sway in the ad market (just like Magnite). Regardless of the numbers, analysts setting the valuations of such companies will likely pay more interest to the developments in the (almost over) Google ad tech trial coming November 25. This is when closing arguments from either side are scheduled to take place, the outcome of which could see Google’s sell-side offering broken up in a development that would fundamentally reshape the competitive landscape for each of the above companies. As the holiday shopping season kicks off, Digiday+ Research sat down with brand and retail marketers to see how they’ve prepared for the season. A record 53% of holiday shopping is expected on mobile this year, and brands are readying their sites and socials to meet the demand. CMOs and agency execs say brands need to listen to voter feedback to understand if they know what resonates with consumers.

Title: Tesla’s Meme Stock Soars To $1 Trillion Market Cap After Trump’s Win
URL: https://jalopnik.com/tesla-s-meme-stock-soars-to-1-trillion-market-cap-afte-1851694655

Good morning! It’s Monday, November 11, and this is The Morning Shift, your daily roundup of the top automotive headlines from around the world, in one place. Here are the important stories you need to know. Tesla’s market cap has surpassed $1 trillion following former President Donald Trump’s election victory on November 5. It rallied 29 percent following Tuesday’s result. That should put the “Is Tesla a meme stock” debate to rest once and for all, even if CEO Elon Musk is slated to play a huge part in Trump’s second administration. Following November 5's close, Tesla had a market cap of $807.1 billion. At the time of writing this story, that number is now $1.01 trillion. Before last week’s massive rally, shares of the carmaker were up about 1 percent on the year. That number is now 30 percent year to date. From CNBC: Tesla rejoins a growing club of tech names that are now worth more than $1 trillion, including Nvidia , Apple , Microsoft , Alphabet , Amazon and Meta (though all but Meta are worth more than $2 trillion). Tesla’s market cap first crossed the $1 trillion mark in October 2021. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives has said that a potential Trump administration could spell less regulation for Tesla and other companies. “Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry and this dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment, coupled by likely higher China tariffs that would continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players (BYD, Nio, etc.) from flooding the U.S. market over the coming years,” Ives wrote in a note to clients this week. Trump has said previously he may cut the federal $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit. Those credits have helped to drive sales of Tesla vehicles historically. Tesla posted revenue of $25.18 billion and a net income of $2.17 billion in the third quarter of 2024. During the earnings call, Musk said his “best guess” was that “vehicle growth” would hit 20 or 30 percent in 2025. He pointed to “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy” as driving forces behind his prediction. I guess we’ll see. Tesla has been promising, and developing, driverless vehicle technology for more than a decade. Its key U.S. competitor, Alphabet-owned Waymo, has pulled ahead and is already operating commercial robotaxi services in several major cities. On the third-quarter call, Musk said he would use his sway with a Trump-Vance administration to establish a “federal approval process for autonomous vehicles.” Currently, approvals happen at the state level, which the CEO sees as a regulatory hurdle Tesla will need to overcome once it finally offers more than partially automated driving systems. Whatever, man. They won. This shit sucks. Let them realize Elon is just making shit up on their own. Both electric vehicle startups Lucid and Rivian make some really good cars, but they’ve got a little bit of a cash burn problem. Both lost money on every car they delivered in the third quarter, which isn’t great. Rivian reported a $1.1 billion net loss in Q3 on $874 million in revenue after sales fell. Lucid’s sales actually improved in the quarter, but its net loss widened to $950 million on $200 million in revenue. From Automotive News: The EV makers are expected to burn through billions of dollars as they develop more affordable midsize crossovers for 2026 that will lower the entry price into the brands from around $70,000 with shipping for current models to around $50,000 for the crossovers that are still about two years from production. Analysts say Rivian and Lucid need to rein in costs if they are ever to become profitable. In addition, they warn that the reelection of former President Donald Trump on Nov. 5 could bring reduced support for electric-vehicle incentives that go to the automakers and to the consumers who buy their products. “We anticipate that the transition to electric vehicles in the U.S. will be hindered under Trump’s administration,” GlobalData said in a Nov. 6 research note. Trump’s regulatory changes “could lead to a 15-20 percent decrease in the market share of battery electric vehicles in the U.S. by 2030 compared to our base forecast.” Bank of America downgraded Rivian stock to a neutral rating from buy after the third-quarter earnings report, citing the potential loss of regulatory credits from EV sales under a Trump administration. EV makers can sell those credits to industry counterparts who don’t meet emissions standards. “We are making real meaningful progress in terms of lowering our bill of materials, lowering our cost structure,” said Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe on the third-quarter earnings call Nov. 7. “In a similar fashion, we’re also driving efficiency into how we’re running the plant. So the hours per unit that we build is coming down.” In a bit of good news, Rivian expects to achieve a gross profit in the fourth quarter of this year. That’ll partially come through the sale of regulatory credits for about $275 million, according to the company, but hey, every little bit helps. In the third quarter, Rivian’s gross loss per vehicle delivered rose to $39,130 compared with $30,648 in the year-earlier period, it said. Those numbers will improve in the fourth quarter as a result of Rivian’s cost-cutting programs for its R1T pickup and R1S crossover, Scaringe said on the earnings call. Rivian said it had cash and cash equivalents of $5.4 billion at the end of the quarter. It also has a $5 billion investment from Volkswagen Group as part of a joint venture that is expected to close before the end of the year, Scaringe said. Third-quarter deliveries for the Irvine, Calif., automaker fell 36 percent to 10,018 vehicles, and output dropped 19 percent to 13,157, the company said. Rivian is suffering from a parts shortage that started in the third quarter that has limited electric-motor production, it said. Lucid has its own world of issues to deal with as well. Lucid reported a 91 percent increase in third-quarter sales to a record 2,781 for its sole model, the Air sedan. The Newark, Calif., automaker’s production increased 16 percent to 1,805 vehicles. Similar to Rivian, Lucid is focused on cost cutting to improve its finances after raising $4 billion this year to support its loss-making operations. Those include the start of production of its first crossover, the Gravity, this year and the development of the midsize model that is scheduled for production in late 2026. Lucid vastly expanded its Casa Grande, Ariz., factory this year for production of the Gravity and brought more of its manufacturing in-house to reduce costs, CEO Peter Rawlinson said on the Nov. 7 conference call. [...] In its third-quarter earnings report, Lucid said cash and cash equivalents stood at $1.89 billion, compared with $1.35 billion in the preceding three-month period. In October, Lucid announced it was raising $1.75 billion more through a public offering and a private placement of shares. Luckily for both nascent automakers, they both say they’ve got enough financing to fund projects into 2026. That’s a really good thing, because Lucid and Rivian make some of the most compelling products on the market right now. Jaguar is set to unveil a new concept vehicle in Miami on December 2 that’ll give a glimpse of the first new model under JLR’s strategy to reposition the British brand as a luxury EV maker. It’s going to be shown the night before Miami’s Art Week kicks off. JLR says the first model to be launched on its new JEA Jaguar-specific electric platform will be a “four-door GT,” so I suppose we should look out of some sort of fast sedan. That’s good news, because Jaguar is very good at fast, good-looking sedans. The automaker also said it will be a “copy of nothing.” From Automotive News: Jaguar will now launch the model in late summer 2026, CEO Adrian Mardell said on an earnings call on Nov. 8. Last year JLR said the Jaguar EV would be launched in 2025. Mardell told journalists that the company was being cautious on timing as it monitored demand for electric cars. “BEV adoption is looking a little bit weaker and more inconsistent than would have been 12 months ago,” he said. The U.S. and the U.K. will be key markets for the car, Mardell added. The U.K. is one of the best-performing global EV markets, with a share growing to 18 percent in the 10 months to the end of October. Demand for electric cars in the U.S. has been thrown into uncertainty with the election of Donald Trump to the presidency. Trump has promised to roll back some EV incentive programs, although he counts Tesla CEO Elon Musk as an important ally. JLR is monitoring the uptake of EVs as it plans the timing of the second and possible third models on the JEA platform as well as those cars on the company’s new Electrified Modular Architecture, or EMA, platform for smaller Range Rover models. Whatever Jaguar is going to do in the future, it better be damn good. It’s one of those brands I’ve always loved, and it’s a goddamn shame to see it in the shape its in today. The gas-powered Cadillac XT4 has an official expiration date as GM says the compact crossover will end production in January of 2025 at the company’s Fairfax Assembly plant in Kansas. It coincides with the end of the Chevy Malibu’s production at the same plant. Don’t fret, Fairfax enthusiasts. GM is investing $391 million at the plant to make the new version of the Chevy Bolt in late 2025. From the Detroit News: “General Motors is confident in our strong ICE and EV portfolio and will lean into growth opportunities guided by customer demand,” GM spokesperson Kevin Kelly said in a statement. “There is no change to our previously announced $391 million investment and staffing plans at Fairfax Assembly. This facility will continue to play a critical role in GM’s future with the new Chevrolet Bolt EV. “ GM plans to bring a shift back to Fairfax in October 2025 ahead of the start of Bolt production, according to a plant memo sent to employees that was obtained by The Detroit News. The automaker is anticipating a return of the second production shift in the first quarter of 2026, according to that memo. GM will be temporarily laying off 686 United Auto Workers-represented employees when Malibu production ends and about 759 more in January when the XT4 ends, according to the memo. GM originally planned to end XT4 production in January and then resume it in mid-2025 but pulled back on those plans. Cadillac has three more EVs coming: the Escalade IQ, the Optiq SUV and the Vistiq three-row SUV. It already has Cadillac Lyriq SUV and the hand-built Celestiq, an ultra-luxury car. “Cadillac will offer our most comprehensive portfolio ever in 2025 with twelve models and a mix of ICE and EVs,” Kelly said. “The current lineup meets the need of almost every luxury customer with an offering in most major segments. In just over a year, Cadillac has introduced six new products which will help us maintain our momentum.” XT4 production started in the fall of 2018 for the 2019 model year. Through Q3 of 2024, Cadillac sold 15,688 of the little crossovers. That’s down 12 percent from last year. So long, little guy. At the 11th hour on the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918, World War I ends. At 5 a.m. that…

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks climbed on Monday led by a continuation of the 'Trump trade' in the roaring post-election rally rally as investors looked ahead to a fresh reading on inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the way higher, up 400 points, or about 1%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up 0.3%. Both indexes are coming off their best week of the year, capped by record highs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added about 0.3%. Markets on Veterans Day were building on all-time highs thanks in large part to expectations for lower corporate taxes and deregulation from President-elect Donald Trump. Spirits are also buoyant after the Federal Reserve's latest interest-rate cut, though doubts about the rally's staying power are starting to emerge. Wall Street is waiting for October consumer inflation data on Wednesday for pointers to the path of rates. Last week, Chair Jerome Powell stayed mum on the Fed's thinking in the face of Trump policies that could keep price pressures in play. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards One worry is that Trump's proposed tariffs could feed through into higher inflation, prompting the Fed to scale back on rate cuts. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said on Sunday that if there is an escalating "tit-for-tat" reaction by other countries, policymakers will "have to wait and see". Traders now see a 65% chance that the Fed lowers rates by another quarter percentage point in December, per the CME FedWatch Tool. A week ago, before the presidential election, the odds stood at almost 80%. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) soared to top $82,000 for the first time, amid high hopes for a crypto-friendly Trump administration and Congress. Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) and other smaller digital currencies also gained as traders bet on Trump's promise to make the US a leading light in crypto. In corporates, Tesla (TSLA) shares — another "Trump trade" hot spot — continued to climb, up over 8%. The EV maker's stock hit its highest close in over two years on Friday, topping $1 trillion in market value amid optimism over CEO Elon Musk's relationship with the incoming president. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Stocks on Veterans Day opened at all-time highs as market euphoria continued following the presidential elections and the Fed's latest rate cut last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the way higher, up roughly 0.6%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added about 0.3%. Two of the biggest "Trump trades" to watch on Monday were bitcoin (BTC-US) touching $82,000 to a new all-time high, and Tesla (TSLA) gaining for a fifth straight session. The EV maker's stock topped $1 trillion in market value on Friday. CEO Elon Musk was a major political supporter of Trump, helping him get elected. On Monday, Wedbush analysts raised their price target on Tesla's stock to a Wall Street high, while maintaining an Outperformance rating. "We are raising our price target on Tesla to $400 from $300 as we believe the Trump White House win will be a gamechanger for the autonomous and AI story for Tesla and Musk over the coming years," Wedbush managing direction Dan Ives wrote in a note. Today, on Veteran's Day, stock markets are open and pointing to further post-election gains, amid big moves in digital assets. Tesla (TSLA) shares surged more than 7% in premarket trading, fueled by optimism over CEO Elon Musk's support for President-elect Donald Trump. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) hit a new milestone, surpassing $82,000, as Trump’s pro-crypto stance and a Congress with more crypto-friendly lawmakers spark investor enthusiasm.

Title: Elon Musk’s Trump bet has paid off so well that Tesla is now worth more than most of the rest of the car industry combined

Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s ‘all-in’ gamble to get Donald Trump elected president has proven so successful that a veritable chasm has opened up between his EV manufacturer and the rest of the auto industry. As conventional carmakers trade at rock-bottom prices amid a broad industry malaise brought on by China’s economic slowdown and growing fears of Trump tariffs, Tesla’s stock continues to soar, creating one of the biggest valuation gaps it’s ever seen. On Friday, Tesla reclaimed its place in the elite club of companies worth more than $1 trillion after adding a full third in market capitalization since Election Day less than a week ago. The last time Tesla was worth this amount of money it was April 2022, Musk had just revealed his $44 billion plan to acquire Twitter. Relative to its peers, Tesla is now worth more than the next 15 largest carmakers combined—from Toyota and General Motors all the way down to Jeep’s parent company Stellantis and Hyundai. Toss in lower ranked names like Kia and Renault, respectively worth $26.6 billion and $12.6 billion, and Tesla is still is still ahead, only drawing even once the $8.8 billion from Japan’s Nissan is thrown into the mix. Pretty soon more names can be added to the list, as Tesla is indicated to open nearly 7% higher on Monday, raising its market cap to approximately $1.1 trillion. Last week’s gains also reflect market optimism that Trump will deliver on his planned cut to the corporate tax rate from 21% down to 15% for U.S. manufacturers like Tesla. Musk might even get his wish for federal legislation enabling autonomous vehicles, replacing the confusing patchwork quilt of state laws. This could accelerate Tesla’s plans to roll out unsupervised full-self driving. And while some economists fear Trump’s love for tariffs could hurt business with GM’s Chevrolet Equinox and Ford Mustang Mach-E—both EVs competing with Tesla—imported from Mexico, that is not likely to slow Tesla down. Musk manufactures all Tesla models sold in the U.S. either at its California plant in Fremont or in Austin (its battery cells, a major input by value, are however still predominantly imported from Asia). David Sacks, like Musk a member of the PayPal mafia who supported Trump, had a simpler explanation for why the stock soared after the election. Musk's influence in Trump’s second administration would defang regulatory enforcement by agencies like the traffic safety authority NHTSA and put a swift end to investigations into Musk’s business dealings. “That was the lawfare discount — the stock market pricing in the viciousness of Democrats,” Sacks posted on Friday. Tesla's stock premium compared to its peers is also cavernous. At present, Yahoo Finance lists Tesla’s likely 2025 earnings per share at $3.24, according to the consensus estimate of 34 analysts polled. That means investors are paying 100 times earnings for each share, versus 5.3 times for a General Motors. Generally a 100 earnings multiple is the point at which even tech stocks tends to lose the tether to their underlying fundamentals. Take Nvidia, for example: the stock that drove S&P 500 gains this year — it trades at 36.1 times next year’s forecast earnings. Other megacap trillion dollar companies like Amazon (33.9x) Microsoft (28.3x), Apple (27.3x), Meta (23.3x) and Alphabet (19.9x) currently are valued at multiples that are even lower. That could suggest that Tesla’s earnings estimates are lagging behind the market and have yet to catch up with investor sentiment. But 34 analysts just recently revised them upwards over the past 30 days, mainly to reflect Musk’s bullish October prediction that Tesla car sales are set to jump by 20% to 30% next year on the back of new models including lower priced versions of the Cybertruck. As a result, Future Fund money manager Gary Black warned the spread between Tesla’s sentiment-driven share price and the average Wall Street price target based on the fundamental business metrics has reached its highest level since October 2021—a month before the stock hit its all-time peak. “Absent earnings increases, analysts can’t just raise Tesla price targets without economic justification,” he argued on Monday. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: US to TSMC: Halt AI chip shipments to China

Good morning. Our spectacular Fortune Global Forum is finally upon us. There’s a great deal of tech on the program. Today’s sessions include talks about China, AI, entertainment, and workplace transformation with leaders from the biggest organizations on the planet. (And interviewers that include yours truly.) Unable to join IRL? That’s OK. Watch a mainstage livestream right here. —Andrew Nusca Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here. The United States has told one of the world’s largest chipmakers to quit sending advanced chips to Chinese customers. The Department of Commerce reportedly sent Taiwan’s TSMC a letter imposing export restrictions on certain advanced chip designs—7 nanometers and below—that are used in larger AI chips. Just weeks ago, TSMC notified the U.S. that its chips had somehow made their way into Huawei AI processors—a trade violation because the Shenzhen company is on a restricted trade list. The Biden administration reportedly drafted new rules on some exports of chipmaking equipment to Chinese companies, but they remain unreleased.According to Reuters, TSMC has notified its clients that it would suspend chip shipments starting today. —AN Bangalore’s hottest club? The $1.4 billion initial public offering by Swiggy. The food and grocery delivery company’s IPO is reportedly way oversubscribed thanks to a final rush of institutional investors. Retail investors were also oversubscribed. The offering, which is expected in Mumbai on Wednesday, promises to be India’s second-largest this year behind Hyundai Motor India. Swiggy, which principally competes with rival Zamato, isn’t yet profitable, and that will likely weigh on traders’ minds as the company makes its debut. (A recent investigation by India’s competition commission found both firms to be in violation of antitrust laws given their exclusivity contracts with partners.) In the meantime, the 10-year-old company is already well on its way in assessing new areas for expansion—e.g. ticketed events or personal services like fitness trainers—as it pursues a “superapp” approach. —AN Edtech pioneer Chegg—which offers textbook rental, online tutoring, study tools, and other student-focused services—is on its knees as students look to ChatGPT for help with their homework. Chegg’s share price is down 99%, to about $2, from early 2021, when it peaked at about $113. “Since ChatGPT’s launch,” a Wall Street Journal story reads, “Chegg has lost more than half a million subscribers who pay up to $19.95 a month for prewritten answers to textbook questions and on-demand help from experts.” Today Chegg has its own AI-powered tools, but they haven’t reversed subscriber decline. Wall Street expects the company to record a drop in revenue when it shares its third-quarter earnings tomorrow. Chegg has pivoted several times since its 2006 founding as an Iowa State University message board. (Chegg = chicken + egg. Get it?) It made its public debut on the New York Stock Exchange in late 2013. But it’s been a rough ride since the go-go days of the Covid-19 pandemic. Longtime CEO Dan Rosensweig stepped down in June; his successor, Nathan Schultz, promptly laid off more than 400 employees—a quarter of the company’s workforce. —AN Science-fiction fans, this one’s for you. (Privacy fans, maybe stop reading right here.) Visa and China’s Tencent are partnering to launch a new biometric service in Singapore that would require you to place your palm over a reader to authenticate and make payments at retail stores and restaurants. The service will be available to holders of Visa cards issued by Singaporean banks DBS, UOB, and OCBC. Tencent and Visa will first deploy the tech in the wild at Alchemist, a local coffee chain with 10 locations throughout the city-state. Here’s how it works. Completing a one-time enrollment at a merchant’s point of sale allows a Visa payment token to be bound to your palm biometric template. After that, simply wave your mitt to pay anywhere the tech is supported—no card or phone necessary. Why Singapore, you ask? Because its population is primed for tech. Close to seven in 10 people in the island nation believe using your palm is a secure way to pay, according to Visa. —AN In the wake of Apple’s admission that it may never invent something as popular and lucrative as the iPhone comes fresh analysis saying that its future lies in the planets that orbit around its star. (So to speak.) Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says Apple will likely realize future growth from new product categories that reinforce the constellation of services—its App Store, Apple Music, Apple TV+, and others—that emerged in the wake of its smash-hit smartphone. That will hardly come as a surprise to anyone who’s watched Apple over the last decade and a half. Apple’s iPad (born 2010), Watch (2015), HomePod (2018), and Vision (2024) were all meant to reinforce that ecosystem. Nevermind retroactive changes made to the Mac itself, which well predates Apple’s Golden iGoose. Gurman, a longtime Apple watcher, believes growth can be found in several product categories. A non-“Pro” Apple Vision could pack the company’s ecosystem into something that better resembles daily eyewear. The AirPod family could continue its growth (there are now four models) by integrating more advanced features. And, of course, there’s the living room. A sharper take on the HomePod family—perhaps something with a screen?—would help Apple better compete with devices from Amazon, Google, and Meta. —AN —Amazon is reconfiguring its physical stores to better align shopping, fulfillment needs. —Painting made by AI robot sells for $1.1m. It depicts Alan Turing as a god. —Daniel Lurie wasn’t tech leaders’ first choice for SF mayor, but they expect a good working relationship. —17% of peer reviews in CS pubs are AI-written. Commendable, as a chatbot might say. —A new Apple update forces idle phone reboots that reportedly keeps law enforcement at bay. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Internal Tesla salary database shows Elon Musk's strategy: Lower salaries, bigger stock grants

Tesla attracts millions of job seekers annually. The few who receive offers typically face a calculated gamble: Accept lower base pay up front for the chance of a potentially lucrative future payout. Business Insider secured access to an internal Tesla pay database, covering nearly 100,000 employees as of December 2021. That data, along with public filings and interviews with people who have worked for the automaker, reveal the company's pay strategy. Tesla offers lower base salaries than its tech and automotive peers but offers substantial stock grants. Even Tesla's top earners must bet on the company. This high-risk, high-reward system is coupled with a selective hiring process that has in the past included Elon Musk's sign-off for every hire. Using Tesla's internal salary database, BI looked at median base pay for the roughly 13,000 full-time, salaried, US-based employees across the internal job categories that Tesla uses to define workers in business units, such as engineering, manufacturing, or data management. (BI excluded pay for hourly workers, many of whom work in manufacturing, as it was not possible to accurately calculate their median annual pay based on hourly payroll data.) BI further broke down the data to look at median base pay by job title, analyzing the numbers for full-time, US-based, salaried roles with at least five employees. The base pay for these titles, which include directors of engineering and managers who work in Tesla's service centers fixing vehicles, ranges from about $35,000 to $324,000, according to the data. Nine current and former workers told BI the pay structure has largely remained in place since December 2021 and is ultimately part of Musk's quest to hire only the most "hardcore" workers. "The whole system is set up to find the fanatics," a current Tesla worker with knowledge of the company's hiring process said. "They could get better pay somewhere else, but we want the people who are die-hard Tesla." A former Tesla recruiter who worked with the company until 2024 said the automaker's interview process for engineers — which typically entails at least nine interviews and can take months — and the company's pay structure are designed to weed out workers who are looking to just "clock in and clock out." "It's a culture thing," the former recruiter said. "It's not even about how smart you are or how much you know. They're looking for a willingness to learn and put in the extra hours." Tesla, Musk, and the company's board of directors did not respond to requests for comment. In a December 2023 regulatory filing, Tesla reported it employed more than 140,000 people worldwide. In April, Tesla told staff it planned to cut more than 10% of its workforce. A June estimate from CNBC placed Tesla's headcount at just over 120,000. Using separate data from the Securities and Exchange Commission, BI compared the company's median base pay with that of traditional automakers and the six largest tech firms by market cap. Tesla lags behind all of them except Amazon. While there are a variety of factors that can affect a company's median salary — for example, Amazon's large warehouse workforce or Apple's large retail workforce — the data is consistent with what four current and former Tesla employees say: Tesla's base salaries are generally less than competitors'. Nvidia, Ford, Meta, and Amazon declined to comment on their employee compensation packages. Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet did not respond to a request for comment. GM said it has doubled its staff in Silicon Valley over the past six months and is competitive in hiring talent away from tech firms. Nine current and former people in engineering and sales said that Tesla's stock grants make it easier to accept lower base salaries. Tesla stock could make them rich, if only on paper. On November 8, the automaker's stock surged more 8% in the wake of Donald Trump's re-election, hitting a market cap of $1 trillion. Some Tesla employees can receive millions of dollars in stock. In 2020 and 2021, 44 US-based employees were offered stock worth more than $1 million, according to the database. To get a sense of which employees were more likely to take home large grants, BI broke up stock grants based on job category. The data show that most workers in engineering received stock grants above $25,000. The value of the stock is based on the value of the shares at the time they were granted, but it's subject to change based on Tesla's share price. Of the stock offerings at Tesla, about 75% were restricted stock units, or RSUs, while nonqualified stock options made up 21%, and were given exclusively as merit-based compensation, according to BI's analysis of US-based, full-time workers. Only 4% of employees — including many executives and other high-level workers — received the stock as incentive stock options, or ISOs. Zaheer Mohiuddin, the cofounder of Levels.fyi, said RSUs are very common in tech, while incentive stock options are typically reserved for longtime high-level employees or nonpublic companies. RSUs are typically included in standard compensation packages, while nonqualified stock options and ISOs are often used as additional incentives. RSUs give employees actual shares that vest over time, while ISOs simply provide the right to purchase stock at a preset price before expiration — which is potentially profitable if the stock price rises above that level, but also requires the employee to have money on hand to pay for the stock in the first place. Outside of one person within Tesla's executive job category who had no stock amount listed, Tesla executives received stock offerings worth between $950,000 and $20 million, according to the database, which displayed the latest stock amount for each employee as of December 2021. All but one of the executives' offerings were ISOs. Tesla is far from the first company to enhance base pay with stock grants. Companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon have been known to offer employees healthy stock grants. Employee survey data from 2024 from the compensation-benchmarking company Levels.fyi found that Tesla's median base pay and stock grants for US-based software engineers are slightly lower than that of US-based software engineers at Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet, collectively. Over the past five years, Tesla's stock has spiked well over 1,000%; that performance potentially makes those grants attractive. Greg Selker, a managing director at the executive recruitment firm Stanton Chase, told BI that while other Big Tech companies might have higher base pay and equity grants to match, Tesla's strength also lies in its image. "There's a mission-driven element to it that allows Tesla to get away with paying less," Selker said. "These people are working to bring about the decarbonization of the planet." Musk has previously described what the stock options can do for employees. "We give everyone stock options; we've made many people who are just working the line — who didn't even know what stocks were — we've made them millionaires," he said last year. BI examined the median stock grants and the percentage of employees who received grants for each job category and found that a majority of workers in nearly every category received some type of stock grant. Tesla's pay strategy has more in common with other Silicon Valley companies like Google or Meta than it does with traditional automakers, Harley Shaiken, an auto industry and labor expert, told BI. Traditional automakers like GM or Ford rely on higher base pay while companies like Tesla, which has seen higher stock returns over the past five years, can attract talent through stock grants, Shaiken said. "Tech workers are looking for the opportunity for a big payday, not just an incremental salary bump," he said. One former sales manager said Tesla's stock offerings initially attracted him to the role, but he compared them to "golden handcuffs." "The stock is the major hook. You might be unhappy in your role, but you just decide, 'I'm going to keep my head down and wait a few months longer until I vest,'" he said. Tesla's stock offerings have given some workers opportunities for major paydays. Drew Baglino, Tesla's former senior vice president of powertrain and energy engineering, and Zachary Kirkhorn, the former CFO, were awarded $20 million each. Other executives, including Musk's right-hand man Omead Afshar, received $10 million in stock offerings, according to the database. "It's part of the benefit of taking a chance on a company like Tesla," one engineer who joined the company in 2015 told BI. "You might have to deal with the aches and pains of a startup — the long hours, some of the uncertainty — but there can also be a significant payoff." Aaron Greenspan, a vocal critic of Musk and the founder of PlainSite, an organization that provides access to legal documents and advocates for legal transparency, first referenced Afshar's stock grant in a lawsuit filed against defendants including Musk and Tesla, accusing them of defamation, among other claims. Lawyers for Musk and Tesla have called his claims "largely unintelligible allegations." The lawsuit is ongoing. Tesla awards stock grants with promotions and annual reviews and bases them on the company's performance, according to the salary database and conversations with four current employees. Last year, the company cut back on merit-based stock awards for staff, Bloomberg reported and the four employees told BI. In June, Musk told staff he planned to award additional stock grants for "exceptional performance." During annual performance reviews in July, managers were limited to recommending no more than 20% of their team to be considered for the extra award, two people with knowledge said. Tesla typically awards employees restricted stock units that vest over a period of four years, the data show. Selker said historically Tesla workers have been able to count on their stock continuing to grow. "It's a bet they have to make," he said. So far, stock grants have "proven to be better than cash in your pocket." "Now, if the stock were to become inconsistent or halve, then Tesla will have to change its strategy," he added. Tesla's stock has experienced significant volatility this year, slumping as low as 44% in mid-April from its price at the start of the year. Following Donald Trump's re-election, it's up nearly 30% overall year to date. At least one longtime Tesla staffer worries about new hires. "I feel lucky that I got in early, but I see a lot of younger engineers expecting to reap the same benefits," they said. "And I'm not sure they will." Do you work for Tesla or have a tip?

Title: Inflation and retail sales data greet a roaring stock market rally: What to know this week

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks just had their best week of 2024. All three major indexes pressed to record highs after Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election. For the week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 4.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose nearly 6%. In the week ahead, a fresh reading on inflation and retail sales will lead the economic calendar. In corporate news, quarterly results from Home Depot (HD), Cisco (CSCO), and Disney (DIS) will highlight another week of earnings reports. In a widely anticipated move, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points last Thursday. In a press conference following the announcement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell declined to comment on the central bank's plans for future rate cuts. "We don’t think it’s a good time to be doing a lot of forward guidance," Powell said. He later noted that Fed officials will need to gauge the economic data released between now and December before knowing if the central bank will cut interest rates again this year. The first data the Fed will consider ahead of its next meeting will come out on Wednesday with the release of the October Consumer Price Index (CPI). Wall Street economists expect headline inflation rose just 2.6% annually in October, an increase from the 2.4% rise in September. Prices are set to rise 0.2% on a month-over-month basis, per economist projections, in line with the increase seen in September. On a "core" basis, which strips out food and energy prices, CPI is forecast to have risen 3.3% over last year in October, unchanged from September's increase. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.3%, also in line with the September gain. "The October CPI report will likely support the notion that the last mile of inflation's journey back to target will be the hardest," Wells Fargo's economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note to clients on Friday. The final monthly retail sales report before the start of the holiday shopping season is set for release on Thursday. Economists estimate retail sales increased 0.3% over the prior month during October. The control group of retail sales — which excludes several volatile categories like gasoline and feeds directly into gross domestic product (GDP) — is also expected to have risen by 0.3%. Entering the release, several trackers point to the fourth quarter being off to a solid start for economic growth. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow tracker currently projects the US economy growing at 2.5%. Disney is set to report quarterly results before the bell on Thursday as the media giant looks to continue to improve its streaming business amid further declines in linear television. Investors will also be focused on results within the company's theme park business after the segment fell short in its most recent quarter. Streaming profitability should be a bright spot after the company reported its first quarter of profits for that business in August. The segment should get a boost from recent price hikes along with the continued rollout of Disney's password-sharing crackdown across its various platforms. Shares are up about 9% this year. In a roaring rally over the final three trading sessions of the week, much has been made about trades like financials that could benefit from President-elect Donald Trump's policy. Big Tech also saw significant upside. Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) — which tracks Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — hit a fresh record highs on both Thursday and Friday. Three of the Magnificent Seven stocks, Tesla, Nvidia, and Amazon, outpaced the S&P 500 on the week, with Alphabet also coming close. Tesla had a unique Trump-related catalyst, with investors banking on CEO Elon Musk's big bet on the president-elect's campaign paying off. Broadly, markets seemed to be pricing in the potential for less government regulation over Big Tech in a second Trump term. Perhaps indicative of the tech industry's high hopes, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai all rushed to congratulate Trump on his victory. The week's stock moves also coincided with a surge in Treasury yields, with the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) nearly hitting 4.5%. Strategists have often cited a "flight to quality" environment when yields rise, where money flows to large corporations with solid earnings growth and healthy balance sheets. Big Tech fits this mold and saw a rally when yields rose back in the spring. Small caps were one of the beneficiaries of the post-Trump election rally. The Russell 2000 (^RUT) small-cap index jumped more than 5% on Wednesday for its best day in nearly two years. It closed the week up more than 8% for its best week since April 2020 and is now closing in on its all-time high. This leaves investors with a question that's been prompted throughout 2024: With the Fed set to keep lowering interest rates, is now the time to pile into small caps? In a Friday webinar, Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz said not yet. The index has more short-term debt than the S&P 500 and would be a clear beneficiary of lower interest rates. But it also has another key difference from large-cap indexes right now: Earnings estimates aren't rising. While Kantrowitz's research shows 2024 full-year earnings estimates for the S&P 500 have increased over the last 90 days, earnings estimates for the small-cap S&P 600 (^SP600) index have been falling. "In the last 20 days ... we've definitely seen small cap estimates at the margin move pretty sharply lower," Kantrowitz said. He added that investors would want to see earnings accelerating to signal the start of a recovery. "[It's] not something we're seeing quite yet," Kantrowitz said. "So something we'll be monitoring." Economic data: No notable economic releases.

Full Content:
UPDATED 06:33 EST / NOVEMBER 10 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us.

Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis.

Title: Elon Musk's wealth soars past $300 billion as Tesla shares climb on the back of Trump's election win

Elon Musk's net worth has surged past $300 billion as Tesla shares climbed following Trump's election win earlier this week. Musk's fortune stands at $314 billion as of Saturday, up a handsome $50 billion since November 5, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That makes Musk the only person with a current net worth of more than $300 billion — Amazon founder Jeff Bezos trails behind in second with $230 billion, while Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg rounds out the top three with $209 billion, per Bloomberg. The Tesla CEO's soaring wealth — which is shy of his record of around $340 billion in 2021 — follows a bumper week in the stock market for the company, which has seen its shares jump around 28% since Tuesday's close. The EV maker on Friday reached a trillion-dollar market valuation for the first time since April 2022. Musk was a big supporter of Trump during the latter's presidential campaign, putting over $100 million of his own money into a super PAC and holding his own rallies to try to get him elected. And it looks like that might be about to pay off for Musk. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note this week that Trump's win could significantly benefit Tesla, as the company is better positioned than competitors should Trump withdraw tax credits and other incentives meant to boost EV sales when he's back in office. "Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry and this dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment, coupled by likely higher China tariffs that would continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players (BYD, Nio, etc.) from flooding the US market over the coming years," he said. Ives called Trump's victory a "homerun" for the company. Musk's other ventures, such as his aerospace company SpaceX, could also benefit during Trump's second term in office. Francesco Trebbi, a professor of business and public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, previously told BI that a Trump presidency might help the company procure large contracts with the Department of Defense.

Tesla shares spiked in the wake of Donald Trump’s election win this week–and so did a handful of other stocks, in industries ranging from crypto to coffee. Elon Musk is worth more than $300 billion for the first time in more than two years. It was a giddy week for U.S. stocks. Markets jumped in the wake of Donald Trump’s presidential election win early Wednesday, briefly sending the S&P 500 over 6,000 for the first time ever on Friday. The Nasdaq index rose 5.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed nearly as much. No billionaire’s fortune grew more in dollar terms than that of Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and principal owner of social media firm X. Tesla shares rose nearly 30% in the past week, increasing the company’s market value to more than $1 trillion, adding $41 billion to Musk’s net worth and lifting him above the $300 billion mark for the first time in two years. Musk ended Friday worth $304 billion, Forbes estimates. In addition to a runup in the price of Bitcoin–as of late Friday afternoon it was trading at $76,550, just off its all-time high–shares of crypto exchange Coinbase Global and crypto-friendly stock trading app Robinhood shined this week. Coinbase shares rocketed up 48% this week, boosting the fortunes of cofounders Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam, while Robinhood shares shot up 27%, lifting the net worths of cofounders Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt. Big tech stocks ticked up as well. Oracle chairman Larry Ellison got nearly $24 billion richer this week as shares of the software and cloud computing company he cofounded rose 11%. Amazon chairman Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckeberg got $9 billion and about $7.5 billion richer, respectively, as shares of both their companies moved higher. It’s not just election enthusiasm driving up share prices. A few companies that reported strong quarterly earnings in the second half of the week had enormous runups. Nasdaq-listed AppLovin, which makes tools that help developers grow their apps, reported better-than-expected third quarter revenue and Ebitda late Wednesday, leading shares to jump on Thursday and continue rising Friday–a 77% rise for the week. That boosted CEO and cofounder Adam Foroughi’s fortune by some $3.8 billion to $8.7 billion. Doximity, a social network for doctors, had a “blowout quarter” per a report from analysts at Canaccord Genuity. Shares of the Nasdaq-listed company rocketed up nearly 38% this week, adding nearly $900 million to cofounder and CEO Jeff Tangney’s fortune. Coffee drink chain Dutch Bros also had reason to cheer. Shares of the Oregon-based company got a 41% boost this week. The company projects higher revenue for the year. Billionaire CEO Travis Boersma’s fortune got a $900 million lift. Here are some of the biggest billionaire gainers of the past week. (Net worths are as of market close Friday, November 8. Change is measured from market close on Friday, November 1.) Elon Musk Net worth: $304 billion Gain: $41 billion Musk, who formerly supported Democrats, donated nearly $119 million to a super PAC supporting Trump, showed up at Trump rallies and has vowed to cut $2 trillion from the U.S. budget as an advisor to the new president. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients after the election results came out that Tesla has several potential avenues from which it would benefit under Trump’s leadership, including a possible elimination of a federal tax credit on electric vehicles, which would make it harder for Tesla’s smaller competitors. Larry Ellison Net worth: $230.7 billion Gain: $23.7 billion Software and cloud computing firm Oracle, which Ellison cofounded and chairs, got a boost along with other big tech stocks in the wake of Trump’s win. Shares scooted up 11% for the week. Brian Armstrong Net worth: $11.7 billion Gain: $3.7 billion Fred Ehrsam Net worth: $3.3 billion Gain: $700 million Armstrong, who is CEO and chairman of crypto exchange Coinbase Global, cofounded the firm with Ehrsam, now a board member. Expectations of a crypto-welcoming Trump administration drove shares up markedly on Wednesday, November 6–a rally that extended on Thursday and Friday, as Bitcoin hit a new high, climbing just past $76,000. Vlad Tenev Net worth: $1.9 billion Gain: $400 million Baiju Bhatt Net worth: $2 billion Gain: $400 million Robinhood Networks, the pro-crypto trading app founded by Tenev and Bhatt, also rode the Bitcoin wave higher, with shares climbing 27% this past week. Tenev serves as CEO of the company; Bhatt stepped down from an executive role at Robinhood in March and has since founded a startup that plans to set up solar panels in space that will beam renewable energy back to earth. Jeff Tangney Net worth: $3.2 billion Gain: $900 million Doximity, the social network for doctors that Tangney cofounded and runs as CEO, reported better than expected quarterly earnings on Thursday after the market closed. That sent shares soaring 35% on Friday. Tangney, who owns around 32% of the listed company, which had $475 million in revenues in its most recent fiscal year and as of late Friday sported a market capitalization of $10.8 billion. Adam Foroughi Net worth: $8.7 billion Gain: $3.8 billion Tech firm AppLovin, under CEO and cofounder Foroughi, impressed shareholders with stronger-than-expected revenues and EBITDA for the third quarter. Shares gushed up by a stunning 77% and added nearly $4 billion to Foroughi’s net worth. The company, which has trailing 12-month revenues of $4.3 billion, now sports a $97 billion market valuation. Travis Boersma Net worth: $3.1 b Gain: $900 million Coffee chain Dutch Bros perked up investors when it announced higher expectations of full year revenue for 2024–of between $1.255 billion and $1.26 billion. Quarterly revenue also rose 28% for the chain. That news sent shares up 41% for the week, and boosted cofounder and chairman Boersma’s fortune as well.

Title: Tesla Hits $1 Trillion Market Cap—Musk Becomes $300 Billion Man After Trump Win

Friends Read Free Shares of Tesla Motors rallied 9 percent to end the trading week, pushing the company’s value to $1 trillion for the first time since April 2022. The electric vehicle (EV) maker’s stock reached $325 on the Nasdaq Composite Index during the Nov. 8 trading session. Before Election Day, Tesla maintained a market cap of about $807 billion, and shares were up just 1 percent for the year. The company rejoins the growing club of trillion-dollar companies, including Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia. Tesla first ventured past the $1 trillion threshold in October 2021. Because of the stock’s significant gains, Elon Musk’s net worth surged to $300 billion for the first time in more than two years. Tesla’s stock rocketed by 33 percent this week, adding about $200 billion in value as investors cheered President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election. Since billionaire Elon Musk was a critical ally for Trump during the 2024 campaign, traders are betting that a second term for the Republican could benefit the automaker. Musk’s pro-Trump America PAC received about $118 million from the billionaire. Musk appeared alongside the president-elect at several rallies in the final days of the presidential election, hosted a tour across the key battleground state of Pennsylvania, and was at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate on election night. Trump has provided mixed views on electric automobiles. “I’m for electric cars. I have to be because Elon endorsed me very strongly,” Trump told a crowd of supporters in August at a rally in Atlanta. Trump later revealed that he may consider ending a $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases. In March, Trump stated that the U.S. automotive industry could suffer a “bloodbath” partly because of the current administration’s green energy policies. President Joe Biden’s administration has introduced EV incentives and EV-related grants to accelerate the transition from gas-powered automobiles to new energy vehicles. Still, Tesla could benefit under a Trump administration and provide the company with a competitive advantage, according to Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. “Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry, and this dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment, coupled with likely higher China tariffs that would continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players,” Ives said in a note. Seth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar Research, said that any changes to EV subsidies could affect domestic sales of electric cars. The stock has trended upward in the second half following a lackluster first half. Shares soared last month after the company’s upbeat third-quarter earnings report. Tesla topped Wall Street forecasts in the third quarter and registered better-than-expected profits. In the earnings call, Musk said that his “best guess” is that vehicle growth will reach 20 to 30 percent in 2025 amid “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.” Musk also said that he would help speed up the federal approval process for autonomous vehicles. Bank of America raised its target to “Buy” and forecasts a 17-percent upside to $350 from the previous estimate of $265. The first half of 2024, Goldstein said, was “likely the bottom” for the company. “In our view, the results signal that the first half of 2024 was likely the bottom for Tesla’s automotive gross profits, as we expect fourth-quarter results will also exceed 20 [percent],” Goldstein said in an Oct. 24 note.

Title: Donald Trump won the election. What happens to Trump Media now?

When Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT-3.61%) debuted on the Nasdaq (NDAQ+1.10%) in late March, Donald Trump had long since announced plans to launch his third bid for the White House. His election win now begs the question: What will happen to the company that counts the now president-elect as its biggest shareholder? Trump helped found Trump Media in 2021 with the launch his own social media platform, Truth Social, after being banned from X (META+0.07%) (formerly Twitter) in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. X owner and staunch Trump ally Elon Musk reinstated Trump’s X account in November 2022, one month after buying the platform. Trump Media went public on March 26 under the ticker DJT, after completing its merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC) (DWAC), a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. Now that Trump will be returning to the White House in January, his more than 100 million shares are a focal point. In a post on Truth Social Friday, Trump said that rumors allegedly coming from “market manipulators or short sellers” suggesting that he’s considering selling his stake in the company are “fake, untrue, and probably illegal.” “Truth is an important part of our historic win, and I deeply believe in it,” he said. Although he stands to gain from a sale, it would be difficult to carry out without tanking the value of the stock. Earlier this year, Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes repeatedly called on Congress to investigate manipulation and illegal short-selling of DJT stock. From an ethics standpoint, it’s a little muddy. While Trump, who is the primary shareholder of Trump Media with a 57.6% stake in the company, can legally hold onto his shares while in office, there is a conflict of interest. As president, Trump has direct oversight of government agencies that oversee the company, including the Federal Communications Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. “It’s a clear conflict of interest for the president of the United States to perform those executive functions while owning a substantial stake in a media company, whether it’s social media or any other,” Richard Painter, a former chief White House ethics lawyer, told Straight Arrow News. In practice, however, vice president of research at Morningstar (MORN-0.36%) John Rekenthaler said in an interview that he doesn’t think it will be an issue. “I don’t think with his presidency that voters or federal, national legislators will pursue that,” he said. The symbiotic relationship between Trump and Trump Media raises red flags for investors. The company itself has acknowledged in regulatory filings that its success depends in part on Trump’s popularity and reputation. In the six weeks leading up to Election Day, “pre-election euphoria” drove the stock nearly 200% higher as Trump’s odds of winning increased. Even before the election, DJT was what Rekenthaler calls an “affinity stock,” trading on emotions and fanaticism for the president elect rather than on actual business performance. The company reported yet another quarterly loss in its third-quarter earnings on Tuesday — also Election Day. In the three months ended Sept. 30, Trump Media lost $19.2 million, with revenue falling 5.6% to just $1.01 million from a year earlier. Given his outsized stake in the company, DJT stock performance also drives much of Trump’s own wealth. As of Friday, the company had a market capitalization of $6.53 billion. At a price per share of around $32, Trump’s net worth stemming from his holdings in the company is in the ballpark of almost $4 billion. Shares have been especially volatile around the election, with the stock closing down nearly 23% Thursday before popping back up 18% in Friday afternoon trading. Rekenthaler said that it’s possible the pre-election rally was an election trade, rather than a long-term investment. That might explain some of the volatility in recent days, particularly the losses on the day after Trump’s election victory. “There is the adage that you sell on the good news,” Rekenthaler said. “Maybe some people sold on the good news after the election.” When it comes to what the stock will do once Trump returns to the Oval Office, it’s anybody’s guess, according to Rekenthaler. “No idea,” he said. “To the extent that I had an idea, that idea disappeared the day after the election.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Tesla’s (TSLA+0.29%) market capitalization hit $1 trillion Friday morning, as Donald Trump’s election win has helped the EV maker’s stock surge this week. The company’s share price rose more than 6% to about $313 during intraday trading on Friday. It marks the first time Tesla stock has risen above $300 per share since September 2022. The EV giant is now the ninth largest company in the world by market cap. Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s alliance with Trump appears to be paying off, potentially giving Tesla a significant advantage under the new administration — including some influence on the regulation of driverless vehicles, while at the same time putting its competitors at a disadvantage. This includes possible influence over regulations covering self-driving vehicles. Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, highlighted that Tesla stock surged 44% over the past 12 trading days, far outpacing the Nasdaq’s 4% gain during the same period. “This is more than just a meme stock,” Munster wrote in a post Friday on X, the social media company owned by Musk. “The accelerating delivery growth next year (flat-ish in 2024 and up +20% in 2025) and the long-term opportunity around autonomy will power the fundamentals that should lead to further price appreciation.” In a post earlier this week, Munster wrote that Tesla’s surge in recent days is broadly “based on emotion, that emotion is Elon made a big bet and was right. This gives investors confidence that his next big bet has a greater potential to succeed. His next big bet is autonomy.” Musk has become a close ally of Trump’s over the past several months, even spending election night with him at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Earlier this year, Musk founded and donated at least $80 million to a super PAC that supported Trump’s campaign. And Musk, who also leads several other firms including SpaceX, is now poised to have some level of role or influence in the upcoming Trump administration. Musk has agreed to lead what he and Trump call a Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a commission that would conduct a “complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government” and recommend reforms. Musk has said he would cut “at least” $2 trillion from federal spending, which is likely a difficult task given that the federal government has spent $6.75 trillion in fiscal year 2024. As part of that job, Musk said he would advocate for a national approach to regulating driverless vehicles — a key market for Tesla — and cut overregulation, which he has repeatedly criticized as holding his companies back. SpaceX, Neuralink, X (META+0.07%), and Tesla are collectively the subject of at least 20 recent investigations or reviews. But whatever his exact role might be in the administration remains unclear. Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, who is helping lead Trump’s transition team, said before Election Day that Musk would work “adjacent” to the government and be “writing software” to help the government cut back spending. That would likely allow Musk to continue leading his companies without divesting, as he would have to do if he took an official role. While Trump’s victory is good for Tesla, it’s expected to be less friendly to other automakers with EV plans. He’s expected to freeze provisions of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which provided $7,500 tax credits for American-made EVs. Musk has supported ending the tax credit, believing it would help Tesla sales while slamming rivals. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Tesla returned to the $1 trillion club Friday, after its stock surged in the days following Donald Trump's presidential election victory. Shares in the electric automaker have soared approximately 23% since Wednesday — a sharp turnaround from a year in which its stock price had otherwise been moving sideways. The new valuation also increases Tesla CEO Elon Musk's net worth to some $300 billion, according to Forbes — increasing his net worth as the world's richest person by more than $30 billion. Musk campaigned aggressively for Trump, who has signaled he intends to appoint the Tesla chief to a role tasked with increasing government "efficiency" that would cut programs deemed wasteful. Through his rocket company SpaceX, Musk has been the beneficiary of billions in government contracts over the past decade. While Tesla has fewer direct contracts, it has been embroiled in multiple federal investigations and regulatory actions that could be dialed back once Trump takes office. Tesla's 13-figure valuation puts it among the ranks of Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Google-parent Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook-parent Meta. Tesla previously hit $1 trillion in 2021. Demand for Tesla's electric vehicles has shown some signs of weakness in recent quarters, but Musk has said he is staking the automaker's future not on environmentally conscious drivers but rather on a future fleet of autonomous vehicles. On that front, the company now faces competition from Alphabet-owned Waymo, which has already been steadily rolling out "robotaxi" services in several markets.

Title: Examining the e-cigarette scenario based on distribution, availability, marketing, and banning: A GIS-Based qualitative study in Bangladesh

Globally, over 81 million people use e-cigarettes, and the majority of them are young adults. Using e-cigarettes causes different types of adverse health effects both in adults and elderly people. Over time, using e-cigarettes has detrimental consequences on lung function, brain development and numerous other illnesses. This study employed a mixed-methods conducted between June and September 2023, comprising two phases: Geographical Information System (GIS) mapping of available e-cigarette point-of-sale (POS) locations and conducting 15 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with e-cigarette retailers, along with 5 key informant interviews (KIIs) involving tobacco control activists and policy experts. ArcGIS was employed for spatial analysis, creating distribution and type maps, and buffer and multi-buffer ring analyses were conducted to assess proximity to hospitals and academic institutions. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics for GIS mapping and qualitative analysis for interview transcripts, utilizing a priori codebook and thematic analysis. A total of 276 POS were mapped in the entire Dhaka city. About 55 POS were found within 100m distance from academic institutions in Dhaka city, which offers the easy accessibility of young generations to e-cigarettes. The younger generation is becoming the major target for e-cigarettes because of their alluring flavors, appealing looks, and variation in flavors. Sellers have been using different marketing tactics such as postering, offering discounts and using internet marketing on social media. Moreover, they try to convince the customers by saying that e-cigarettes are ‘not harmful’ or ‘less harmful’. However, retailers were mostly taking e-cigarettes from local wholesalers or distributors. Customers buy these products both from in-store and online services. Due to the absence of laws and regulations on e-cigarettes in Bangladesh, the availability, marketing, and selling of e-cigarettes are increasing alarmingly. E-cigarette retail shops are mostly surrounded by academic institutions, and it is expanding. Besides, frequent exposure, easy accessibility, and tactful promotion encourage the younger generations to consume e-cigarettes. The government should take necessary control measures on manufacturing, storage, advertising, promotion, sponsorship, marketing, distribution, sale, import, and export in order to safeguard the health and safety of young and future generations.

These battery-powered devices operate by heating a mixture of propylene glycol, glycerin, and water with a variety of flavors [2]. From 2011 to 2018, there was a significant increase in the number of e-cigarette users, rising from approximately 7 million to 41 million. This shift made a great impact on consumption pattern and brought about a new era of tobacco consumption [3]. However, despite becoming increasingly popular, e-cigarettes pose serious threats to public health. Initially hailed as safer alternatives to conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes introduce a novel source of nicotine, a highly addictive substance with so many adverse health effects [4–6]. Additionally, the World Health Organization has reported that e-cigarettes are harmful to health [7]. The heated liquid in the e-cigarette produces an aerosol of small particles that are absorbed by the lungs, quickly passing through the heart, and providing nicotine to the brain [8]. Even the regular use of e-cigarettes has been associated with deaths [9]. Notably, most e-cigarette users are former smokers or dual users, consuming traditional tobacco products, while a smaller group of people who have never smoked [10]. Although e-cigarettes have become increasingly popular among youth and young adults, but its consumption remained low among older adults. The jobless and manual laborers have the highest prevalence of e-cigarette usage, and men are more likely than women to use them [11]. It has found that about 700,000 middle and high school students are vaping every single day [12].Several research papers have depicted the reason why people are more likely to consume e-cigarettes. According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),teens who vape may become addicted to nicotine faster than teens who smoke cigarettes, leading to increased vaping frequency and duration, putting them at risk for nicotine addiction [13]. As a result, most of the customers (91%) reported enjoying vaping more than smoking, with 80% preferring non-tobacco e-cigarette flavors. In total, there were nearly 270 different e-cigarette brands available as of December 2022, an increase of 46.2% from January 2020 [14]. A more recent analysis found that these brands offer over 9,000 different devices, which has tripled since 2020 [15]. Researchers also identified more than 15,500 unique e-cigarette flavors available online in 2007 [16]. Among youth users of flavored e-cigarettes, the most commonly used flavor types were fruit (69.1%), candy/desserts/other sweets (38.3%), mint (29.4%) and menthol (26.6%) [12]. An experimental study found that adolescents who were exposed to displays predominantly comprising tobacco products were more willing to use e-cigarettes in the future, compared with those were not exposed to the displays [17]. Moreover, the effects of both e-cigarette retail display visibility, and the availability (both relative and absolute) of products such as food and alcohol and, by extension their visibility, is one of the key factor to change behaviors [18, 19]. According to a another study, the convincing pitches in advertisements greatly influence customer reactions to e-cigarette marketing and their behaviors and actions [20]. E-cigarette advertisements differ from traditional cigarette ads because they often portray their products as healthier alternatives to cigarettes, which can be used as solutions to help people quit smoking [20–23]. A review of various research articles shows that young people in developed countries like Europe and America are more attracted towards online exposure to e-cigarette retail displays on [24, 25]. According to a study, More than 40% of online e-cigarette vendors use loyalty programs, special discounts, and promotional coupons to attract new clients [26]. They also frequently utilize social media to distribute promotional deals, with an average of 2.6 different social media platforms used per seller website [26]. In the U.S., a large proportion of e-cigarettes in the market are imported, with nearly 100% coming from China between 2016 and 2018 [27]. In Australia, there are two possible ways to obtain an e-cigarette: the first is through a pharmacy, and the second is by using the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) personal importation system to import up to three months’ worth of stock [28]. The legal status of e-cigarettes is currently pending in many countries [29]. Many countries such as Brazil, Singapore, Uruguay [30] and India have banned e-cigarettes [31]. The US Food and Drug Administration has issued some regulations for e-cigarettes, including supervision, a minimum buying age of 18 years, premarket approval applications, warning signs, and displaying the list of harmful ingredients [32]. The Government of Bangladesh (GoB) has now banned conventional smoking in specific public places and on public transport. There are also implemented some regulations for packaging and advertising of these tobacco products [33]. This law significantly reduces the prevalence of smoking and tobacco use among the population. In contrast, there has no laws and regulations regarding the prohibition of the use, selling, promotion, or advertising of e-cigarettes in Bangladesh [34, 35]. To achieve good health and wellbeing (SDG goal 3), we have to strengthen the effort on Tobacco Control by 2030 [36]. Bangladesh government has targeted to achieve tobacco free Bangladesh by 2040. As a developing country, However, Bangladesh currently lack of evidence regarding distribution, marketing, and policy initiatives of e-cigarettes. Additionally, the regulation of e-cigarettes in Dhaka and Bangladesh remains relatively underdeveloped, emphasizing a critical gap in the country’s approach to tobacco control. Thus, this study helps to bridge these gaps by exploring the perception, distribution, availability, planning and banning scenario of e-cigarettes in the retail market of Dhaka, the center of Bangladesh. The aim of this study to provide scientific evidence that can inform future regulatory efforts and enforcing law. This was a qualitative study conducted between June and September 2023. Moreover, this study has been divided into two phases regarding data collection. The first phase generated data concerning Geographical Information System (GIS) mapping of the point of sale (POS) of e-cigarettes, and the second phase included in-depth interviews (IDIs) with e-cigarette retailers as well as key informant interviews (KIIs) with anti-tobacco activists and policymakers at both Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) and Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) in Bangladesh, which is also one of the world’s largest and most densely populated cities [37]. In this study, the participants for in-depth interviews (IDIs) were such as e-cigarette vendors who were directly or indirectly involved in e-cigarette distribution, and the participants for the key informant interview (KII) were such as anti-tobacco activists of Dhaka city. Most of the literature advises measuring purposeful sample sizes inductively and keeping sampling until saturation. A total of 20 people were invited to participate in the interview including fifteen participants for IDI and five anti-tobacco activists for KII. However, we got our saturation level before finishing the 20 interviews. The inclusion criteria of the participants were being Bangladeshi citizens and residents, handling e-cigarettes, and ability to talk. On the contrary, the exclusion criteria were including not living in Bangladesh, being a resident without Bangladeshi, do not handling e-cigarette, not willing to participate in the study. Before each of the interviews, the participants were informed about the aim and objectives of the study, if they gave permission then interviews were conducted by the moderators. This study used purposive sampling techniques to the interviewees. The current study purposefully collected data from various participant settings (e.g., street e-cigarette shops, residential e-cigarette shops, hybrid e-cigarette shops, dedicated e-cigarette shops etc.) to ensure the strength of the data. For GIS mapping, all e-cigarette outlets in the study area and their GPS coordinates were recorded. Stores that sold any kind of e-cigarette were considered as point of sales (POS). E-cigarette outlet coordinates were collected by six pairs of trained enumerators after attending 3 days of training session. The enumerators determined the e-cigarette outlet by looking for e-cigarette displays, seeing the purchase of e-cigarettes, or approaching the retailer personally in cases when none of these were apparent. The enumerators completed an electronic checklist on Kobo Toolbox embedded in their mobile phone. It included POS ID, name of POS, type of POS, GPS coordinates of e-cigarette shops and selling points, advertisements placed in the shop, and any institutions located near 100m and 500m within the shop. In this section, this study analyzed the distribution of e-cigarette shops, and types of shops, and assessed their proximity to academic institutions and hospitals. The collected GPS points are extracted from Kobo Toolbox and imported into GIS software, specifically ArcGIS for spatial analysis. For GIS mapping, this study used ArcGIS Pro software by ESRI (licensed version) and the scale is 1:100000. The POS location points collected from fields are plotted in the GIS attribute for mapping and showing the distribution of those POS. All the GIS maps are solely developed by the author. The output maps are produced using projected coordinate system of UTM (Zone 45N). In the GIS environment, firstly a distribution map of e-cigarette shops across Dhaka City was formed, encompassing both the North and South City Corporation areas. This map visually represents the spatial dispersion of e-cigarette shops. Additionally, a secondary map is generated to categorize the several types of e-cigarette shops. This provides essential information on the specific classifications or categories of e-cigarette shops present within the study area. Moving forward, a buffer analysis is undertaken to ascertain the distribution of e-cigarette shops within a defined radius of hospitals. In this case, a buffer zone of 100 meters is established around hospital locations to identify which e-cigarette shops fall within this designated zone. To further assess the proximity of academic institutions to e-cigarette shops, a multi-buffer ring analysis was conducted to determine the presence of academic institutions within specified distances, such as 100 meters and 500 meters, from e-cigarette shops. Multiple buffer zones were created around the e-cigarette shop locations to facilitate this evaluation. The qualitative interview guideline was formed through the analysis of pertinent and significant literature, and pre-testing was carried out before of the data collection. Through the use of an open-ended questionnaire, data were gathered based on the respondents’ convenience. Before of the interview, brief descriptions of the study’s background, objectives, eligibility requirements, confidentiality, anonymity, and informed consent of each responder were provided and explained pleasantly to the interviewees and attached also in the first page of the guideline. The IDI guideline was formed, including questions such as perceptions regarding e-cigarettes, the e-cigarette distribution process, marketing strategies concerning e-cigarette distribution, and so on. In addition, the KII guideline was also formed based on perceptions about e-cigarettes, the import mechanism of e-cigarettes and how to reduce the importation of e-cigarettes, the concept of distribution and marketing strategy of e-cigarettes, if there is any support for reducing/banning e-cigarette use in Bangladesh, and so on. Prior to the interview, each respondent was provided full informed consent and made sure that the participants understood the reasons for inviting, the risks, privacy, anonymity, and confidentiality, as well as their right to withdraw and not participate. In the interview, we also ensured that they were under no obligation to continue and might end at any time. Interviewers made an effort to find a location with the fewest disruptions. Most of the interviews were around 45 min, and the audio was recorded to ensure validity. Additionally, we got their permission to record the interview on audio. The field notes were also taken to address any extra essential information. To facilitate the exploration of the inner meaning and uncover the phenomenon under investigation, data were gathered in the native language of the respondents. To maintain the anonymity of each respondent, we assigned ID numbers to them. The interviews had to be transcribed verbatim, coded, and summarized by the proficient native Bengali data enumerators. Finally, no incentives were provided to study participants to encourage their participation. This study created geographical maps with ArcGIS Pro software by ESRI. Descriptive statistics (frequency and percentage) were computed to find out the proportion of POS in each city corporation and the percentage of POS types. On the other hand, transcripts of the interviews were read and reviewed carefully, coded under different themes, and finally were analyzed by narrative review method. To ensure accuracy, the transcripts and audio recordings were cross-checked for any inconsistencies. A priori codebook was used, which was developed through reviewing relevant literature and the thematic analysis was performed following the themes identifying techniques [38], where texts were extracted and summarized through manual coding. Finally, to explain the results, the data were methodically indexed, synthesized, and evaluated. The interviews were conducted in accordance with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration, and the highest ethical standards were maintained throughout the study. Ethical permission was obtained from the institutional review board (IRB), ‘Biosafety, Biosecurity & Ethical Committee’ (Ref No: BBEC, JU/M 2023/05 (30)) of the Jahangirnagar University, Savar, Dhaka. Furthermore, individual informed consent was taken from all participants who read/understood the purpose of the study before data collection. We found a total of 276 e-cigarette shops in Dhaka City, among them the majority (56.5%) were in Dhaka North City Corporation followed by Dhaka South City Corporation (43.5%). Among the POS in both South and North city corporations, the highest POS type was watch or sunglass shops (26.8%) followed by dedicated vape shops (26.4%), cigarette shops (17.4%), and cosmetics shops (12.7%), electronics shops (4%) etc. (Table 1). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312802.t001 The bar graph illustrates the percentage of POS distribution based on City Corporation. In DSCC, the highest percentage POS type was watches and sunglasses shops (40%) followed by dedicated vape shops (20.8%), cigarette shops (18.3%). On the other hand, in DNCC majority was dedicated vape shops (30.8%), while the same proportion of watch/sunglass and cigarettes shops were noticed at 16.7% (Fig 1). The distribution of several institutions is presented in Table 2. The bar graph illustrates the percentage of POS distribution based on City Corporation.

It is observed that most of the POS located at shopping malls in both city corporations, whereas 55.0% in DSCC and 37.8% in DNCC followed by 5.1% (DNCC) and 2.5% (DSCC) in residential house, 3.8% (DNCC) and 0.8% (DSCC) in super shop (Fig 2). Moreover, advertisements related information has been depicted in Fig 3. In Table 2 presents the diverse types of institutions found within 100 meters of different POSs according to observation. Highest 39 (48.1%) colleges, 36 (44.4%) high schools and 15 (18.5%) hospitals were found within 100 meters of different POS locations. We got only one kindergarten within 100 meters of one of our POS locations. The diagram shows the percentage of different institutions within 100 meters of POSs according to observation. In Dhaka North City Corporation, the highest number of institutions that were found in front or within 100 meters of POS location were colleges (59.2%) and high schools (53.1%) respectively followed by coaching center (20.4%), primary schools (18.4%) etc. The lowest percentage of kindergartens (2%) was found near different POS locations. On the other hand, in Dhaka South City Corporation, maximum percentage of institutions was found within 100 meters of POSs were colleges (31.3%), high schools (31.3%) and hospitals (31.3%) followed by banks (25%), Clinics (18.8%) etc. while the lowest percentage was for coaching centers (6.3%) (Fig 4).

It can be observed that the majority of advertisements were displayed as posters (64.1%). Additionally, 23.1% of the advertisements were displayed as billboards, while the remaining 20.5% were shown as banners.

The results provide a comprehensive analysis of the distribution of e-shops in both Dhaka North City Corporation and Dhaka South City Corporation (Figs 5 and 6) respectively. For instance, within Dhaka North City Corporation, it is identified that 16 e-cigarette shops are situated within 100 meters of academic institutions. Similarly, within Dhaka South City Corporation, there are 39 e-cigarette shops within 100 meters of academic institutions (Figs 7 and 8) respectively. The e-cigarette shops located within the 100-meter buffer zone of hospitals are visually represented on the map (Fig 9). This visualization allows for a comprehensive understanding of the spatial relationship between e-cigarette shops, healthcare facilities, and educational institutions. Finally, the maps generated from the spatial analysis are carefully interpreted and analyzed to identify the patterns of e-cigarette shop distribution and their proximity to hospitals and academic institutions. This analysis has significant implications for understanding potential health risks associated with e-cigarette usage in close proximity to healthcare facilities and educational settings. The results of the buffer and multi-buffer ring analysis are graphically represented on the map. The results provide a comprehensive analysis of the distribution of e-shops in Dhaka North City Corporation. From the map, it is evident that Uttara, Mirpur, Gulshan, Banani, and Adabor are the areas with the highest concentration of e-shops in DNCC.

E-cigarettes do not contain tar. It uses synthetic nicotine. Since it is vaporizing, it does not seem to be a big deal. It may have featured a coil system and was installable with a liquid that has a sticky appearance. Four components, Propylene glycol (PG), Vegetable glycerin (VG), flavoring, and nicotine must all be present in a juice to be used. Propylene glycol, sometimes known as PG, is a colorless, odorless liquid. Vegetable glycerin, on the other hand, referred to as VG has a little sweet flavor and a slightly thicker consistency. According to the responses of retailers: The electronic cigarettes were rechargeable and looked like long pens. It was compatible with liquid installations and included maybe coil system.” [R03.001] “Regarding devices, the crucial elements are the battery, the Power IC for control, and the coils for activation. These coils are crucial for the process of converting the e-liquid into vapor. When it comes to e-liquids, there are four essential components that you need: propylene glycol (PG), vegetable glycerin (VG), flavoring, and nicotine. All four elements are essential for an enjoyable and satisfying vaping experience.” [R01.001] E-cigarette retailers believe that these products pose fewer health risks than traditional cigarettes due to their adjustable nicotine levels and lower nicotine content. However, they also mentioned some negative aspects- such as water can lodge in the lungs causing blockages and leading to abdominal gas. However, if nicotine is consumed in excess, several issues may arise. For example, stomach issues, one also has headaches, sinusitis, and migraines. Additionally, it has a nicotine tobacco flavor, which increases the risk of heart attack, certain flavors are ice flavor, which causes a cold, and occasionally it affects the throat and causes cancer when used frequently. Regarding all of these issues, retailers have confessed that: “Everything has side effects. ome chemicals are safe to breath, while others are harmful to human health. Consuming fruit-flavored juice will not affect your health. Fruit-flavored juice will not harm your body if you take it. When you consume that clone juice you will be harmed. Because they do not maintain food grade. Burning anything produces a tar that is inhaled and causes bacterial infections, as well as cancer due to chemicals.” [R03.007] “Blueberry drink is often unsuitable for a large number of people, who often choose not to consume it. However, few people complain of gastrointestinal discomfort from its use. Besides, I have not seen any trouble so far. If you smoke cigarettes for 90 to 100 years, then the risk of cancer is 100%. E-cigarettes are not carcinogenic. Cancer cells remain dormant in our body until they are triggered into activity by our unhealthy lifestyle choices. Subsequently, the cigarette is regarded as a medium that individuals believe is responsible for certain outcomes.” [R03.001] The key informants of our study talked about the health hazards associated with e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes contain non-natural substances, such as chemicals and juices, which can lead to various forms of cancer and affect the organs when burned. Other illnesses, such as asthma, may also manifest as well and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may occur. In addition, e-cigarette use by children can hinder brain development and, with prolonged use, may lead to a decrease in intelligence quotient (IQ). Furthermore, long-term nicotine use is likely to raise our risk of heart attack or stroke due to the atherosclerotic disease process that nicotine causes. “E-Cigarette contains nicotine means e-cigarettes are harmful to health and I say e-cigarette is never a substitute for a conventional cigarette I say it is not safe. Formaldehyde and acetate are very harmful to the body. As I have said before, even in our developed countries, there is a lot of research on e-cigarettes. The Japanese say that this cigarette is 10 times more harmful than normal cigarettes, because of its use which may lead to the development of various diseases including stroke, heart attack, or cardiac attack. E-cigarettes are in no way less harmful than traditional cigarettes.” [KII-05] “Long-term use of nicotine may lead to the development of atherosclerosis, a condition that increases the likelihood of heart attack or stroke. In addition, the presence of additional compounds in the substance might occasionally provide a danger of pneumonitis or lung infection. Furthermore, it is seen with many impurities due to which people have died. Nicotine is the cause of our addiction. It harms brain development when used by children. It may gradually decrease the level of intelligence if it is used extensively.” [KII-04] People between the ages of 20 and 35 are the most common users, and the younger generation tends to smoke it more frequently. The age range of female consumers is 18 to 40 years old, while that of male customers is 18 to 60 years old. Although children utilize it now, but the sellers do not support them in doing so. Since there are no rules there, children purchase from the sidewalk. Street vendors would profit more if they could sell more goods. “A mother of an intermediate student once came into the store complaining that her son was unable to concentrate on his studies without vaping. Another time, a 15-year-old boy arrived, and we advised him to start vaping after a few days. Later, the mother of the youngster arrived and said, "I’ll buy it for my son, so why should you have any problems?" [R03.007] All types of customers come here but the sellers do not sell to kids. People their 25 years and 30 years old make up the largest attendance group. The younger generation makes the most use of it. Although people of other ages visit as well, teenagers appear to come mostly to purchase vape. Older individuals, including those in their 40s and beyond, also frequent the place. Both lone individuals and groups make up the bulk. Middle-aged individuals typically smoke a large quantity of cigarettes throughout the day. They then encourage their friends who smoke to transition to e-cigarettes rather than continuing to smoke. Thus, friends influence friends. More boys come, while the number of girls is very limited. School-age students now visit during tiffin breaks and smoke cigarettes in tea stalls. “The majority of my customers are younger buyers, particularly those under 15 years old. Most of them are students, with boys from well-off families above 20 years old also making up a significant portion of my customer base. Around 70% of my customers are boys, while the remaining 30% are girls. Many of the girls are regular customers, with 5–6 of them coming to buy regularly. They usually come alone rather than in a group, except for the 7/8-year-old school children who come in groups. Additionally, it is common for one friend to bring another friend to buy on different days.” [R12.012] “The target audience is typically 18 to 24 years old. It’s becoming popular online, especially with active internet users who post cloud photos on Facebook. It’s a trending topic and can go viral” [RA12.001] “Small children also come but we have fewer here, go to the shop in Kurmitola and many school and college students come to buy e-cigarettes. Kids get interested in e-cigarettes by seeing others using them or seeing e-cigarette devices. And the boys and girls of Dhaka are a little more updated.” [R04.016] Everyone knows that cigarettes are bad for people in this day, particularly in the age of social media. However, users of e-cigarettes prefer to consume them to stop smoking. They believe that e-cigarettes are a safer option. E-cigarettes are less dangerous when compared to traditional cigarettes as they do not produce Bad odors. Here, there is more flavor addiction than nicotine addiction. In addition, it has become a direct fashion, so everyone wants to try it. There is a growing trend among the younger generation to associate vaping with being trendy and cool. Unlike traditional cigarettes, which emit strong odors and are often not tolerated in many places, e-cigarettes can be used almost anywhere. But people can use vape everywhere. Due to having these kinds of advantages people like to use e-cigarettes. “The reason is flavor addiction. Nicotine addiction is less here, flavor addiction is more. When you have a mango flavor in your mouth all day long, when you have an apple flavor, it feels a little soothing. So, there are the main things, flavors. They come back for the flavor.” [RA08.001] “Those who are over 30 years old are mostly smokers. They use vaping to abstain from smoking. People of this type mostly come to me. Some people come and tell me I want to quit smoking and suggest some flavorful vape. Some come here to buy vape due to the scent and flavor. I think most importantly people are using vaping as a substitute for smoking. If you light a cigarette near anyone, they think badly about them. If you do vape people do not think it is bad. It is seen that many have quit smoking due to vaping” [RA12.002] “The first reason behind this is that the customers consider this thing to be safe by using it by them. They did not have any problems. In addition, as the way we told them to use it, they follow that. By doing so they enjoyed vaping” [R01.001] In Bangladesh, e-cigarettes are not manufactured by any company. Instead, e-cigarette importers bring in various vaping devices and juices from other countries. These products are then supplied to wholesalers, distributors, and retailers in Bangladesh. Retailers from dedicated vape shops, other physical stores, and online stores sell e-cigarette products directly to consumers. “I brought all kinds of devices from China. Although the original brands are from the USA and UK, the products are manufactured in China. In addition, some Swiss ones are made in Switzerland that are very expensive. But they do not come to Bangladesh now, they used to come earlier” (R03.001) “All my juices here are from America and all devices are from China” (RO4.013) “…These companies are foreign companies. In our country no vape is produced, vapes come from outside countries. We have no authority over this matter” (RA12.002) “USA and China. I order the devices from China and liquid from the UK and USA. Liquid is also available in China, but we do not import” (R03.005) Our study respondents have shared that Mirpur, Gulistan, Dhanmondi, Nikunja, Baridhara, Gulshan, Banani, Uttara, etc. are the major hotspot of e-cigarettes. One of our responses mentioned that there is a factory in Chakbazar, from which they get the e-cigarettes. “In terms of availability, I would say Dhanmondi. In addition, if you say in the case of use, then in that case I will say Gulshan or Banani” (R01.001) “You will find it mostly in the Chalkbazar. If you want to see new types of vapes, you can visit Chalkbazar. They go wholesale there. Friendship market, 10 no. Lane. You can find more information regarding vaping there. They buy thousands of pieces” (RA12.002) Respondents also stated that e-cigarette marketing is expanding in places where more wealthy people stay. According to them, many people are already accustomed to these types of cigarettes and these are becoming available in every shopping complex. “You can find them in New Supermarket, Mirpur, Elephant Road, and Bashundhara City. Vapes are now sold in every shopping complex as an essential item, just like rice and fish. Sometimes using vapes makes everyone look smart” (RA12.001) “There are many shops in Gulistan. The residents of that area have more money, while the people in our area have less. It’s important to understand that there is a strong connection between the e-cigarette business and its location.” (R04.016) Long-term vaping has been shown to have negative health impacts; its replicas may even be more detrimental. In the case of inquiry regarding the availability of replicas, retailers emphasized that they are selling the original product imported from abroad, but there are many sellers of e-cigarettes in Chawkbazar, Newmarket, and Old Dhaka engaged in selling replica products. “I do not know if it is in Bangladesh or not but maybe in China. Dhaka New Market and Street Shop sell clones/replicas; they seem to sell Chinese juice. I am selling American Juice” (RO4.013) “I do not know that brother. It may happen. Nothing is impossible here, everything is possible…If you want to see them, then you will have to walk around the streets of Chawkbazar, Jinjira” (R04.016) “Replica means disposable devices; there are some clones of disposables in Bangladesh. There are several clone products available in Newmarket, they import them from China” (R05.001) Retailers’ comments indicate that e-cigarette duplicates are produced nearby, notably at Chawkbazar. Although it is challenging to replicate the device, fake juice may be made cheaply and sold for a lesser price. Since many people cannot afford the original e-cigarette and its fluids, these could boost marketing among the general public. One person described the procedure for creating replica juices, which he had heard from people he knew. “However, apart from the authentic products, clone products are available in the Round Square under the foot over the bridge and in the new market with budget money. We sell 100 ml in 1800 to 2400 taka. They sell 30 ml for 300 taka, which we cannot imagine. Replica juice does not come from another country; they are made in our own Bangladesh. Made in Jinjira and sold in Chawkbazar. The whole thing is distributed from Chawkbazar. Pod devices are not usually cloned. They are difficult to clone. Mod devices are often cloned” (R03.007) Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, TikTok, etc. are being used extensively as a way of buying and selling different kinds of products. Online marketing of e-cigarettes is also growing in Bangladesh. These also allow the sharing of necessary information regarding e-cigarettes, like their flavors, prices, promotional messages, delivery process, etc. Our study respondent stated that online media have made the e-cigarette business and delivery process easier as well. Online media, apps, and websites related to shopping, such as Daraz are also involved in e-cigarette marketing. “…Yes, Facebook, and Instagram. The page is mainly for online delivery of parcels. We don’t post videos on YouTube. Customers can place orders via WhatsApp and receive home delivery. We only deliver through Instagram if someone comments on the product’s picture or sends a personal message.” (R03.007) “Through online, we do business through our Facebook page. We also have a website. However, if it is in the case of wholesale, then it is normal to talk on the phone. So roughly, you can catch these dealings through WhatsApp or over the phone” (R01.001) “No, I do not give Ads. Daraz gives an ad… Yes, everything is available in Daraz. Over 90% of goods are sold in Daraz” (RA08.003) Moreover, some retailers also shared that in-store selling of e-cigarettes is more feasible for them. According to them, the promotion of this specific product in social media may become the reason for governmental sanction. Retailers have to keep themselves busy by selling different kinds of products at once in their stores. According to them, e-cigarette sales are more in their store than the online platform. Online business for e-cigarettes has become tougher for them, except for the dedicated e-cigarette shops. “Online promotion of tobacco products is prohibited by the government, and this also extends to social media.I do not know if it goes to foreign countries. Online sales for tobacco products are generally poor, as most transactions occur in physical stores” (R03.001) “Long ago, I had a Facebook page called "Gazette King" where I posted pictures. Now I do not run it. My shop sells more than the page. Those who have free time can browse the page. I do not have that time” (R12.012) A few retailers acknowledged that they offer electronic cigarettes offline as well as online. “Both online order and direct selling… Since home delivery is an option, many people also want to visit the shop… I would say 20% is online. We have many in-shop customers” (RA08.001) To promote products retailers rarely use postering or other offline marketing. Dedicated shops for e-cigarette marketing use online marketing strategies more than that of physical stores that sell these devices as a side business. They depend on online marketing strategies more and advise customers to see or give reviews on Facebook and other business apps. Discounts are offered occasionally, but it is not maintained according to any specific product or occasion. First-time customers are given some benefits. To generate interest in their products, they have a range of eye-catching e-cigarettes featured on their website (also, their Facebook page features numerous images of e-cigarettes) for their eyes to perceive the attraction. In addition, they just say they will sell it at a low price, even if the customers take the flavor they will sell it also at a low price. The people who see the product know the value, and that is why they buy it. Therefore, there is nothing to make lucrative here. They try to give advertisements, but there is a risk of banning the page. Customer satisfaction and taste addiction are also factors. There has been observed an alluring representation of different types of devices in the store. Retailers also use verbal explanations and motivation, which convince them to buy e-cigarettes. Some statements of respondents are given below: “I always ask customers about their vaping needs, whether it’s for creating big clouds or to help quit smoking. Based on their response, I introduce them to different products. I had mentioned earlier that e-cigarettes can be harmful, although less than traditional cigarettes. We tell people that it is also harmful to those who do not know. Keep a few interesting e-cigarettes now and then. We do not show. We put a variety of interesting e-cigarettes on the online page (Facebook page) just to make people interested that we have some interesting vapes in our store. So that the attraction works in their eyes” [R03.001] “I will sell it also at a low price. There was a separate display case for vaping on one side of the shop. A customer was shown an interesting vape device that looked like a pistol” [R12.012] “It is more or less, everyone involved in marketing. Anyone who has any stock is taking pictures and just sharing them. Just this. Because of the way our vaping thing is, we do not need to make it lucrative here. Many people recognize the value of our product and that’s why they buy it” [R01.001] During the pandemic, companies have provided e-cigarettes to households via social media. Therefore, since there is no law, they take advantage of every tactic at their disposal to attract customers. They have chosen to target a specific age group, especially the young generation, so that is where they will draw it out and brand it to sustain the business for a long period. After conducting research, the tobacco businesses discovered that lowering the price is necessary to reach more individuals. They are using a technique to lower the price because of this. They might be strategizing ways to reduce the cost of the products. The market will grow as more people become dependent on it. In addition, in the drama industry, the producers and directors receive financial support to maintain scenes featuring smoking electronic cigarettes for promotional purposes. “The marketing strategy seems to involve targeted social media campaigns. Users who are in the young group are sent targeted messages with information and in terms of marketing they use online marketing mostly and now it is available in different stores and different markets” [KII-04] “I have seen that they have targeted an age group, meaning the target group is where, even under the grave, they will pull it out and then brand it. Therefore, not only an educational institution but also the age group, that age group is their target. They grab a group between the ages of twelve and twenty. So, if they can make them addicted, I said they will do business for up to 75 years. They will not show much interest in an old 55–60-year-old person like me. Since I could pass away before I turn eight or ten years old. There is no profit in investing in this business. So, they target the place where that age group is available [KII-01] “The tobacco companies have researched and found that if it is to reach people, they have to bring down the price. That is why they are bringing down the price by strategy. They may be planning how to make the devices cheaper. They have a plan. Nothing happens to them without planning. When he becomes dependent, the market will expand. It may be, now their sales are maybe 10,000 per year. So, if the price is reduced it may increase the sales to 20000 per year” [KII-02] “It seems to me that the promotion is an increase in dramas, which was not before. Coca-Cola spent a lot of money to feature the brand in an Aamir Khan movie. So now, if they show smoking, maybe they take at least a few cores to show a smoking scene for only 10 seconds to 20 seconds. These are industry promotions. In drama, it is the producers and directors who are given money to keep this scene in our drama industry promotion. And especially if there is a popular actor-actress, and in our OTT platform, I do not see that much, but I have heard from people who study that the hero is in a bad mood, takes e-cigarettes, drinks, takes cigarettes, even when he is in a good mood. The matter is like that” [KII-03] The sellers emphasized promoting e-cigarettes by expressing that, these e-cigarettes can cause some harm, but they are still less than traditional cigarettes, which is yet unproven. The customers unaware of those statements become well-informed, while the aware do not need an explanation beforehand to buy e-cigarettes. They offer options to customers and give them a polite explanation when they arrive. When a consumer visits, the sellers first try to understand their preferences and reasons for vaping. Customers who were trying to give up smoking were assisted in selecting juice. “Normal cigarettes have bad smells. Maybe that causes them problems. Their wives may scold them for smoking. If they use vape, they will not have any problems. At home, they can use vape too.” [RA12.002] “When a customer comes to us, we first try to understand his preferences and why he wants to vape. If he comes to quit smoking, we help him choose juice.” [R05.001] “In my opinion, if you like it, then go ahead and take it. When you take it, the smoke will come out, but if you don’t take it, the smoke won’t come out. This is just the approach. I do not tell someone to buy it. I do not tell them it is good, take it.” [RA08.003] E-cigarette sales are largely dependent on liquid and device quality. Only those who are aware of e-cigarettes purchase the devices; others do not. On Facebook, the sellers do only post. The vast majority of the sellers do not write sales-oriented statements outside the shop. Their clients handle the majority of their marketing. Because a satisfied customer will refer five more customers to purchase the product. Therefore, the sellers do not need that type of marketing that much. “It has to be said that the customer will not understand which is good and which is bad. Flavor, device, price, and quality are different. It is better than smoked cigarettes, I usually say. If the smoke is more, the quality will be better. If the coil is damaged, you can change it here. You will get liquid of many flavors, I will keep less money, its quality will be better—this is what I say” [R12.012] “I will not say any such slogans or statements. Slogan base statement we will give when we protest it. We do not need to protest. We are doing something good. If you want to join us, you can join. There are many anti-alcohol protests, but there are a few people here who are anti-alcohol. So, we do not have slogans for these things. We are providing safer options if you can join you can join. See how you like it. If you like the culture, then you can live with it” [R01.001] Retailers stated that they do not offer any advertisements about the marketing of e-cigarettes, although they have been noticed on Facebook sites, YouTube, and Instagram. Facebook features advertisements, and users have the option to see reviews and watch videos on vaping. Sometimes, Daraz occasionally runs advertisements. “No, brother, currently YouTube is your platform for giving reviews. We mainly operate through reviews. For example, we recently reviewed Jellybox, and we set the Google price at 2600, but we sold it for 2400. We offer discounts on each product” [RA12.001] “Every shop has signage outside. Like we have the ‘Vape in’ (shop name) logo outside in large form. So, we keep all branding up to the shop. Yes, there is a review system. However, this culture has not yet developed in Bangladesh” [R01.001] Among them, one of the people shared his experience in another way as if he had seen an ad regarding this: “I have seen an ad for another shop. Like a few days ago, “BARBIE” came out. Like this they took a picture which has “TANBIE” with the picture of the vape” [RA08.001] The majority of the sellers do not give any written advertisement. People do not post product details that much now unless it is a second-hand selling post. Maximum people know about vape, in that case, sellers give the name of the product and the flavor of the juice. If customers want to know the rest, they can search on Google. “No (Smiling). I have never seen an advertisement for e-cigarettes.” [RO4.013] Some of them shared that some written statements they use for marketing like- It is less harmful than smoky cigarettes, waking up and smelling vape, and so on. “Coil it, wick it, juice it, vape it; Eat, sleep, vape; It’s glamorous on film but it’s not glamorous, waking up and smelling vape like an ashtray; Keep calm and vape like an ashtray; More stronger, more tasty; Under age 18 is prohibited” [R03.007] Regarding giveaways for retailers to promote e-cigarettes, the majority of the sellers shared that they do not get anything regarding this, if a device breaks, it is the vendors’ fault, and they are not even eligible for a refund. However, gifts are provided when something is sold in the market as well and those who import it may get it. “The thing is that vape is now sold at large. No need for them to give discounts. The wholesalers buy them from foreign countries. If they buy them at a cheap price, they can give some discount. Getting a discount from the company is not possible. These are for limited profit” [RA12.002] “I used to get it, but now I do not get it. When a new design or model of a product comes, they would give a new model along with the previous product model. They said that a new one has come and please check the device without cost.” [R03.001] Regarding sales, there is a single computation. Sellers might increase sales by lowering their prices. Because not everyone can afford to purchase vaping items at all. The internet pages must be visited, posts must be created, and they must be promoted to enhance sales. Opening more locations in well-located retail centers will be necessary to boost e-cigarette sales. The difference is in how things work offline and online. Selling products online has the potential to boost sales. People prefer to purchase more things when they watch the advertisement. Additionally, there are cash-back incentives, which is a wonderful addition. “In order to boost sales, we need to open online pages, create posts, and promote them. While there are some complications, they are manageable, and the main challenge is the time commitment. The sale of any item depends on marketing, if the marketing is good, the sales will increase.” [R04.016] Despite the high costs, they wish to open a new branch. If the system for cash back is implemented, it will benefit them. But if it is all governed by the established guidelines and oversight, they will also help to promote it. The uncertainty surrounding the government’s recent declaration regarding e-cigarettes is a cause for alarm, though. “First we have to create the market, we have to expand the business, and then we have to do the promotion. Now it is too late to bring the product. However, when everything is regulated by an official organization, everything will be under supervision, and then there will be demand. I will get the product quickly. Then the market will be created.” [R03.007] Regarding the views of the sellers, rather than prohibiting it, the government should promote it. The sellers have no control over it. If the government bans it, they will do other business. Alcohol and cigarettes are legal. Even if the government forbids them, they are powerless to challenge its decisions because their decisions are final. After that, they will stop selling it. Apart from banning e-cigarettes, smoking should be outlawed at the same time. Again, British Tobacco has been pressuring the government for several years to ban e-cigarettes. Because e-cigarettes have caused a decline in their sales in the market. However, the seller plans to tell the government, that if e-cigarettes are less harmful than normal cigarettes, then they should not stop them. “if the government closes it, I will do another business. If it closes, there is no problem; there is no lack of business. And I am a small one and those who have big businesspeople will think about them.” [RO4.013] “If they ban it, we will be at a loss. It will be better if they do not ban it. People of all ages can use it. And cigarettes cannot be used everywhere. E-cigarettes can be used everywhere, and smokers of all ages can use them. There is no obstacle. If you stop it, the bad people, the drunk party people, will get more addicted to other substances. If they vape, the risk will not be so much.” [R12.012] One of them also shared regarding governments’ approach to forever banning e-cigarettes in the future in another way like “They (government) have tried. But we have powerful people. We will fight to continue it. Because I know cigarettes are bad. Now if the government of Bangladesh wants people to die by smoking cigarettes that is fine. We will try our best.” [RA08.001] In response to inquiries, key informants of our study have shared some challenging issues for E-cigarette banning in Bangladesh. One of the main obstacles to limiting the marketing of e-cigarettes is their addictive nature, which stems from their thousands of flavors and appealing designs. Some of the respondents claim that those connected to the e-cigarette wholesale industry could obstruct the enactment and maintenance of e-cigarette control legislation. Furthermore, a few massive tobacco industries may have influenced legislators. Nevertheless, to expedite the e-cigarette ban, the health ministries must work harmoniously with other ministries in an integrative manner. “The business of addictive products is enormous. As a result, consumers who purchase these products often behave irrationally. Their behavior is not rational when it comes to buying these products. Even when they know that addiction is a risk, the price does not deter them. Their addiction is driven by the product’s flavor. Despite being aware of the negative consequences, they continue to support the business. These consumers are so heavily influenced that they cannot grasp the logic behind their actions. It all boils down to the money going into the pockets of those behind the business, which the consumers willingly spend.” [KII 1] “Regarding the challenge of the ban, I said that those who are very normal, those who are associated with this business, those who are planning this business, and those who will produce it in this country, want this law not to be passed, maybe they will delay this law. They will do two things, first not to pass. Compromise will come in the second stage, weakening it a bit. What do you mean weak? They will say that it is not a ban, they will talk about control. As we call the Tobacco Control Law, so is the E-Cigarette Control Law. That is how to control it”. [KII-1] “The first is that tobacco companies are giant companies. They influence everything from the policy level. Therefore, this is a big challenge. And their tactics are bad, they create influence where there are policymakers to motivate them in different ways. So that is a challenge for us. Another big challenge that we face is that we policymakers need to look at these issues from a public health perspective; as this is a public health issue” [KII2] “It seems that there are significant challenges related to industry restrictions. The Ministry of Health has tried to initiate changes to the law in order to protect public health. However, there is a lack of support from other ministries such as the Ministry of Industries, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Finance, and NBR. It appears that these ministries prioritize financial gain over public health, making it difficult to enact the necessary changes. This lack of support has ultimately prevented the correction from taking place. It seems that there are internal barriers preventing the progress of these crucial amendments. [KII 3] For Bangladesh’s e-cigarette ban to be successful, it is crucial to implement specific measures to oppose the extensive marketing and promotion of these items. Currently, there is no law in Bangladesh regarding e-cigarettes. Based on the responses from our key informants, we know that campaigns against e-cigarette banning have been going on for more than three years. Furthermore, the government of Bangladesh has already drafted a bill that will shortly be approved by the parliament. Additionally, there is a variety of non-governmental organizations and anti-tobacco organizations working on awareness campaigns about these problems. “There is no law, there is nothing. We tried to say, it should be banned. And the campaign is going on for 2–3 years… and the government has decided in principle, a draft has been prepared. Now it was supposed to be raised before this election in the cabinet, no, after the election we hope, if there is no major interference, it will be passed here and then it will be passed in the parliament. Therefore, this has been a movement from civil society for a long time. The Government is also motivated, the Ministry of Health of the Government has made a regulation” [KII 1] “There are different foundations they create front groups to bring these things, create business groups like we all know “Smoke-Free Foundation” they promote this e-cigarette all over the world as harm reduction” [KII- 4] “Not only NGOs, all the anti-tobacco organizations in Bangladesh are working on it, that it is harmful to the body and health, that it should be banned, all the anti-tobacco organizations in Bangladesh, not only a particular NGO, BCCP, who give you these grants, also work on it”. [KII 1] “We held press conferences, rallies, discussion meetings, and wrote different articles…Our organization has a Facebook page called Tobacco Free Bangladesh. If you go there, you will see that we posted about this cigarette. We also have a YouTube channel called DAM-Health. There we made a video about e-cigarettes and gave a message to make people aware. We re-share those videos on Facebook. In this way, we are making people aware… At the national level, not only us but many organizations, and some other anti-tobacco organizations have conducted programs on e-cigarettes. However, at the local level, I do not think anyone is doing it at the district level or upazila level. Because till now it remains a national issue because there is no law.” [KII -2] “No, there is no finalized law and policy in Bangladesh so far. The Tobacco Control Act of 2005 has been amended once in 2013 having some loopholes. The revision work is still ongoing. This has been proposed in this amendment of the Act… Organizations working in the tobacco control community. As I work for people many other foundations work for people. Like the National Heart Foundation and Ahsania Mission, we have some alliances with doctors and the media. E.g., Bangladesh Anti-Tobacco Alliance, and Anti-Tobacco Media Alliance. Some such alliances and some individual organizations and individuals are doing the work regularly” [KII-5] We can incorporate certain important steps to regulate or restrict e-cigarettes in Bangladesh based on the key informant’s responses. Its importation must be halted under the particular HS code. Strict regulations should be in place surrounding the marketing of e-cigarettes, and those who sell these products without a license must be compensated. The purchase of electronic cigarette devices should be restricted based on age and information about the harmful health effects of e-cigarettes. Since children and adolescents grow up in monitored environments, we can make sure that their use of e-cigarettes is strictly prohibited. The sale of e-cigarettes in the stores next to various educational institutions ought to be prohibited. Since e-cigarettes are portrayed as a healthy substitute for regular cigarettes, we can raise consciousness about the negative health impacts of e-cigarettes and encourage smokers to pursue other nicotine replacement therapies. “The first thing is that importation with HS code should be stopped. Imports should be stopped and then other routes that come in should slowly tried to be stopped. Apart from that, to stop the distribution, if you give the facility to import with HS code, then to distribute it—it is a legitimate product, anyone can distribute & sell it as they can. We did not arrange the license or anything like that.” [KII 4] “Already e-cigarette has been banned in India… It is prescribed as a prescription drug in the UK. Those who wish to quit at once and it is not being given to anyone under 18 years of age… meaning there is an age limit. In America, they have made a rule that no flavor can be given. It is only given to those who want to quit tobacco, but they have banded off the flavors that would have been given to attract children. Besides, many other countries have completely banned it. At the local level, it should strictly ensure that children do not come to school with this item…Now the average initiation age for e-cigarette sage in Bangladesh is 15–16 years old… Doctors also are prescribing because it is available in the market. If it becomes illegal then there is no chance to prescribe…We have nicotine replacement therapy for nicotine, nicotine gum, and nicotine lozenges…” [KII 4] “I have no idea about reducing distribution. I have no idea about the distribution mechanism. It has to be Law/Policy Implementation. The sale of e-cigarettes under the age of 18 cannot be implemented in our country. We have to ban it…import, export, production, marketing everything is prohibited…All types of production, marketing, sale, purchase, and marketing should be banned. Besides, we cannot give a healthy Bangladesh to the next generation. Our present people who are in policy-making, will not be alive anymore, they are supporting such activities and misdeeds for their benefit. Those who come after that will be victims of it. And many people will get sick, the young generation will suffer, and it will drive them to other addictions.” [KII-3] This study provides insights regarding the availability, distribution, marketing strategy, and possible ways to reduce e-cigarettes in Bangladesh. First of all, the participants of the study perceived e-cigarettes as long, pen-shaped rechargeable devices that may have included a coil system and installable liquid with a sticky appearance that uses synthetic nicotine and does not include tar, which supports earlier research showing that e-cigarettes are battery-operated devices that heat and aerosolize "e-liquid." [39], and which requires inhaling vaporized nicotine during consumption [40], and the dangerous ingredients found in regular cigarettes, such as tar and carcinogens, were absent in e-cigarettes [40]. This study also shows that there are two main differences between traditional cigarettes and e-cigarettes: conventional cigarettes contain more nicotine than e-cigarettes, but e-cigarettes do not contain tar, which can lead to cancer. According to a previous study, it was found that many people believed e-cigarettes to be healthier than traditional cigarettes because they do not contain tar, smoke, or carcinogens [40]. Some participants also noted that e-cigarettes have lesser side effects than conventional cigarettes and help to normal cigarettes cessation. These findings are consistent with a previous study [41]. Regarding e-cigarette health impacts, our research found that besides serious issues like blockages, water can lodge in the lungs and produce abdominal gas. Additionally, using e-cigarettes may result in headaches, migraines, sinusitis, and gastrointestinal problems. It also contains nicotine tobacco flavor, which raises the risk of a heart attack; some varieties, like ice flavor, give you a cold. Sometimes, if you use it repeatedly, it causes cancer in the throat. The majority of the results are consistent with other researches showing that e-smoking can increase the risk of lung cancer and induce symptoms like nausea, vomiting, headaches, dizziness, choking, burn injuries, irritation of the upper respiratory tract, dry cough, and dry eyes and mucous membranes [42, 43]. Some of the participants in our study stated that e-cigarettes are more frequently smoked by younger individuals and their age range is between 20 to 35. Girls are extremely rare, while boys are more prevalent. Prior studies also showed consistent results, younger age groups are more likely to have ever used or are now using e-cigarettes [44]. Use of e-cigarettes is higher among boys but girls are increasingly at risk [45]. Some participants of this study also reported that children buy from the sidewalk because there are no restrictions there. However, there are few studies to compare these findings with therefore more extensive research is needed to bolster these conclusions. To guide future research on e-cigarette, use among teenagers and young adults and to inform policymakers and consumers about making evidence-based decisions, a thorough grasp of this literature is necessary [46]. Young individuals who use e-cigarettes run the danger of using cigarettes in the future. Since banning tobacco products has been shown to lower youth smoking rates, strict regulations pertaining to e-cigarettes are necessary for prevention [47]. Our findings revealed that e-cigarette importers usually import different types of vaping devices and juices from abroad. Similar findings were found, most of their e-cigarettes device and liquid come from abroad in Norway [48]. Our study respondents shared that Mirpur, Gulistan, Dhanmondi, Nikunja, Baridhara, Gulshan, Banani, Uttara, etc. are the major hotspot of e-cigarettes and some retailers’ sale replica of e-cigarettes in some place. To compare our findings there has not been found any previous study regarding this result. Our study revealed that e-cigarette distribution mostly occurs on online platforms such as Facebook and You Tube, this finding aligns with previous studies conducted in the United States. The majority of consumers had bought tobacco or e-cigarettes through online platforms, and both online and offline buyers noted that price and convenience had influenced their decision to buy tobacco or e-cigarettes from the online sites [49]. Furthermore, social media platforms serve as the main channel for e-cigarette distribution in Thailand [50]. Some participants in this study also highlighted that sometimes discounts are available, and many of the individuals who see the goods are aware of their value, which is why they purchase them. Moreover, addictive flavor and customer satisfaction are always in demand among customers, and if they can offer an outstanding flavor, it will work better to promote the e-cigarette brands. These findings are also consistent with a study [49] which found that there are four main reasons why people buy e-cigarettes online: price (cheaper online, discounts, buying in bulk); product characteristics (quality, availability); buying experience (time, convenience, reading reviews); and curiosity. In this study, regarding motivating the buyer’s approach to selling e-cigarettes, the retailers provide options to clients and greet them with courtesy upon arrival with a polite explanation, and customers attempting to quit smoking receive assistance in choosing juice. It also aligns with another study that found that individuals preferred to make purchases in person due to the opportunity to visually see, physically experience, and handle the goods, as well as receive guidance from store in person [49]. However, the quality of the liquid and device has a major impact on e-cigarette sales. The devices are only available to people who are aware of e-cigarettes; others who are not or do not buy them. The customers they serve do most of their marketing. The retail channel is the primary means of marketing cigarettes, as evidenced by a prior study that showed the bulk of cigarette companies’ advertising and promotional budgets were allocated for its distribution [51]. However, further extensive research is needed to address the lack of available literature on promotional statements regarding e-cigarette sales. Moreover, the majority of sellers, according to the report, do not provide written advertisements. When merchants disclose the product name and juice flavor, the majority of individuals who are aware of vaping use Google to find out more information regarding this and they also find reviews and videos on vaping on Facebook or YouTube. At the same time, vendors give some promotional speeches pleasantly related to the marketing of e-cigarettes. An earlier study showed that e-cigarette businesses’ marketing tactics have been linked to the rise in young users and video advertisements on digital platforms were found to be the most prevalent approach [52]. A previous study [53] also revealed that, using terms associated with the promotion of e-cigarettes, YouTube has been utilizing for this and consistent with this study. This study also found that retailers may boost e-cigarette sales by reducing their prices. When customers see advertisements, people tend to buy more products. This finding is in line with an earlier study that also found that sponsored events and social media advertising might be crucial parts of an effective e-cigarette marketing plan to boost e-cigarette sales [54]. Additionally, the offering of cash back incentives might serve as an effective strategy to enhance the sales of e-cigarettes. This study also made clear that every individual has a unique profit and sales volume, which vary based on where their stores are located In our study the majority of interviewees disclosed that they did not receive anything from the wholesalers or merchandizers; even if a device malfunctions, it is the vendors’ responsibility, and they are not even qualified for reimbursement. Since this was not included in the earlier research, a large-scale mixed-method study ought to be carried out to make this finding more generalizable. Nonetheless, the majority of vendors are happy with their businesses, and they want to launch new branches despite the high startup costs. They will also aid in its promotion if everything is in their favors. The uncertainty surrounding the government’s recent declaration regarding e-cigarettes is a cause for alarm, though. A previous survey also showed that a large number of states and towns have changed their smoke-free legislation to restrict public usage and ban the sale of e-cigarettes [55]. For instance, it appears that while they are happy with the sales of e-cigarettes, the prospect of a ban is a significant obstacle to their ability to operate their business sustainably. This study analyzed the potential future scenario of governments completely prohibiting e-cigarettes and found that sellers have no influence or control over this decision. They will conduct business elsewhere if the government outlaws it and they cannot contest the government’s judgments since they are final, even if it forbids them. Previous research indicated that electronic cigarettes (ECs) might pose a significant public health risk in the future for India, which is the world’s second-largest tobacco consumer with over 65% of its population under 35 years old. For now, it appears that outlawing ECs in India is the most practical course of action [56], and following example set by Punjab’s lead, other Indian states including Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Kerala also banned e-cigarettes. Additionally, countries such as Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam have already banned e-cigarettes [32]. Thus, resilient regulatory measures and an outright ban on e-cigarettes are required to avert future health concerns. The use of very effective marketing and promotion tactics has significantly increased the popularity of vaping and e-cigarettes. These efforts have attracted new consumers by offering innovative vaping products, causing substantial damage to the tobacco industry [57]. According to our study findings, there is a necessity of actionable laws and regulations regarding e-cigarettes in Bangladesh. In August 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a formal regulation asserting its jurisdiction over e-cigarettes. This regulation established a minimum age of 18 for purchasing e-cigarettes and introduced standardized requirements, including premarket approval applications, disclosure of harmful and potentially harmful ingredients, and the use of cautionary labels [32]. All web-based sellers of e-cigarettes have to be obliged to inform customers with clear precautionary information, at the very least in the form of wording that is visibly shown on the homepage. It ought to be against the law for them to use marketing strategies, such as complimentary samples, incentive schemes, and sales campaigns, etc. [26]. Additionally, we also found out that, our experts recommended strengthening licensing requirements, imposing age restrictions on purchases, stepping up awareness campaigns about the negative health consequences of e-cigarettes, and continuous license verification for e-cigarettes selling etc., in the perspective of Bangladesh. Similar findings was found to regulate e-cigarettes, its sale is prohibited in some number of nations and in some country there need license to sale those product [58]. Many nations have implemented rules regarding the import of e-cigarettes [58]. However, one of the biggest controversies about e-cigarettes is whether these gadgets are used for medicinal purposes or as recreational substances [59]. The biggest obstacle we confront is that many young people mistakenly believe that these products are healthier substitutes for traditional, smoke-filled cigarettes. For this reason, outlawing e-cigarettes is far more important than controlling them. Therefore, enacting laws that expedite the approval process, developing robust rules about the usage of e-cigarettes, and developing future regulatory mechanisms to solve obstacles to minimize the marketing of e-cigarettes could be several good approaches regarding this issue. Our study had some limitations. First of all, presenting compelling statistical data was difficult when employing the qualitative approach. Second, the interviewer occasionally felt uncomfortable responding to the questions since they were unaccustomed to delivering information using the qualitative approach, which occasionally made it difficult to determine the meaning in detail. In order to provide a universal appeal, large-scale researches that take into account the mixed-method design should be carried out to investigate this topic further. This study offers a comprehensive exploration of the e-cigarette landscape in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. It uncovers significant insights into production, distribution, marketing strategies, and health perceptions. The findings undergo the urgent need for regulatory interventions and create public awareness initiatives to address the complex challenges arising from the widespread availability and marketing of e-cigarettes, particularly among the youth population. E-cigarettes are being sold in various shops where people usually go for their necessary belongings like cosmetics, watches, sunglasses, confectionary items etc. and most alarmingly surrounded by academic institutions that are expanding. Moreover, these vaping devices are being imported into Bangladesh under different codes as well as other unrecognized ways from abroad. This exposure and accessibility encourage the younger generations to consume e-cigarettes. Customers purchase e-cigarettes through online and offline means and the sellers motivate them that these are less harmful options compared to the traditional ones. The study contributes valuable knowledge for informed policymaking and public health strategies to mitigate the potential long-term consequences of e-cigarette use in the context of Dhaka City. It emphasizes the importance of a coordinated and proactive approach to safeguard public health. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312802.s001 (XLSX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312802.s002 (XLSX) All those who participated actively in this study are gratefully acknowledged by the authors.

Fed cuts rates by 25 basis points On Thursday, the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points, or a quarter percentage point, bringing the target range to 4.50%-4.75%. At the Fed's news conference, chair Jerome Powell told reporters he would not resign if requested by Donald Trump, and that Trump does not have the power to fire or demote him. Momentum behind markets U.S. markets continued advancing on Thursday, propelled by postelection momentum. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index added 0.62%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index reversed gains to drop around 0.8% after the island's central bank reduced its interest rate by 25 basis points, in lockstep with the Fed's move. New fiscal stimulus expected from China China is expected to announce a new fiscal stimulus package when its parliament ends a five-day meeting on Friday. Analysts think the scale of support might be higher than initially planned because of Trump's threats of tariffs – that might go as high as 60% – on Chinese imports. Nissan's bad quarter Japanese automaker Nissan reported on Thursday that it made a net loss of 9.3 billion yen (around $62 million) during its fiscal second quarter. Operating profit, which is how much a company makes before taxes and other charges, plunged almost 85% year on year. Nissan also lowered its full-year outlook. Shares fell as much as 10% before recovering slightly. [PRO] Bitcoin might hit $100,000 Bitcoin surged to its highest price of more than $76,000 after Trump won the U.S election. Analysts think the cryptocurrency can climb further to reach the $100,000 milestone by the end of the year. Wednesday's postelection rally, during which the S&P popped 2.53%, was the best postelection move in the index's history, according to Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid, head of global economics and thematic research. Some of that momentum carried over to Thursday. The S&P continued its advance and gained 0.74%. Tech stocks, such as Apple, Meta Platforms and Nvidia, rose, helping the Nasdaq Composite climb 1.51% to close above 19,000 for the first time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, petered out. The 30-stock index traded around the flatline, weighed down by losses in financial stocks. "The market is signaling that a Trump administration would be good for growth and risk assets," said Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X ETFs, "but the combination of faster growth with new tariffs would be inflationary." If inflation resurfaces, the Fed's likely to stay its hand in lowering rates. That concern might be dampening investors' excitement in the stock market for now. Powell, in yesterday's press conference, maintained that "the election will have no effect on our policy decisions." Still, the Fed would be impacted by the decisions of the next administration. "Just in principle, it's possible that any administration's policies or policies put in place by Congress could have economic effects over time," he said. "Forecasts of those economic effects would be included in our models of the economy." Data from the CME FedWatch Tool suggests some prudence is filtering into the market. According to the futures market, just 30.4% of traders think the Fed will cut rates again in January. By contrast, 53% expect the Fed to keep rates steady. Those percentages are contingent on the central bank lowering rates to 4.25%-4.50% in December. Of course, that's all prognostication, and we know how inaccurate polls and bets can be. "By December, we'll have more data, I guess one more employer report, two more inflation reports and lots of other data," Powell said. The Fed prefers hard numbers. In markets, as in other aspects of our lives, that's probably good advice. — CNBC's Jeff Cox, Lisa Kailai Han, Hakyung Kim, Jesse Pound and Alex Harring contributed to this report. This story has been updated to clarify 53% of traders expect the Fed to keep interest rates steady in January, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Got a confidential news tip?

We’ve reached a new stage in the AI boom. Big Tech earnings — and the rest of the market — have been bolstered by the AI era. But now, Wall Street is expecting more than just promises. Are these companies set up for success? Or is it a pressure they can’t quite handle? This transcript was prepared by a transcription service. This version may not be in its final form and may be updated. Jeremy Owens: Hello, and welcome to On Watch by MarketWatch. I'm Jeremy Owens. It's been another busy week here at MarketWatch as we cover the election. While the Newsroom continues to dive into Donald Trump's win and what it means for the economy, we wanted to make sure you didn't miss some other very important numbers, Big Tech's earnings and AI promises. So today we're going to visit with Dan Gallagher, the Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street tech columnist. Plus, we'll tell you about other news we're watching this election week, including the Federal Reserve meeting and how all of it will impact your wallet. Last week, Microsoft executives finally answered Wall Street's big question, how much is the company actually making from generative AI? The company expects to surpass 10 billion in annual revenue from AI next quarter. That number might've pushed the stock higher three or six months ago, but after this report, the market had a scary Halloween. Microsoft's stock dropped 6%, pulling the S&P 500 into the red on the last day of October. That ended a five-month winning streak for the market. The problem? Microsoft's forecast was a little shy of Wall Street expectations for cloud growth, which just felt so 2022. And it wasn't just Microsoft. All the Big Tech stocks seemed to move less on their executives' AI promises and more on actual financial performance. So what happened in this round of earnings, and what does it mean for the future? To answer those questions, I brought in Dan Gallagher, who covers tech for the Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street column. Here's what he told me about what happened with Microsoft. Dan Gallagher: I think especially if you compare to this time last year when AI hype was just driving everything and these companies could raise the CapEx to (inaudible) levels and just blow money out the door, and get rewarded for it because investors saw all upside in the future and they realized obviously, nothing was going to happen that year. ChatGPT had just launched. So I think it's now like we're a year ahead, money is still going out the door in even more obscene amounts, and it's going to keep getting bigger next year. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, that $10 billion figure that Microsoft mentioned pales in comparison to what they're saying they're going to spend on capital expenditures on building out this AI infrastructure. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And to drill on that $10 billion number a little bit, we got to realize that okay, one, that's including a lot of stuff, things like OpenAI. OpenAI sends a lot of their compute to Microsoft. That helps the Azure number some. And especially with Microsoft, I think investors are starting to get a little bit more picky about what they want to see. In particular, there's a lot of questions about, is Copilot generating anything? Jeremy Owens: Yeah. And Copilot is the AI software they're selling, and we've talked about on this program before as the true test of this AI cycle hype. Obviously, we're seeing a lot of hardware sales and cloud computing sales go through, but it's that next lug, the software, is that going to sell? And that's why that's so important, is because Microsoft is out there in front of all these others, and if they can sell the software, it shows that maybe others can as well. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. And we don't really know how that's going for them yet. In terms of what Copilot specifically is bringing out, I think there's not so much skepticism on that 10 billion number, but it didn't really answer a lot of the questions that more on Wall Street actually have. There's different demands for AI. There's obviously these AI companies that are using cloud services right now because they need to train their models, a ton of compute there. But at the end of the day, the future of AI is going to be our businesses and consumers paying and paying extra for AI tools and AI services. So, Copilot is really central to that. Jeremy Owens: But it seems like companies now are willing to just put it in front of as many people as possible in their organization to see how they use it. At some point, they're going to have to look and say, "Well, how many people are actually using it?" For a lot of white-collar execs, it's like, "Oh good, we get a meeting transcript." Is that worth 30 bucks a month to the company for everybody to have access to those meeting transcripts? That's a big question moving forward. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And we've seen a term, it's a jargony term, but we call it rationalization. Rationalization is when you have a company that's looking at its spending on things like software and cloud services and thinks, okay, maybe we're spending a little too much here, we need to bring it back, or we need to match our spending with what we're actually using. We saw that with all the cloud services a couple years ago where they had a huge jump of growth in COVID, but after a couple years of that, there was this need to kind of, okay, not everything's being used. We need to bring our budgets in order. So I think we'll probably see those dynamics play out over the medium term with things Copilot. It'll all come down to, is there actual use happening on the ground? It's still too early I think to really see that on a mass scale, and I think one of the things that... It's going to test investors' patience, is that people change their work habits really slowly and reluctantly, even if a new tool comes along that says, "Oh, this is going to make it a lot easier." So I think that's another thing that investors have to factor in, is that to get the take-up, it's going to take time. Jeremy Owens: What Microsoft said about AI did not cause its stock to drop 6%. It really was about the forecast being just a tiny bit soft, and that's very standard. This goes back to where we were before all the AI hype. To me, it was like it's all about the forecast and your actual results, and nothing Microsoft said made me think 6% less of them. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. Microsoft historically, they're not aggressive with their forecasts, so I don't think I recall ever seeing them do what I would call a blowout forecast. Very conservative. I think you have to also factor in, last week's market was just a jittery market overall. I saw a lot of trades last week that seemed extreme up or down based on what the results were. We're not talking about Uber today, but Uber had a really big fall because they missed their gross bookings guide, but they've missed that a lot of times. So I think you have to factor that in a little bit to how the shares traded, but I do think we're definitely past the honeymoon phase of the AI hype and investors want to see more meat on the bone. Jeremy Owens: And we did get some of that meat. Amazon, while they didn't say the exact number, they did say they are on a multi-billion revenue run rate with AI, so a little bit more generic. We have to figure most of that is cloud. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. Amazon doesn't have really a strong, what we call a SaaS or an apps business like Office, Excel, all those Microsoft has, so a lot of their stuff is really under the hood stuff that companies are using. I think that's going to be honestly a harder thing for them to break out longer term, how much of that is being used by AI companies for compute versus other companies using AI-generated tools? It'll be interesting to see what they do with that longer term, because Amazon historically doesn't like to give a lot of specific breakouts. Think about all the years they've sold the Kindle reader. They've never made a quarterly disclosure of how many Kindles they sold, even way back when that was their first device and there was an interest in doing it. They just didn't do that. So I think with them, I don't see a line item coming. Jeremy Owens: What I take away from a lot of these reports, Dan, is that investors are now looking at these companies' core businesses again instead of focusing on general AI chatter. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And the funny thing with Amazon was that they got a bounce even though they did the biggest CapEx jump of any of the companies, and it was shocking actually to see the number they spent in the third quarter relative to what expectations were. There was a lot of interesting dynamics with them because in their last quarter, they had teased the fact that, because they're also doing the satellite program, these satellites to compete with Starlink that are going to provide web-based services, and hinted that they were going to start having launch costs work into it. And so there was this growing worry on Wall Street saying, "Well, street estimates for earnings are too high because nobody's factoring in these costs." And Amazon's profit margins are really key to the appeal because they've been going up and up and up the last few years, so I think the fact that their margins came in and stayed strong and their forecast for margins was really strong, which it generally is not, they usually give themselves a huge wiggle room there, that was enough to kind of boost them even past a huge CapEx jump. And even with a kind of fuzzy AI disclosure, it was good enough. Jeremy Owens: Yeah. And you bring up profit margins, the Big Tech's profit margins are driving the S&P 500's profit margins higher. Since the layoffs in late 2022, early '23, the Big Tech private margins have just gotten bigger, and we continue to see evidence of this. And you brought up in one of your articles about the earnings last week about Google, where they brought on, I think, 1700 new employees in the third quarter, which seems like a really big total until you look at Google's history. And they had averaged about 7,000 new employees for the third quarter over the past five years. And then hearing Google also say that 25% of its coding is now being done by AI. This just continues to hit for me that Big Tech is trying to put themselves together in a way that it shows their corporate customers what they can do. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And I think the timing works out well for them in that sense too. They lagged behind. We saw Meta do this big year of efficiency back in late '22, mostly '23, that they fired a lot of people, their revenue per employee went up, the stock really took off, and Google was lagging on that. They just didn't show any sign that they were going to do something that drastic. And so the fact that they have shown now that they're watching their cost, getting the efficiency help, maybe not with as drastic a number as Meta delivered, it's good for them. And then yeah, the timing with the fact that they have these AI tools now at a certain phase of development where they can be used like that is definitely, I think, going to help them. Jeremy Owens: But with Google, it is an advertising business. They actually do have enterprise, so they can make that pitch. Meta is the one, and I still call them Facebook, but Facebook also is a advertising company. Dan Gallagher: Even more so than Google. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, yeah, exactly. People want to talk about their social networks or whatever else they do, but these companies sell ads. That's how they make money. And both their ad businesses are going bonkers good right now. And Zuckerberg talks about the ad business, and obviously AI is helping their ads business, but I still don't understand what the business case is for all the AI spend he's doing. He promised to continue spending money on AI gear, and I just don't see where the money is for Facebook from AI besides better ad tools. Dan Gallagher: I think that's one big part of the appeal with it, especially when you consider that their core advertising business is now getting operating margins of like 50%-plus. Basically, right now, they're still in a phase where they can get away with a certain amount, because they show that they can do a pretty harsh turn. Let's go back to this Metaverse thing, the market brutally punished them when they said, "We're going to change our name and spend all this money to build a metaverse," and nobody understood what it was, and the market rebelled. And I'll give Zuckerberg a little credit here, he saw what happened and made a pretty hard pivot and said, "Okay, well, we're done with that." Not necessarily done, they still have- Jeremy Owens: No, he still doesn't say that. Dan Gallagher: They made a hard pivot in terms of the kind of things they were spending, the employee footprint they had. They made some pretty drastic changes quickly, which I think impressed a lot of investors. So I think they get a fair amount of benefit of the doubt right now. A year from now, if they're still spending this kind of amounts but the margin growth and everything has slowed, do they still get that or do they have more people asking exactly what you're asking, "What's the future upside of this?" It's probably not going to come from $300 glasses. Jeremy Owens: Right. Dan Gallagher: But if people took those up in a wide number and then got comfortable with things like AI and hardware, and started to be open to the fact of spending on services, there's potential there. Meta is not a company that's like, "We're going to be in the glasses business." For them, the glasses are a vehicle to get their technology into consumers' hands. Jeremy Owens: We're going to take a quick break. Coming up, can Apple find a generative AI payday, and what does all this mean for NVIDIA? Welcome back. Let's get into Apple earnings and the iPhone's AI debut. I think Wall Street is coming to the realization that AI is not a 2024 story. It's really a late 2025 story at best, at this point, and I think the best example of that is Apple. Apple brought out its Apple Intelligence last week. It actually released the program, which you need either this year's iPhone or last year's iPhone to access. And then they gave their earnings and forecast basically flat iPhone sales for this holiday season. It's basically admitting this is a late 2025 story if it actually does come around, and generative AI is a consumer product that makes consumers want to spend money. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. And I think even that's iffy at the moment, just given the fact that so far, AI-enabled devices have not proved big sellers. Consumers are not yet sold on this idea that they need a device with onboard AI capabilities like the iPhone, like the Samsung phone, like these PCs we're seeing. So I think for Apple, it's this Apple Intelligence launch, but not everything is going to be in it. So the stuff they showed off over the summer, that's slowly coming over the next year. So if you're a prospective iPhone buyer and your current device is working fine and you're thinking, well, maybe this AI thing's worth it, you're going to wait. Apple always has this base of fans that are anxious to get the new thing whenever it comes out, but more of them, especially at the price these phones are even without an AI surcharge, these are expensive phones. And historically, the things that have really sparked these super cycles are when there's a big hardware change, when the screen gets bigger, when they started the Pro models and had these much fancier cameras. You've seen things like that spike. And you also have the fact that people hold onto their phones longer, so if you've had a big uptick one year and those people hold on of their phone for let's say three years, four years, then you're going to have a naturally bigger uptick. But we haven't seen a lot of cases where software alone has sparked any kind of super cycle, and that was the "what if" coming into this, like even if Apple Intelligence was amazing, was that going to really drive people to do it? Jeremy Owens: I want to get to my general takeaways, and the first one's really easy and simple. NVIDIA is still fine. All these executives got on their earnings calls and said, "Hey, we're going to keep spending money for all this AI gear," and that was just music to Jensen Huang's ears. Dan Gallagher: Totally. If only Amazon had done their increase with the amount they increased, NVIDIA would be fine. Jeremy Owens: Right, right. Dan Gallagher: That was such a huge increase. But yes, they're all spending more. Jeremy Owens: Well, NVIDIA is going to replace Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, big move. NVIDIA coming into Intel shows the Dow trying to represent what is the market today. Dan Gallagher: The interesting risk with switching NVIDIA for Intel... Obviously Intel is greatly diminished, having a lot of trouble, like its days were numbered. That was clear. But when this conversation first came up earlier this year, I thought, well, there's some risks with NVIDIA, because technically, NVIDIA has multiple businesses because they were historically a video game chip company. Data center business grew up because companies were wanting those chips in their data centers. Well, it's pretty much all AI at the moment. Intel PCs were their dominant business, but it's not as dominant in Intel's model as it is in NVIDIA's. So in a way, NVIDIA is going to be always a little more of a volatile name because at some point when AI spending rationalizes and companies start to say, "Okay, well, we're going to not grow it as much," you're going to see NVIDIA stock may get really volatile, because right now, it just trades on this assumption that the spending's going up in a huge way. But it's going to be interesting to see how the effect plays out, especially in the years ahead as NVIDIA's business reaches like, what's maybe a new normal? How does the stock behave? I think it's going to go through some wild gyrations. Jeremy Owens: On the other side, and this was always something I thought about this technology but I'm just more baked in now that this is an enterprise technology and not really a consumer technology yet. And so that's good for Microsoft, Amazon and Google, which do sell enterprise generative AI products and cloud and software, while Meta and Apple are a little bit more questionable for me moving forward just on how they make money off of this. Dan Gallagher: I think so. But I think of Meta though not necessarily as consumer or enterprise, because remember, most of Meta's money is coming from businesses who are paying to advertise. So as long as they see value, and if generative AI makes Meta an even better advertising tool, they're going to be fine. For Apple, it's really tricky because if Apple's going to get AI into people's hands, it has to happen through their hardware. But the good news for NVIDIA, it doesn't matter what happens with Apple. Jeremy Owens: No, as long as Microsoft, Amazon, and Zuckerberg keep on spending- Dan Gallagher: Exactly. Jeremy Owens: ... they're fine. And so lastly, it feels like we've entered a new cycle in this AI hype era. It seemed like last year, all you had to do was say, "AI," your stock went up. This year, investors wanted numbers, and they've gotten a few more numbers or at least more specifics. And now we've reached this place where even a very specific big AI number for Microsoft did not help because everybody was looking at the traditional businesses. And it seems like a golden era for these Big Tech companies, to me. They've got good finances, they've got good core businesses, and they've still got this promise of AI returns in the future. And so they're sitting here, and I don't know how they go higher from here, but I also don't know how they get cut off at the knees, because they have that magic formula that Wall Street loves. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. So I think we're going to see this next year, is they're going to be fine on their core businesses. I think we're going to enter a phase where everything needs to go right. If you have an earnings report that's pretty strong on the core but the AI stuff isn't impressing, your stock's probably not going to do well, and the vice versa. You need to deliver both, because when you're spending this kind of money, you do need to show return at some point. They're not going broke, any of them, but this is a lot of money going out the door, and the questions are just going to keep growing and growing. Jeremy Owens: So enjoy this time now, Mark and Satya, and all you other executives who had such a good run this earnings season, because next year you're going to have to bring good core performance and AI evidence, and it still may not be enough. We'll see what the AI evidence shows- Dan Gallagher: Just do it all. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, yeah- Dan Gallagher: That's all you got to do- Jeremy Owens: Just do it all for us. Yeah, you're worth trillions of dollars. You got to show up for it. Well, Dan, thank you so much for what you do, and thank you so much for joining us here on On Watch. Dan Gallagher: Well, thanks for having me. Jeremy Owens: Before we go, it's time for what we are watching, a look at the news you need to know for the rest of the week and beyond. Tuesday's election went Republicans' way with Donald Trump winning the presidency and the GOP retaking the Senate. There are a lot of implications here for the economy and the market, from the effects of mass deportations to the likelihood of friendly rules for the cryptocurrency industry. We'll be back to discuss those issues and more in depth next week. The October jobs report came in last Friday and it was disappointing, with only 12,000 new jobs added. While that number was much lower than expected, it really shouldn't have been too surprising. Two hurricanes and a massive strike at Boeing dragged down a month that is typically big for hiring. Despite those underlying factors, the jobs report still reflects a labor market that is not strong. The Federal Reserve has certainly been discussing that jobs report in its meeting, which began yesterday and will run through today. The board is expected to cut another 25 basis points from its core interest rate and Chairman Jerome Powell will face the press today to discuss the decision. And that's it for this episode.
