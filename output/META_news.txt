On 9 June, at Apple Inc.’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), chief executive Tim Cook and his top brass unveiled a slew of updates, including a new ‘liquid glass’ design and enhancements to Apple Intelligence. But analysts, developers and investors were left underwhelmed. The announcements felt incremental, many of the features already exist in rival products. Some had hoped Apple would use the event to mount a dramatic AI comeback. That didn’t happen. Its shares slipped about 1.5% on the Nasdaq post-keynote. Apple’s troubles didn’t begin with WWDC. The event merely spotlighted its deeper struggle to keep pace with competitors. Its share price has dropped nearly 20% so far this year, the steepest decline among the five big tech firms, including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google. Read this | Apple opens its trillion-dollar app empire to AI devs at WWDC 2025—India stands to gain big That drop reflects a mix of investor concerns: sluggish iPhone sales; declining market share in China, one of its biggest markets; rising regulatory scrutiny of its high-margin services business; its faltering AI ambitions; and renewed criticism from US president Donald Trump over its global outsourcing amid tariff threats. In the past six years, about 52% of Apple’s revenue has come from the iPhone. But the device is in a rut. Growth has been flat for two years, dragging down overall revenue. In the December 2024 quarter, iPhone sales slipped 0.8% year-on-year. In the March quarter, they rose just 1.9%. Earlier growth in iPhones was driven by customers upgrading their phones. They are less willing to do that now. The China challengeChina has long been crucial to Apple—as a major consumer market and a manufacturing base. Today, it poses a twin threat. Apple’s deep integration with Chinese supply chains makes it hard to relocate production without disruption. This makes it vulnerable to tariff threats from the Trump administration. It is moving some production to India, but tariff-related risks remain.

The iPhone's share in the Chinese smartphone market fell to 15% in Q1 of 2025, against 21% in Q4 of 2023. Chinese brands such as Huawei and Xiaomi have gained share, a trend expected to continue. Only 21% of Chinese consumers would choose an iPhone for their next purchase, down from 29% a year ago, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence survey. Apple's position in the country is also complicated by the Chinese government's ban on foreign technology in some workplaces and broader geopolitical tensions.

Title: 6 Great Vanguard Index Funds For A Buy-And-Hold Portfolio
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/6-best-vanguard-index-funds-for-buy-hold-portfolio/
Time Published: 2025-06-14T15:00:00Z

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. A buy-and-hold portfolio built with Vanguard funds can be cost-efficient, diversified and ... More profitable. Trying to predict where the market’s headed amid geopolitical unrest and ever-changing tariff policies can be exhausting. Fortunately, you don't have to predict the future to make money investing. A diversified buy-and-hold portfolio plus a good dose of patience can help you reach your wealth goals without timing the market. Vanguard funds are good candidates for buy-and-hold portfolios because they cover popular market segments, and many have low expense ratios. Whether you want a simple two-fund portfolio or something more complex, one or more of the six funds on this list can provide the diversified exposure you need. The table below introduces six Vanguard funds for the buy-and-hold investor. The first two funds, VTI and VOO, provide overlapping exposure to domestic stocks. Most investors will choose one of them as a core, anchor position. The other four funds provide complementary exposure for a well-diversified portfolio. Some of these funds are also available as Vanguard mutual funds, which you may have access to in your 401(k). The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF represents the entire U.S. stock market, from small to large companies. The fund uses a sampling approach to replicate market returns. This helps keep costs lower versus owning every stock available. Even so, VTI holds more than 3,500 stocks and provides exposure to all economic sectors. VTI is an efficient pick for whole market exposure with its low expense ratio and low tracking error. Tracking error is the performance difference between the fund and its underlying index. VTI’s tracking error on a NAV basis has historically been one or two basis points. As a core stock holding, you could weight VTI as high as 90%—assuming you can handle risk and you’re not investing in other stock funds. More conservative investors would allocate 40% to 80% to VTI, depending on what else is in the portfolio. VTI's average annual return over the past 10 years is 12.14%. The fund does pay quarterly dividends with a 30-day SEC yield of 1.24%. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF invests in the S&P 500, which includes the largest and most successful U.S. public companies. This fund is a popular choice for novice and experienced investors. According to ETF Database, VOO is the largest U.S. ETF as measured by assets under management. Compared to VTI, VOO is more heavily concentrated on big tech stocks. You’d choose VOO as your core holding if you believe those mega-cap companies will continue their historic growth trajectories. In June 2024, a Morgan Stanley report noted that the Magnificent Seven stocks drove more than half of the S&P 500's 26.3% gain in 2023. Those stocks—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla—have been less dominant in 2025, but it's hard to count them out. VOO allocation guidelines are the same as VTI’s. Your exposure can range from 40% to 90%, depending on the rest of your portfolio and your risk tolerance. VOO has returned 12.81% annually on average over the past decade. The fund pays quarterly dividends, with a 30-day SEC yield of 1.24%. Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF invests in more than 800 domestic small-cap companies. Industrials and financials are the top sectors in the portfolio, followed by consumer discretionary and real estate. Small caps suit a buy-and-hold portfolio because they have good growth potential and some volatility. Longer holding periods smooth out the rough edges and average to positive returns. Small-cap returns have outperformed large caps in multi-year cycles, but not since 2011. Analysts from investment firm Wellington Management and Chartered Financial Analyst Daniel Fang believe small caps will take the lead again soon. An 8% to 10% small-cap allocation is an appropriate starting point for buy-and-hold investors. Remember to consider the small-cap exposure you already have in a total market fund like VTI. VBR has delivered an average annual return of 7.84% since May 2015. The fund pays quarterly dividends with a 30-day SEC yield of 2.1%. The Vanguard Total International Stock ETF invests in more than 8,000 foreign large-cap companies. The fund tracks the FTSE Global Call Cap ex US Index, which includes stocks from emerging and developed markets. Investing outside the U.S. can provide access to lower valuations and potentially higher growth potential. There can be more volatility, too, which underscores the importance of diversification and long holding periods. Buying and holding a broad international fund like VXUS checks both boxes. Charles Schwab recommends an international stock allocation of 5% to 40%, but many investors will opt for 10% to 20%. The David Swensen Portfolio uses a 15% allocation. Swensen formerly managed Yale University’s endowment fund, famously growing it from $1 billion to $31 billion. VXUS has produced an average annual return of 5.6% since May of 2015. The Vanguard Real Estate Fund offers growth and income potential through its real estate investment trusts (REIT) holdings. The fund tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 index. The index includes about 150 small, mid and large-cap REITs, and the top holding comprises less than 7% of the portfolio. REITs often pay high dividend yields because they distribute 90% of their income to shareholders. A related perk is that REITs do not pay corporate taxes on the distributed income. So REIT investors sidestep the double taxation that occurs with non-REIT companies—when profits are taxed at the corporate level and again with shareholder dividends. A REIT fund also provides access to the real estate market, which typically doesn’t move in lockstep with stocks. This provides a nice diversification benefit, alongside good returns. The FTSE Nareit All REIT index produced a pretax average annual return of 11.1% between 1972 and 2024, according to data provided by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (Nareit). A Morningstar analysis concludes that a portfolio with 51% stocks, 34% bonds and 15% REITs outperformed a 60-40 split between stocks and bonds more than half the time between 1976 and 2022. A typical REIT allocation would be 5% to 15%. VNQ pays quarterly distributions. The total distributions over the past 12 months were $3.63, which equates to a yield of about 4%. The Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF invests in investment-grade, intermediate-term U.S. bonds. Tax-exempt bonds and TIPS are excluded. Treasury bonds comprise nearly half of the portfolio, with government mortgage-backed securities and corporate bonds making up another 44%. Bonds provide income and relative price stability, two traits that complement stocks. Your allocation to this fund should depend on your risk tolerance. If you don’t like risk, opt for higher bond exposure—say, 50% of your portfolio. If you are comfortable with the volatile nature of stocks, your bond exposure could be as low as 10%. BND pays monthly distributions with a 30-day SEC yield of 4.47%. Bottom Line A buy-and-hold portfolio built with Vanguard funds can be cost-efficient, diversified and profitable. Start by setting target allocations for different asset types—from large caps to REITs and bonds—based on your risk tolerance. Then plug matching funds into your allocation formula and wait for your returns to build over time.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / JUNE 14 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world.

The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations.

Title: The Tech Job Meltdown

Full Content:
He wrote me a prescription; he said “You are depressedI'm glad you came to see me to get this off your chestCome back and see me later, next patient pleaseSend in another victim of industrial disease”Industrial Disease, Dire Straits Since the start of 2023, more than half-a-million tech workers have been laid off. This isn’t the impact of COVID, this isn’t a sudden realization that tech workers are under-performing, this isn’t (much) a wave of AI making tech workers more efficient, and the other usual shibboleths like “it was overhiring during the pandemic” or “it’s a wave of H1B workers” or “all knowledge worker jobs are being replaced by LLMs” are only vaguely correct. You could make a pretty reasonable case that it was the end of Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP) and the corresponding impact of cost of capital - that the cost of borrowing went up, thus venture capital became a less attractive investment class than other areas, so less money went to building new companies and it was harder for existing firms to borrow, as investors went elsewhere for better returns. That is correct - and it would have had its impact - though that impact would have basically been the slowdown of new venture backed firms, not layoffs at the Big Tech Giants - and that did in fact happen. (There is definitely a knock-on effect at the Big Tech Giants where a lack of tech startups does bad things to the large parts of the ecosystem - but that effect is not as immediate as it was back in in the 2000 dot com crash.) But there’s a much more immediate bottom line reason. Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code governs the tax treatment of research and development (R&D) expenditures. For roughly 70 years, American companies could deduct 100% of “qualified research and development spending” in the year they incurred the costs, and this was generally interpreted pretty liberally. Salaries, software, contractor payments… if it contributed to creating or improving a product, it could be deducted “off the top” of a firm’s taxable income. The deduction was originally codified by Section 174 of the IRS Code of 1954, and under the provision, R&D flourished in the U.S. It gave us the dominance of Bell Labs, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook - pretty much all the US technology booms you’ve lived through unless you’re quire venerable. So the way these regs are written: These expenditures must be for activities intended to discover information that eliminates uncertainty about the development or improvement of a product. (Kind of open-ended.) Prior to 2022, taxpayers could immediately deduct R&D expenditures in the year they were incurred, providing a significant tax benefit for businesses investing in innovation. Alternatively, taxpayers could capitalize these costs and amortize them over a period (e.g., at least 60 months) if they chose to defer the deduction. But it was pretty rare to do this, because you could directly manage your R&D payroll costs versus income to mitigate the tax hit. And societally, we accepted that - we were investing in growing the American economy. But, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 amended Section 174, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021. Starting in 2022, R&D expenditures must be capitalized and amortized over 5 years for domestic research (and 15 years for foreign research… which is pretty untenable.) This change eliminated the option to immediately deduct R&D costs, increasing tax liability for companies with significant research budgets in the short term. Even more annoying, amortization begins at the midpoint of the taxable year in which the expenses are incurred, using a straight-line method. The short version is: this rule change has increased taxable income for businesses in the short term, as they can no longer deduct R&D costs immediately. Now, there is actually a category of tax law which you can still use (IRS Section 41 Research and Development Tax Credits) which are different - if you think I’m about to advocate tax reform, yes, but I’m always doing that and I feel like I’m talking to a brick wall. But it’s not as broadly useful, and it’s not a simple recategorization, or we’d all have done it. Anyway, let me see if I can summarize how it works today. A U.S. company incurs $1 million in domestic R&D (Section 174) expenses in 2025 and let’s assume they can’t reasonably reclassify any of it under Section 41. Under Section 174, it must capitalize these costs and amortize them over 5 years. Amortization begins mid-year, so in 2025, the company can deduct $100,000 (1/10th of $1 million, since you only get to count half the first year. The remaining $900,000 is deducted evenly over the next 4.5 years ($200,000 per year). These are basically “tax credits”. So in some respects, they may be long term beneficial - but they are a short term drag, which is why you see layoffs at the moment. Also they create a lot more compliance paperwork (and potentially you’ll see companies change hands just for their accumulated tax credits, which is a little… unhelpful.) And of course, this hit the “real world” of companies focused on building tomorrow’s products in some pretty obvious ways. The inability to immediately deduct R&D costs reduced cash flow, particularly for cash-strapped startups and small tech firms reliant on R&D. Companies had to either take out high-interest loans - since of course, interest rates have recently gone up, cut costs, or face bankruptcy. Many chose layoffs to free up cash to cover these tax liabilities. For instance, a small company might lay off a software engineer earning $200,000 to cover a $189,000 tax bill. Now, you might think the 15-year amortization period for foreign R&E expenditures would make hiring non-U.S. engineers less tax-advantageous and help bring jobs back to the US, but this mostly did not actually work out this way. You see, larger companies responded by offshoring R&D to countries with more favorable tax regimes, leading to U.S. job losses. For example, Google reportedly shifted some work to Germany, and Microsoft moved a bunch of research work to China - both because pay rates were better and because the local subsidiary company in that jurisdiction operated under the national laws for that nation, which … were not the US tax laws. They were much more like the previous US tax laws, because the rest of the world had realized “hey, we also want to encourage people to invest in R&D and grow the next trillion dollar company here!” And this new tax ruling doesn’t precisely say “we don’t want to do that” but it does say “we don’t want you to be quick about it” - which everyone who believes in the Amazing Growth Story thinks is anathema to their strategy. Anyway, the impact of this tax strategy turned out to be: layoffs of U.S.-based engineers while companies restructured operations abroad. Now back in 2017, when Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the signature legislative achievement of President Donald Trump’s first term, it slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which looked like a massive revenue loss “on paper” for the federal government. So in order to make the 2017 bill comply with Senate budget rules, lawmakers had to offset the cost… therefore, they put in a future tax hike (well, several) that wouldn’t kick in right away, wouldn’t provoke immediate backlash from businesses, and could, in theory, be quietly repealed later. The delayed change to Section 174, from immediate expensing of R&D to “mandatory amortization”, meaning that companies must spread the deduction out in smaller chunks over five or even 15-year periods… that’s one of them, as I’m sure you’ve figured out. The delayyed start meant that it would not begin affecting the budget until 2022, but it helped the TCJA appear “deficit neutral” over the 10-year window used for legislative “scoring”. The delay wasn’t legally required, mind you, it was a way to game the system. These kind of political tactics are commononplace in tax legislation. Phase-ins and or delayed-start provisions let lawmakers game how the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) - Congress’ nonpartisan analyst of how bills impact budgets and deficits - “grades” legislation, because it kicks the costs down the road, outside the “official” forecasting windows. Those of you who play table-top games or RPGs would call this a way to “cheese the system” or the traditional euphemism used to be something along the lines of “robbing Peter to pay Paul”. Many businesses expected Congress to repeal or delay the Section 174 changes before they took effect in 2022, as there definitely was bipartisan support for immediate expensing. However, inaction led to a “shock” when 2022 tax bills arrived in 2023, forcing rapid cost-cutting, including layoffs. Small software firms, in particular, faced “extinction-level” tax bills, with some reporting taxable income tripling overnight, prompting layoffs or salary cuts. And bigger firms - Amazon, Meta/Facebook, Alphabet/Google, etc, Microsoft, Salesforce, etc - have had widespread layoffs in the US and have moved jobs overseas. Twilio cut 22% of its domestic workforce in 2023. Shopify cut 30% (they’re based in Canada, but much of their R&D was in the US - guess what, it isn’t anymore). Coinbase cut 36% of their team and there are still a heck of a lot of crypto bros, so I think they are probably not in a doomsday situation. Now, I don’t want to say this was the only thing in 2023 that did this. There was a lot of economic turmoil on the horizon then: rising interest rates, reduced venture capital funding, supply chain problems, and post-pandemic over-hiring corrections, all amplifying financial pressures at the time. Companies like Meta announced layoffs during their “Year of Efficiency” in 2023, partly due to these tax changes and corresponding changes in ad spending. While not the sole cause, the Section 174 change drove (or accelerated) layoffs that otherwise would probably have been unnecessary. Congress has made noise previously about a bipartisan reversal of this tax code change, and I rather hope they do - it would be a welcome boost to many sectors of the American economy, from manufacturing to pharmaceutical to technology to education to electrnics to scientific research and consulting. Don’t think of this as just a problem for the tech space. I mean, the tech sector is ridiculously dominant for the S&P 500, the “Magnificent Seven” are a third of the value of the S&P 500. (That’s Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, and Tesla.) But if this does get repealed - it will be very good for those seven stocks - this is not an official stock tip, shush, you SEC guys. Throughout the 2010s, a broad swath of startups, direct-to-consumer brands, and internet-first firms… heck, basically every company that you would recognize from Instagram or Facebook ads… built their growth models around a kind of synthetic carefully engineered break-even. Lot of online firms, a lot of handheld or wearable tech firms, personal entertainment devices, ride-hailing firms, anything self-driving, all the recent buzzy things. The tax code allowed them to spend aggressively on product and engineering, then write it all off as R&D, keeping their taxable income close to zero by design. It worked because taxable income and actual cash flow were often not quite the same thing under what’s known as GAAP accounting practices. Basically, as long as spending counted as R&D, companies could report losses to investors while owing almost nothing to the IRS. In short, it costs a lot to invent - and market - the future. Building a better tomorrow can be expensive! Investors generally bought into this, gave them another round of venture capital, and let them defer a public offering. (This is actually another problem with this model - companies have stayed private far too long - but I’ll address that at some other point.) But the Section 174 tax change absolutely cratered that model. Once those same expenses had to be spread out, or amortized, over multiple years, suddenly you couldn’t write these off - basically, the tax shield vanished or the accounting rules changed, depending on how politely you want to phrase it. But the mechanics of it are the same: companies that were still burning cash suddenly looked profitable on paper, triggering real tax bills on imaginary gains. (If this reminds you of some of the past economic crises - it should - this is one of the things that burned people back in the dotcom crash of 2000 amongst other mark-to-market problems in 2008, though the 2008 crisis mostly wasn’t this.) The logic that once fueled a generation of digital-first research-focused growth ran straight into a IRS-shaped brick wall and put a mighty dent in the work force. If you were already public and profitable - well, your management team wasn’t going let you suddenly become unprofitable just because of a tax law change, so the answer was “cut expenses” and that mostly became “slow CapEx on data centers - servers are expensive - and lay off employees” so as to preserve profit margins and keep the stock price high. After all, reasoned management, if we had to put up with these crazy new rules, we basically just had to bank up R&D credits for a few years and then we were back to par. It was a couple of years of drag on the economy - and a particularly bad time to fall behind on technology leadership or a chance to reshore manufacturing or stabilize the American economy. One suspects that the current administration, if they had noticed that, might have kicked out a repeal or other clever plan as part of their new budget package (what’s currently being bundled together under the slightly goofy name of the Big Beautiful Bill) to juice economic recovery. So it wasn’t just tech experiencing effects. From 1954 until 2022, the U.S. tax code had encouraged businesses of all stripes to behave at least a little bit like we think of tech companies behaving, by which I mean “investing in R&D” and more generally “investing in software” for the latter half of that. From retail to logistics, healthcare to media, if firms built internal tools, customized a software stack, or invested in business intelligence and data-driven product development, they could expense those costs - and the IRS generally agreed, which is slightly miraculous. The write-off incentivized in-house builds and fast growth well outside what people generally call the “tech sector”. For comparison, check the OECD research showing that immediate deductions foster innovation more than spread-out ones. And American companies loved that logic and invested according to it. According to government data, U.S. businesses reported about $500 billion in R&D expenditures in 2019 alone, and almost half of that came from industries outside traditional tech. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that this sector, the broader digital economy, accounts for another 10% of GDP. Probably 20% if you count Big Tech. And there’s a secondary market - all the people who support and are downstream from those workers and those industries (see below); we’re actually introducing relatively-avoidable friction into about a quarter of the American economy here with this particular tax change. The result? A tax policy aimed at raising short-term revenue basically defined the growth engine for a huge chunk of American companies. But when that rug got pulled out, it also yanked out the incentive for hiring American engineers or investing in American-made tech and digital products. It made building tech companies in America suddenly not economically viable, and the last time we did this with a stupid policy change (Fed policy tightening “to defeat the Wealth Effect” and cool down speculative fervor … yup, it sure did! Lots of wealth went away, was that a good idea?) caused the big Dot Com Crash in 2000. It would probably be a good idea to put this tax credit back in place (or some facsimile thereof) before it continues to strip jobs out of the American economy - let alone all the folks (realtors, contractors, restaurants, nannies, tutors, personal trainers, et al) that are one step downstream from the tech sector jobs. Thanks for reading! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. This entire tech-layoff wave is about more than AI or plummeting demand. It’s the delayed bomb Congress planted in Section 174 (a stealth tax that reclassified every developer’s salary as R&D amortized over years, not the quick write-off it used to be). People inside big firms are collateral damage in a tax strategy. The policy also shoved engineers’ families onto the payroll chopping block. Until lawmakers reverse course, U.S. tech is bleeding talent - nail in coffin for innovation here while other countries scoop up the scraps. This needs to be shouted from every rooftop. Everyone needs to write, call, and email their representatives and senators to address this issue. No posts Ready for more?

Title: XRP Rocket Flight In View As Circle’s USDC Stablecoin Goes Live On XRPL

Stablecoin issuer Circle is strengthening ties with Ripple by launching its U.S. dollar-pegged USDC stablecoin on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Following the launch of USDC on the XRPL, market participants’ anticipation of a strong XRP price rally is heightened. According to the June 12 announcement, developers and institutions will now be able to easily mint and redeem USDC tokens on the XRP Ledger following the unexpected integration. The integration makes it easy to access USDC liquidity and benefit from the XRPL’s fast and secure network. USDC is currently the industry’s second-largest stablecoin with a market cap of $61 billion, trailing only Tether’s USDT. This latest development marks another milestone in USDC’s expansion across multiple blockchains, bringing its coverage to 22 chains, including Solana, Ethereum, and recently, Sam Altman’s World Chain. Notably, Ripple also joined the stablecoin gold rush, with the rollout of its own highly regulated RLUSD stablecoin last December. The token, which rivals USDC and USDT, currently has a paltry market cap of $412 million. USDC issuer Circle made its trading debut on the New York Stock Exchange last week, but nothing could have braced Wall Street for the company’s dynamite initial public offering (IPO). The IPO, which raised $1.1 billion for the firm and early shareholders, surpassed the initial performance of major publicly traded tech companies such as Meta, Robinhood, and Airbnb upon their respective listings. Crypto commentators pointed to the market’s fundamental belief that the GENIUS Act — the landmark U.S. stablecoin legislation — will pass as a key driver for the success of Circle’s IPO. Before the IPO, it was rumored that Ripple had attempted to acquire Circle for at least $5 billion, but the bid was rejected as too low.

Compared to other Nintendo consoles, the Switch 2 is an outlier. It's the first Nintendo system that feels like a direct, no-frills upgrade to its predecessor. It looks similar, it doesn't require new controllers, and it even plays 99% of the original Switch's library. It's a sequel, which is rare for such an innovation-focused company. This lack of innovation gives the Switch 2 its greatest strengths and worst flaws. On the one hand, the system carries over everything I loved about the original console, including its massive library and iconic blend of handheld and TV gaming. But on the other hand, it offers what ultimately amounts to a similar gaming experience at jacked-up prices. I've spent more than a week with the Nintendo Switch 2, playing a variety of games every day. Although I consider it a no-brainer purchase for players who never bought a Switch, I'm not convinced it's worth upgrading from the original. At least, not yet. I'm confident the Switch 2 will eventually become an even better console than the Switch 1, but it needs more exclusive games to get there. See also: Nintendo Switch 2 vs. Nintendo Switch 1 Like the original Switch, the Nintendo Switch 2 can be used as a handheld gaming system or connected to your TV at home. This new model has more powerful hardware and supports 4K resolution, HDR, and 120 FPS gaming. Specifics Like the original Switch, the Switch 2 is a handheld system that can also be placed in a dock to use with a TV at home. The Switch 2's built-in screen is nearly two inches bigger than the original console's, and when combined with a higher resolution — up to 1080p from the original's 720p — the comparison is night and day. Small details are easier to see, and tiny text takes less time to decipher. However, this is an LCD screen rather than an OLED one. Nintendo released an OLED version of the original Switch in 2021, and this type of screen offers higher contrast. That said, this new display's colors are still noticeably more vibrant than the standard Switch's LCD. The improved image quality is in part due to the screen's support for high dynamic range (HDR), a feature that the Switch 1 didn't have. HDR enables enhanced contrast and a wider range of colors. Though the Switch 2's backlight isn't bright or precise enough to showcase the full impact of what HDR can do, it still benefits from this feature. You can learn more in our HDR guide. I'm excited to see more games take advantage of the console's 120Hz refresh rate (up from 60Hz on the original Switch) and the dock's 4K output for Ultra HD gaming on a 4K TV. The higher refresh rate can provide smoother motion, while the higher resolution offers a sharper, more detailed picture. There's only one game released so far that goes up to 120 FPS, the "Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour" tech demo, and it does indeed look very smooth. The creatively named Joy-Con 2 controllers are a mixed bag. They're larger than the original controllers, making them feel less cramped in your hands. They also connect to the Switch 2 magnetically, which is more convenient than the original's physical rails, albeit a bit flimsier feeling. It's a worthwhile tradeoff. But for whatever reason, Nintendo built them with the same problematic joystick parts that caused the infamous "Joy-Con Drift" issue on the original system. This flaw is a ticking time bomb that'll crop up more frequently as time goes on, so keep an eye on your controllers for symptoms. Each Joy-Con 2 can also be used as an optical mouse, but few games take advantage of this feature so far. When I used it, the mouse sensors were accurate and responsive, but the controller felt a bit too thin to handle as comfortably as a real mouse. Where the Nintendo Switch 2 truly shines is in its performance, and not just with Switch 2 games. Like its predecessor, the Switch 2 runs on a custom-made Nvidia chip. It's hard to compare the chip to any other system like-for-like, but most hardware breakdowns describe the Switch 2 as a mobile PlayStation 4. That might not sound like much, but it's a big improvement over the original Switch's underpowered hardware and opens the door to a wide variety of big-budget AAA titles. Graphically intensive games, like "Cyberpunk 2077," which were impossible to run on an original Switch, are now available on the Switch 2. "Cyberpunk 2077" still doesn't run perfectly, but it's more than playable. The most shocking aspect of the Switch 2's performance is how it improves games made for the original console: The load times in "Splatoon 3" and "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom" have shrunk to only a few seconds. Fast travel in "Pokémon Sword" is near-instantaneous, and the normally lag-filled "Pokémon Scarlet" runs at a smooth 60 FPS. Some "Super Smash Bros. Ultimate" matches start before the game can even show which characters are fighting. The Switch 2 has become the ultimate way to experience original Switch games, even if they don't have a dedicated "Switch 2 Edition" update. If you don't own the original console and you've been wanting to play these games, this makes the Switch 2 an obvious buy. This improved performance does come with downsides, though. Most notable is the reduced battery life, which is down to an estimated two to 6.5 hours from the original's 4.5 to nine. Both also take more than five minutes to turn on after being plugged in to charge, which is a major blow to the console's portability. I ran a test comparing the Switch 2 to my 2018 original model, seeing how long they could last running "Tears of the Kingdom" in a busy in-game area with the camera endlessly spinning. The brand-new Switch 2 lasted about two hours and fifty minutes, while I logged about two hours and thirty-five minutes on my original Switch. Though the Switch 2 did last slightly longer in this test, it's important to note that my original system has a seven-year-old, heavily used battery. With that in mind, the comparison is disappointing. As of this writing, the Switch 2 only has two exclusive Nintendo games: "Mario Kart World" and "Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour." They're leagues apart in quality. "Mario Kart World" is the best game in the series so far. The most fun part of any "Mario Kart" race is the chaotic first few seconds when everyone is jockeying for an early lead, and the new Knockout Tour mode, which turns the race into a battle royale, makes that chaos last the entire match. There's no such thing as a comfortable lead — you're always in danger of getting bumped to the bottom of the pack. It also boasts a wonderfully diverse set of characters, most of whom have multiple unlockable costumes or forms; an updated trick system that lets you ride on walls and charge boosts at any time; and some incredible tracks, including a beautiful new version of Rainbow Road that's both the longest course in series history, and feels more like a shared boss battle than a racetrack. The graphics are crisp, and load times are short. It's also got a banger soundtrack that references and remixes songs from throughout the "Mario" franchise. But is it worth buying a Switch 2 for? By itself, I wouldn't say so. For all its new features, the basics of "Mario Kart" haven't changed, and I don't expect the original Switch's "Mario Kart 8" multiplayer servers to empty out anytime soon. Wait for more exclusives — and, hopefully, for "Mario Kart World" to go on sale. "Nintendo Switch Welcome Tour," meanwhile, presents itself as a quirky way to learn more about your system, but in reality, it's more of a chore than a fun instruction manual. To progress from area to area, you need to collect stamps, which are gathered by running up to each of the Switch 2's individual buttons/ports and pressing "A" to open a pop-up that tells you what they're called. There's no indication of which stamps you're missing, which leads to situations where you're sprinting around a giant Joy-Con, desperately checking every corner to figure out what buttons you missed. The mini-games are amusing but one-note, and the quizzes, which require you to read dozens of pages of explanations on how the Switch 2 was built and works, are boring. If "Welcome Tour" was a free pack-in with the system, none of this would be much of an issue, but it costs $10. My advice? Just watch a playthrough on YouTube. GameChat is the Switch 2's voice and video-chatting app. It's free until 2026, at which point you'll need a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pass membership to use it. Nintendo has hyped it up as one of the console's biggest selling points. Going in, I was pretty negative on GameChat. I figured it'd be like Nintendo's past attempts at online chat: Clunky and unintuitive. I also thought it'd pale in comparison to a free service like Discord. I'm happy to say that I was wrong! Setting up a GameChat session with my friend took only a few seconds, although waiting for them to actually connect once they accept the invite takes some time. The choppy screen sharing looks bad at first, but in practice, really wasn't noticeable. And the system's built-in microphone has some shockingly good noise cancellation. Even when I ran a hair dryer at full blast only a few feet away, my friend couldn't hear it, but made out my voice perfectly. GameChat isn't as feature-rich as Discord, but it doesn't need to be. It's made for quick, casual multiplayer sessions, not long-term communication. I expect it'll also be popular with kids, since it's encased in its own ecosystem, making it safer than a random Discord server. I didn't have a compatible webcam to test out the video-chatting function, but testing from The Verge has found mixed results when connecting third-party webcams. There doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason to which cams work and which don't. But when they do work, video evidence from other players shows that the feeds are pretty smooth. Now, the elephant in the room: The Switch 2 costs $450, which is $100 more than the Switch OLED, $150 more than the standard Switch, and comparable to both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles. It's also $100 more expensive than the cheapest Steam Deck, which is the most popular non-Nintendo handheld gaming system. The Switch 2's price isn't unreasonable compared to its competitors from rival brands. But this high cost makes it the most expensive Nintendo console yet, and it might mean that Nintendo's reign as the choice for gamers on a budget is ending. The price of games is getting higher, too. "Mario Kart World" costs $80, and that's not going to be a rare occurrence. Add in the cost of a Nintendo Switch Online subscription ($20 to $50 a year, depending on your plan), and the budget starts to get frighteningly tight. And that's before you consider buying any Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, like microSD Express cards, screen protectors, cases, controllers, and cameras. Obviously, everyone has a different financial situation. But at a time when prices are rising across the board, it's hard to justify spending so much on a relatively incremental upgrade of a console. If you already own a Nintendo Switch, then no, the Switch 2 isn't worth it just yet. The system doesn't have enough exclusive games right now, so most of your library will be titles you could have played already without spending more money. And because there aren't many exclusives that take advantage of the system's new graphical features, the Switch 2's 120 FPS and 4K resolution upgrades aren't that important. And while the new design is fantastic, it's not worth $450. The system simply hasn't justified its price. But if you never hopped on the Switch train, now's a great time to buy your ticket. That is, if you can find one in stock. Buying a Switch 2 gives you immediate access to a massive library of games, including original Switch classics like "Super Mario Odyssey," new experiences like "Mario Kart World," and remastered ports like "Street Fighter 6." There are also loads of new games coming in the next year, including the open-world RPG "Pokémon Legends: Z-A" and the highly anticipated first-person adventure "Metroid Prime 4." All this is to say that, yes, the Nintendo Switch 2 is a great console. And a year or two from now, it might just be the best product Nintendo has ever released. But right now, it's an inessential upgrade. It's the best choice for new players who never bought an original Switch, but overpriced for existing Switch owners.

Title: The World’s Largest Meatpacker Jumps On First Day Of NYSE Trading

ByChloe Sorvino ByChloe Sorvino, Forbes Staff. In the first hours since the world’s largest meatpacker began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday under the ticker JBS, the stock had a slow start before ending the day up nearly 5%. The addition of American investors has been expected to help the Brazilian conglomerate with $77 billion in 2024 revenue from processing and selling beef, pork, chicken and lamb to more than 100 countries. During the first day of trading, shares rose around 3% before briefly falling past where the stock opened at $13.65 per share at around 2:30 p.m eastern. As of the close of markets, the stock was back up and hit a high $14.29, or around 5% up. The market capitalization of JBS was more than $31 billion. And the billionaire sons of the founder, who guided the expansion of JBS beyond Brazil—and went to jail seven years ago after its American acquisition spree got ensnared in a massive corruption scandal involving 1,800 politicians in in their homeland—are now richer for it. As JBS stock rose, the net worths of Joesley and Wesley Batista increased an estimated $200 million each. The brothers, who are the top shareholders in the company and serve as board directors, are now worth $4.8 billion each. Together, through family holding companies, they own nearly 50% of JBS. Billionaires Wesley (left) and Joesley Batista are the top shareholders of JBS, the world's largest meatpacker, which began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. Joesley and Wesley Batista, 53 and 52 respectively, were personally charged with foreign corruption in the U.S. as well as insider trading allegations in Brazil (related to the timing of the news of their bribery scheme) that saw them briefly jailed in Brazil for about six months from 2017 to 2018. In all, the Batistas and one of their holding companies agreed to more than three dozen incidents of bribery in Brazil, according to their 2017 cooperation agreements with the Brazilian government. And the U.S. Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission found evidence of some $150 million in kickback when the Batistas and their holding company, J&F Investimentos, pled guilty to U.S. foreign corruption charges in 2020. J&F paid a $128 million criminal fine as part of a settlement with the Department of Justice. J&F also paid $27 million over foreign corruption charges with the SEC. At the same time, the Batista brothers, who are Brazilian citizens, settled a civil penalty with the SEC and paid $550,000 each. Until 2025, there had been a bipartisan effort to stop the U.S. listing on the NYSE. Last year, 15 senators—including Republicans Josh Hawley of Missouri and John Barrasso of Wyoming as well as Democrats Cory Booker of New Jersey, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts—denounced a potential IPO. Years prior, former Florida Senator Marco Rubio, now Secretary of State, was one of JBS’ loudest critics and twice requested a broad investigation by the Treasury Department into the Batistas and their assets. The long-delayed SEC approval for JBS’ dual-listing came just two days after the Trump Administration’s new SEC chairman was sworn into office. The SEC approval also came two days after it was revealed in a public filing with the federal election commission that the largest donor to the Trump Inaugural Committee was the JBS subsidiary, chicken processor Pilgrim’s Pride. The $5 million donation to Trump’s Inauguration was five times larger than the checks given by Amazon, Meta, Uber, Nvidia and Microsoft, which each gave $1 million. A JBS spokesperson has denied any link in the timing of the donation. The Trump Administration did not return request for comment. Allowing JBS to trade in the U.S. is likely bad news for America’s homegrown—and largest overall—meatpacker, Tyson. With a market capitalization of just under $20 billion, Tyson is slightly bigger than JBS in beef and chicken, but its stock price has been struggling, down 8%, in the past three months. Tyson has historically traded at around double the multiple of JBS, but analysts expect the addition of JBS to an American stock exchange to change that, which means JBS will have more buying power, and the competition is on. “Food is a national security issue,” says Carlos Laboy, the lead analyst on JBS at HSBC. “It benefits the United States to have the largest protein company in the world not only operated in the U.S. but listed in the U.S. and with the oversight of U.S. regulators. The alternative scenarios are not favorable to the U.S.”

Title: Meta Invests $14.3 Billion in Scale AI as Zuckerberg Builds New Artificial Intelligence Team

Scale CEO and co-founder Alexandr Wang will lead Meta’s new “Superintelligence” division following the deal Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said earlier this year that his company will be investing heavily in artificial intelligence in 2025. And on Thursday, he put his money where his mouth is, with the parent company of Facebook and Instagram investing $14.3 billion in Scale AI, a company that offers a platform and training data for developing AI models. The investment values Scale AI at more than $29 billion, the San Francisco-based company said in a blog post. As part of the deal, 28-year-old Alexandr Wang, Scale’s chief executive and co-founder, will join Meta to spearhead its new AI research division now dubbed the “Superintelligence” lab. Meta’s stock was down 0.77% on Friday, the morning after the deal was officially announced, to $688 per share. The company’s stock price is up about 15% since the start of the year. The tech giant’s stake in Scale AI — its second-largest deal ever, after the $19 billion it spent to buy WhatsApp in 2014 — reinforces Zuckerberg’s claim that AI is a key focus for Meta moving forward. Zuckerberg in January said Meta would spend between $60 billion and $65 billion to “significantly” expand its AI team; the company then updated that projection during its first quarter earnings call in April, saying it planned on spending up to $72 billion this year on AI. “This will be a defining year for AI,” Zuckerberg said in January. “I expect Meta AI will be the leading assistant serving more than 1 billion people, Llama 4 will become the leading state of the art model, and we’ll build an AI engineer that will start contributing increasing amounts of code to our research and development efforts.” The new superintelligence division will be separate from Reality Labs, Meta’s division that has been focused on virtual reality, augmented reality and AI. That division has stood out as one sector where Meta is spending more than it is making; the company reported it lost $4.21 billion on Reality Labs during the first quarter, while Meta overall reported $42.31 billion in sales.

Title: The Prototype: Space Company Voyager’s Stock Soars On IPO

ByAlex Knapp ByAlex Knapp, Forbes Staff. In this week’s edition of The Prototype, we look at a big space stock IPO, Korea’s plan to dominate the world of robots, building electric motors without metal and more. You can sign up to get The Prototype in your inbox here. Dylan Taylor, chairman and CEO of Voyager Technologies Inc. Space company Voyager Technologies brought in nearly $383 million in its IPO on Wednesday, with shares priced at $31. The company offers a number of different space services for both governments and commercial customers, including services on board the International Space Station. Its stock price soared upon the opening of trading, hitting a sky-high $63.88 at one point on Wednesday. It’s since come back down to Earth a bit, closing at $49.70 yesterday, giving it a market cap of over $2.7 billion. The company plans to use the increased capital to expand a number of its offerings, particularly Starlab, a private space station the company is developing for use after the International Space Station is decommissioned. Investors hope this success might lead to more IPOs in the space sector this year. P.S. - Quick housekeeping note: There will be no edition of the Prototype next week, as I will be off for the holiday. See you all back here on the 27th! Joe Buglewicz/AP In 2021 Hyundai Motor Company paid $1.1 billion to acquire 80% of robotics pioneer Boston Dynamics, famous for videos of its dog-shaped bot named Spot and its running and jumping humanoid Atlas. The deal initially seemed more of a headline grab for Hyundai rather than part of a fully baked strategy. That’s no longer the case. Four years later, Hyundai now represents the tip of the spear in Korea Inc.’s thrust into robotics. The company has continued to develop Spot, especially for use as a roving site inspector, and is also iterating on Atlas, with the intention of selling mass-produced humanoids controlled by AI as soon as 2028. Hyundai’s robotics lab has already deployed its X-ble platform of wearable robotic exoskeletons for use in factories. X-ble Shoulder, launched late last year after trials with 300 workers, is said to reduce shoulder and deltoid muscle exertions by more than 30% when lifting heavy objects like car parts. Its X-ble MEX is a more complicated rehabilitation suit that can help people walk again. Incredibly, these X-ble exoskeletons don’t require an outside power source, instead using passive spring-torque mechanics. Industrial robots are nothing new to Korea, which already leads the world in density of robot deployment, with 1,000 bots per 10,000 factory workers, compared to about 300 in the U.S. and 470 in China. But now its industries and government see a massive opportunity for robots outside the factory. A new public-private partnership, the K-Humanoid Alliance, aims to offer a commercially viable bipedal bot by 2028 that weighs less than 130 pounds, can lift 40 pounds, walk about 3 yards per second and can move with the flexibility enabled by more than 50 joints. The K-Humanoid Alliance also seeks to develop a common AI “brain” that all Korean robots can use. Read the whole story at Forbes. A team at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology has invented an electric motor that doesn’t use any metal. Instead, its main electric components are made from carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which are lighter than metals but just as electrically conductive. Use of this material has been proposed in the past, but has been hampered by the fact that making CNTs involves metals, and the residue left behind ends up degrading electrical performance. The researchers figured out a way to remove those metal particles with a chemical process that didn’t disrupt the CNT’s structure. The European Space Agency's Solar Orbiter spacecraft has sent back the first clear images of the sun’s south pole. The unique views of the sun were captured on March 16-17, when the Solar Orbiter was orbiting the sun from 15 degrees below the solar equator, enabling this first look. The spacecraft’s three cameras provide images of the sun in visible light, ultraviolet light, and light emanating from different temperatures of charged gas above the sun’s surface, revealing distinct layers of the sun’s atmosphere. In my other newsletter, InnovationRx, Amy Feldman and I wrote about RFK Jr.’s vaccine advisory committee purge, a tech billionaire’s funding of research on AI and healthcare, FDA approval of a new medicine that prevents RSV in infants and digital health company Omada’s IPO. On the Forbes YouTube channel, I spoke with my colleague Brittany Lewis about the potential science impacts of the Trump Administration’s proposed budget cuts to NASA as well as the potential consequences of HHS Secretary Kennedy firing all members of a key vaccine advisory committee. Researchers developed a new kind of paint that can passively cool buildings. It does this in two ways. First, its color reflects sunlight, which is a well-known technique. But it also incorporates nanoparticles that make the paint more porous, so that it captures more water when it’s wet. When that water evaporates, it cools down the building, working the same way sweat does to cool down your body. NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope took new photos of Uranus, giving scientists new insights about the seventh planet. One surprise: Its magnetic field doesn’t interact with its moons. IBM is aiming to have the first practical quantum computer built by 2028. It will comprise modular units each containing quantum chipsets, and the company says it has figured out scalable error correction, one of the major issues holding quantum computing back. Satellite company Kymeta developed a single antenna that can communicate across multiple satellite frequency bands. Until now, a satellite had to be outfitted with multiple antennas to do this, so this could lay a foundation for more seamless satellite communications. A gene therapy for hemophilia is still safe and effective, over a decade after it is first administered. A new study found that 10 patients who received it between 2010 and 2012 still showed the benefits of their one-time treatment, with few side effects. An analysis of over 3,500 companies across Europe over a span of 20 years found that firms that are newly-listed on the stock market will see a quick boost of profit compared to private companies that abandon their plans to IPO. The researchers also found that those companies see an increase in sales per employee and greater market expansion following going public as well. “Going public may unlock growth potential, provided market conditions are favourable,” researcher Francisco Urzua said in a press release about the study. The great rock musician Brian Wilson passed away earlier this week at the age of 82. To commemorate his legacy, Rolling Stone enshrined 25 of his essential songs, and I can’t quibble with any of their picks. My own personal top five: “God Only Knows”, “I Just Wasn’t Made For These Times”, “Good Vibrations”, “Wouldn’t It Be Nice?” and the utterly transcendent “Love And Mercy.” He may be gone now, but he’s left behind an incredible catalog of music.

Title: Forbes Daily: Israel Strikes Iran As Trump Pushes For A Nuclear Deal

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. President Donald Trump has touted his $5 million “Gold Card” visa as a way to raise trillions of dollars for the U.S. But a new website launching the initiative doesn’t look or feel like a legitimate government site, experts say. Among the red flags are the URL itself, unexpected links to the Department of Commerce rather than Homeland Security, and no disclaimer regarding usage of personal data. “This is a joke,” says immigration and investing expert Nuri Katz. “[The Trump Administration] is asking very wealthy individuals to trust a one-page website that feels like it was created in five minutes by a teenager in his bedroom.” And while Trump told his social media followers that the waitlist for the Gold Card was open, it could take years for applications to be processed. Congress has yet to initiate any changes to immigration and tax law that the program would require. AP Photo/Vahid Salemi Israel launched a series of major military strikes against Iran and its nuclear program late on Thursday, killing several top military officials and nuclear scientists in the country, a move that U.S. officials said was a “unilateral” action by Israel as they denied any involvement by U.S. forces. President Donald Trump urged Iran to make a nuclear deal or face “more brutal” attacks in the future. Global crude oil prices jumped sharply, while U.S. stock futures fell early Friday in the wake of the strikes, which marked a significant escalation of tensions in the Middle East. A federal judge ruled Thursday that President Donald Trump must return control of the California National Guard troops deployed in Los Angeles back to the state’s Governor Gavin Newsom, but an appeals court later temporarily blocked the judge’s order. In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said Trump’s deployment of the National Guard, which was done without Newsom’s approval, was illegal, “exceeding the scope of his statutory authority and violating the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.” Shares of Boeing fell 5% Thursday after a plane operated by Air India crashed shortly following takeoff, killing more than 260 people aboard as well as others on the ground, and adding to the safety concerns that the airplane maker has faced for years. Boeing said it was in contact with Air India, and the aircraft involved with the crash was a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner delivered to Air India in 2014. Digital bank Chime’s stock popped in its debut on the Nasdaq Thursday, rising 37% and bringing its valuation to $16 billion, the latest successful IPO in recent weeks. The 13-year-old bank grew rapidly during the pandemic, and while it maintained that expansion, it spent heavily to get there—making it critical for Chime to find cheaper ways to attract and retain customers. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison overtook Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg to become the second-richest person in the world Thursday, as shares of his cloud computing giant surged amid the AI arms race. Ellison enjoyed the largest daily fortune boost of any billionaire, with his net worth climbing by $25 billion to $242 billion, second only behind his longtime friend Elon Musk. Two long-tenured partners at Y Combinator, which has incubated some of the most successful companies in Silicon Valley—from Airbnb to Dropbox—are leaving the firm to start their own fund, Forbes has learned. While the size of the fund, intended to nurture early stage companies, hasn’t been announced, one source said it will be substantially north of $250 million. Major platforms like Google Cloud and Spotify experienced technical issues on Thursday amid a widespread internet outage, though social media platforms appeared to be largely spared. Cloudflare, which serves tens of millions of web requests per second, said in the afternoon that a number of services suffering “intermittent failures” were being investigated, but later in the day, said services were fully restored. Despite his real estate empire, a majority of President Donald Trump’s fortune—$3.3 billion of his total $5.5 billion—is now tied to crypto, which the president has tapped for cash and worked to promote. The latest shift was when Trump Media and Technology Group purchased crypto to bolster its balance sheet, transforming Trump’s company from a social-media play to a Bitcoin bet. FBI officers physically removed Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., from a press conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles on Thursday as he attempted to shout questions at Noem, an incident that drew bipartisan backlash. Noem falsely claimed in a Fox News interview after the incident that Padilla “started launching towards the podium” and “did not identify himself.” Megan Briggs/Getty Images When Lionel Messi laces up his cleats to compete in the FIFA Club World Cup that begins Saturday, the Argentine soccer superstar will be the highest-paid player there, with $135 million in estimated earnings over the past 12 months. He’ll be joined by other top earners like Real Madrid forward Kylian Mbappé and Manchester City striker Erling Haaland, a confluence of top-earning talent that is a direct result of FIFA’s new format for the tournament. The FAA is investigating a JetBlue flight that skidded off the runway at Boston Logan International Airport, and the airport was under a ground delay Thursday afternoon. The carrier said no one was injured in the incident, which occurred on a flight that originated from Chicago O’Hare International Airport. Drew Angerer/Getty Images Scale AI’s shocking $15 billion deal to sell a 49% stake to Meta has raised the specter that the startup’s $14 billion-valued data labeling business could implode. At play is the concern that Scale, which has been the dominant player in labeling data to help major tech companies and AI startups train their models, could share details about the types of data that leading AI players have used to build their most cutting edge tech with Meta. OpenAI, one of its most prominent customers, has already been winding down its work with Scale, according to four sources with knowledge of its business. Scale AI spokesperson Joe Osborne denied that OpenAI has pulled back its spending. Scale built its business on the back of a massive clickworker army, largely of workers based overseas who would teach AI models by providing context for masses of data. But this kind of work has become a commodity. “Anyone who puts up a team can compete with you, and it comes down to price really quickly,” said Kevin Guo, cofounder of a startup that got out of the data labeling business, in a 2023 interview. WHY IT MATTERS Access to high quality human data is crucial for training powerful AI models, so much so that data has been considered a moat for AI juggernauts like OpenAI and Anthropic in the AI race. Scale AI, which booked $870 million in revenue in 2024, captured the data labeling market early by supplying troves of human-labeled data to companies like Cohere, OpenAI and Microsoft. But Meta owning almost half of Scale would change that equation. MORE How Alexandr Wang Turned An Army Of Clickworkers Into A $7.3 Billion AI Unicorn The House voted to claw back funding from NPR and PBS, in a move known as rescission, as the White House has sought to slash their funding. The legislation will also be considered in the Senate: $9.4 billion: The total amount of the cuts the White House has proposed, including $8.3 billion in funding for USAID September 2027: The date the funds had previously been approved through 15%: The share of PBS’ budget that comes from the federal government Today’s job market is especially tough for entry-level roles, and AI could eliminate up to half of entry-level knowledge work in the next five years, according to Anthropic’s CEO. But rest assured that AI can’t automate creativity and human insight—abilities that haven’t been emphasized in formal training lately. It’s critical for young people to develop skills like storytelling, creative thinking and empathy, and focus on the humanities as core career infrastructure.

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. Opt for AI companies using their competitive advantages to establish leadership positions in big ... More markets. Nvidia was one of the first companies to monetize the AI revolution, but it will not be the last. As AI innovation reshapes business processes, there is ample room for AI software, service and hardware providers to generate meaningful value and wealth — for customers and investors. Identifying which stocks will rise to prominence is the AI investor's big challenge. Below are six strong contenders that are worth a deeper dive. Based on market opportunity, projected results and competitive positioning, one or more of these six AI stocks may be the future star of your growth portfolio: A review of each company follows. For more investing ideas, see best stocks for 2025. Upstart Holdings operates an AI-powered lending marketplace that overhauls the traditional credit-scoring model. The company’s streamlined, all-digital loan applications identify more creditworthy borrowers, improves access to affordable debt and lowers costs for lenders. According to Upstart data, its technology approves 43% more applicants at 33% lower APRs. Upstart quantifies the global credit market at over $25 trillion, with $1 trillion available to origination and servicing platforms. Upstart generated 2024 revenue of $637 million and recorded a net loss of $137 million. In 2025, the company expects $1 billion in revenue and a net loss of $80 million. Per stockanalysis.com, analysts expect the company to generate positive EPS of $1.49 in 2025, rising to over $4.50 by 2029. Upstart stock trades for about $57 per share and is up 138% over the past year. Snowflake operates a cloud-based data warehouse and a platform to access the data for AI and other applications, analytics and collaboration. A Contino review says Snowflake’s platform "enables data storage, processing, and analytic solutions that are faster, easier to use, and far more flexible than traditional offerings." According to Snowflake’s 2025 Investor Day presentation, the company expects its market opportunity to reach $355 billion by calendar year 2029. That's more than double the estimated market size of $170 billion in 2024. Snowflake serves a diverse customer group that includes meal kit company Hello Fresh, German automaker BMW Group and transportation services provider Penske. Customers use Snowflake to support a range of objectives, from cost efficiency to improved customer experiences. In fiscal 2025, Snowflake generated $3.4 billion in revenue and recorded a GAAP operating loss of $1.4 billion. The company expects first-quarter 2026 revenue growth of 21% to 22% with an operating margin of 5%. Analysts expect Snowflake to reach $10 billion in revenue and EPS over $4 in fiscal 2030, according to stockanalysis.com. Snowflake stock trades for about $212 per share and is up 70% over the past year. CrowdStrike operates a cybersecurity solution called Falcon that uses AI to detect and block malware and other digital threats. The company recently announced the release of a new agentic AI with autonomous reasoning and investigative capabilities for faster threat mitigation. CrowdStrike serves more than 70% of Fortune 100 companies and 18 of the top 20 U.S. banks, according to a 2024 investor presentation.

In fiscal 2025, Arm reported revenue of $4 billion and diluted EPS of $0.75. Analysts expect the company will produce revenue of $9.8 billion and EPS of $3.95 in fiscal 2030, per stockanalysis.com. ARM stock trades for about $139 per share and is down 8.4% over the past year. The Trade Desk runs an ad-buying platform that offers highly targeted and global audiences across multiple digital channels, including smart TVs. The company uses AI to analyze millions of ad opportunities each second to identify the most valuable and cost-efficient placements. According to company data, the Trade Desk’s AI can increase advertiser reach by three times and reduce cost-per-action by 34%. Current customers include McDonald’s, Ikea, New York Post, Audi and Kellogg's. The total addressable global advertising market is nearing $1 trillion, according to The Trade Desk’s first quarter 2025 investor presentation. In 2024, The Trade Desk delivered revenue of $2.4 billion and GAAP diluted EPS of $0.78. Analysts expect the company to double its revenue to $5.9 billion and more than quintuple its EPS to $4.42 in 2029, according to stockanalysis.com. TTD stock trades for about $71 per share, after a 26% decline over the past year. Bottom Line The AI revolution is still in its infancy, which means disciplined investments today could pay off handsomely over the next three to five years.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, June 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) and reminds investors of the July 21, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The truth about this fraud was revealed through a series of disclosures culminating in February 2025 and March 2025. In February 2025, DoubleVerify reported disappointing earnings and disclosed a multiyear deceleration trend due to the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. On this news, the price of DoubleVerify stock fell 36 percent. Then, in March 2025, market research company Adalytics Research released a report claiming that DoubleVerify’s web advertisement verification and fraud protection services are ineffective, and that DoubleVerify customers are regularly billed for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding DoubleVerify’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/DV or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Server manufacturers may vary configurations, yielding different results. Results may vary based on use of the latest drivers and optimizations.MI350-004 iiMI350-044: Based on AMD internal testing as of 6/9/2025. Using 8 GPU AMD Instinct™ MI355X Platform measuring text generated online serving inference throughput for Llama 3.1-405B chat model (FP4) compared 8 GPU AMD Instinct™ MI300X Platform performance with (FP8). Test was performed using input length of 32768 tokens and an output length of 1024 tokens with concurrency set to best available throughput to achieve 60ms on each platform, 1 for MI300X (35.3ms) and 64ms for MI355X platforms (50.6ms). Server manufacturers may vary configurations, yielding different results. Performance may vary based on use of latest drivers and optimizations. iii Based on performance testing by AMD Labs as of 6/6/2025, measuring the text generated inference throughput on the LLaMA 3.1-405B model using the FP4 datatype with various combinations of input, output token length with AMD Instinct™ MI355X 8x GPU, and published results for the NVIDIA B200 HGX 8xGPU. Performance per dollar calculated with current pricing for NVIDIA B200 available from Coreweave website and expected Instinct MI355X based cloud instance pricing. Server manufacturers may vary configurations, yielding different results. Performance may vary based on use of latest drivers and optimizations. Current customer pricing as of June 10, 2025, and subject to change. MI350-049 iv MI400-001: Performance projection as of 06/05/2025 using engineering estimates based on the design of a future AMD Instinct MI400 Series GPU compared to the Instinct MI355x, with 2K and 16K prefill with TP8, EP8 and projected inference performance, and using a GenAI training model evaluated with GEMM and Attention algorithms for the Instinct MI400 Series. Results may vary when products are released in market. (MI400-001)v EPYC-030a: Calculation includes 1) base case kWhr use projections in 2025 conducted with Koomey Analytics based on available research and data that includes segment specific projected 2025 deployment volumes and data center power utilization effectiveness (PUE) including GPU HPC and machine learning (ML) installations and 2) AMD CPU and GPU node power consumptions incorporating segment-specific utilization (active vs. idle) percentages and multiplied by PUE to determine actual total energy use for calculation of the performance per Watt. 38x is calculated using the following formula: (base case HPC node kWhr use projection in 2025 * AMD 2025 perf/Watt improvement using DGEMM and TEC +Base case ML node kWhr use projection in 2025 *AMD 2025 perf/Watt improvement using ML math and TEC) /(Base case projected kWhr usage in 2025). For more information, https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/corporate-responsibility/data-center-sustainability.html. vi AMD based advanced racks for AI training/inference in each year (2024 to 2030) based on AMD roadmaps, also examining historical trends to inform rack design choices and technology improvements to align projected goals and historical trends. The 2024 rack is based on the MI300X node, which is comparable to the Nvidia H100 and reflects current common practice in AI deployments in 2024/2025 timeframe. The 2030 rack is based on an AMD system and silicon design expectations for that time frame. In each case, AMD specified components like GPUs, CPUs, DRAM, storage, cooling, and communications, tracking component and defined rack characteristics for power and performance. Calculations do not include power used for cooling air or water supply outside the racks but do include power for fans and pumps internal to the racks.Performance improvements are estimated based on progress in compute output (delivered, sustained, not peak FLOPS), memory (HBM) bandwidth, and network (scale-up) bandwidth, expressed as indices and weighted by the following factors for training and inference. Performance and power use per rack together imply trends in performance per watt over time for training and inference, then indices for progress in training and inference are weighted 50:50 to get the final estimate of AMD projected progress by 2030 (20x). The performance number assumes continued AI model progress in exploiting lower precision math formats for both training and inference which results in both an increase in effective FLOPS and a reduction in required bandwidth per FLOP. vii AMD estimated the number of racks to train a typical notable AI model based on EPOCH AI data (https://epoch.ai). For this calculation we assume, based on these data, that a typical model takes 1025 floating point operations to train (based on the median of 2025 data), and that this training takes place over 1 month. FLOPs needed = 10^25 FLOPs/(seconds/month)/Model FLOPs utilization (MFU) = 10^25/(2.6298*10^6)/0.6. Racks = FLOPs needed/(FLOPS/rack in 2024 and 2030). The compute performance estimates from the AMD roadmap suggests that approximately 276 racks would be needed in 2025 to train a typical model over one month using the MI300X product (assuming 22.656 PFLOPS/rack with 60% MFU) and <1 fully utilized rack would be needed to train the same model in 2030 using a rack configuration based on an AMD roadmap projection. These calculations imply a >276-fold reduction in the number of racks to train the same model over this six-year period. Electricity use for a MI300X system to completely train a defined 2025 AI model using a 2024 rack is calculated at ~7GWh, whereas the future 2030 AMD system could train the same model using ~350 MWh, a 95% reduction. AMD then applied carbon intensities per kWh from the International Energy Agency World Energy Outlook 2024 [https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2024]. IEA’s stated policy case gives carbon intensities for 2023 and 2030. We determined the average annual change in intensity from 2023 to 2030 and applied that to the 2023 intensity to get 2024 intensity (434 CO2 g/kWh) versus the 2030 intensity (312 CO2 g/kWh). Emissions for the 2024 baseline scenario of 7 GWh x 434 CO2 g/kWh equates to approximately 3000 metric tC02, versus the future 2030 scenario of 350 MWh x 312 CO2 g/kWh equates to around100 metric tCO2.

More Santiago/Getty Images) In the race to finally convince consumers of the benefits of AR and AI powered smart glasses, the global tech giants are heading back to the future – with stores. As Google, Apple, Meta and Snap go head to head for what they believe will be a lucrative growth market, three of the four have established store networks to introduce their products to a new generation of consumers – many of whom will not have seen Google’s pioneering but unsuccessful first attempt to create the market. Meta has partnered with Ray Ban, Apple has its own flagship store network to leverage, while the big headline came when Google recently committed to as much as $150 million with the consumer eyewear company Warby Parker. They are set to jointly develop AI-powered smart glasses based on Android XR and Google has already committed $75 million to Warby Parker’s product development and commercialization costs. Google will invest an additional $75 million, taking an equity stake in Warby Parker, should the trendy eyewear manufacturer meet certain milestones. The news immediately turbocharged Warby Parker’s stock price, which is up a little short of a fifth since the announcement after a challenging year to date which means that despite the boost the value is still around 11% off year to date. In May, Warby Parker announced first-quarter net revenue increased nearly 12% year over year to $223.8 million. It also reported its first positive quarterly net income as a public company, with $3.5 million in income compared with a loss of about $2.7 million in Q1 2024. It also opened 11 net new stores, ending the quarter with 287 locations nationwide. At the Google I/O 2025 event, Google also announced partnerships with several companies to develop smart glasses with Gemini AI and AR capabilities, including Samsung and uber trendy Korean eyewear retailer Gentle Monster. Google has no doubt taken a close look at Meta’s smart glasses strategy after the latter found success partnering and investing in the maker of iconic sunglasses brand Ray-Ban to develop its smart glasses. One of the reasons that Ray-Ban and Meta have acheived some success is that the smart glasses, far from the clunky original iterations, have a stylish and familiar design and they are being sold across Ray-Ban’s stores network.

More Cros/NurPhoto via Getty Images) It seems likely that Google will use the same playbook with Warby Parker, taking advantage of the eyewear company’s popular frame designs and its growing network of retail stores and online presence around the country. In announcing the collaboration, Warby Parker and Google said that they intend to launch a series of products over time and forecast that their first line of eyewear will launch “after 2025” and will incorporate multimodal AI with prescription and non-prescription glasses. Meantime, Snap has announced its own plans to release a sixth-generation of its augmented reality glasses next year. The company behind Snapchat said that its next-generation glasses will be called Specs, marking a break from the company’s Spectacles branding that it has used for prior versions of its wearable devices. Specs will use AR technology to let wearers see and interact with digital imagery overlaid over the physical world and its new glasses will be smaller and lighter than their predecessors, the company said, with Snap’s most recent Spectacles released in September 2024 to developers only. Those glasses were made available under a leasing model that required users to commit to paying $99 a month for a full year. Apple is also working on its own smart glasses, based on chips used in the Apple Watch that require less energy than the components in some of its other products like the iPhone, iPad and Mac, but they may not hit the market until sometime in 2027. Apple has already leveraged its store network to launch a host of products and updates and will be able to use those stores again to provide a platform for its smart glasses technology when it finally arrives.

Title: What Drove Meta Stock's 2x Rise?

More at Parc des Expositions Porte de Versailles on June 12, 2025 in Paris, France. VivaTech, the biggest tech show in Europe but also in a unique digital format, for 4 days of reconnection and relaunch thanks to innovation. (Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images) META Platforms stock (NASDAQ: META) has witnessed a substantial increase, spurred by investor enthusiasm over rising user interaction and consistently robust quarterly earnings. So far this year, Meta has gained 16%, significantly outperforming the wider NASDAQ index, which has increased by 2%. Examining a slightly extended timeframe, Meta’s outperformance is even more pronounced. Since the beginning of 2024, Meta’s stock has achieved a striking 97% return, rising from about $350 to roughly $700 per share. In comparison, the NASDAQ index recorded a 31% increase during the same timeframe. The remarkable 97% increase in Meta’s stock can be linked to three primary factors: We will explore the details of these factors. While META stock has had a positive trajectory, if you seek an upside with a steadier experience than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P and recorded >91% returns since inception. Additionally, see – Is Oracle Stock A Buy At $190? Meta Platforms stands as the world’s leading social network that connects individuals with friends and family. The company generates revenue mainly through advertising, which it offers to marketers by targeting specific demographics based on information shared by users on its platforms. Meta Platforms’ revenue growth recently can be credited to an increase in ad impressions as well as a rise in the average price per ad. Additionally, Meta’s family daily active users (DAP) has grown by 7.5% from 3.19 billion in 2021 to 3.43 billion now. The company benefits from its AI initiatives aimed at enhancing advertising. It also intends to leverage AI for generating more content. Not only has the company’s sales improved in the past three years, but its net income margin has expanded from 29% in 2023 to 39% currently. Meta’s outstanding shares have also decreased by 1% over this timeframe, largely due to the $63 billion the company invested in share buybacks since 2023. The rise in revenues combined with margin expansion and fewer shares has resulted in the company’s net profit of $25.58 now, an increase of 72% from $14.87 in 2023. Investors are increasingly optimistic about Meta’s stock, and rightly so. The company is experiencing a healthy increase in both ad impressions and the average price per ad, which directly enhances its sales. A significant factor driving this optimism is Meta’s proactive investment in AI. This is not merely a trendy term for Meta; AI is significantly contributing to heightened advertising revenues by: Meta is deeply incorporating generative AI throughout its entire social media ecosystem. This includes innovative features such as the Meta AI virtual assistant for chat, advanced image generation, and robust photo editing tools. Moreover, its Llama AI model is quickly gaining a substantial user base, further solidifying its leadership in AI. These potent growth drivers, coupled with Meta’s improving profitability—evidenced by a solid 39% net income margin—have significantly enhanced investor confidence. Consequently, the company’s Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio has notably expanded from 6.9x trailing revenues in 2023 to 10.6x currently. Indeed, META stock has performed well since the start of 2024. Nonetheless, the rise in META stock has not been steady. The stock’s returns were 23% in 2021, -64% in 2022, 194% in 2023, and 66% in 2024. In contrast, returns for the S&P 500 were 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, 24% in 2023, and 23% in 2024 — suggesting that META underperformed the S&P in 2021 and 2022. Conversely, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, has successfully outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four years. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; offering a smoother ride, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Considering the current uncertain macroeconomic environment characterized by trade disputes, interest rate adjustments, and geopolitical tensions, could META find itself in a situation similar to that of 2021 and 2022, potentially underperforming the S&P over the next twelve months — or will it experience a strong upturn? From a valuation perspective, we believe that Meta’s stock is currently fully valued. Our evaluation places Meta Platforms’ valuation at $702 per share, which is quite close to its current market price. The stock is currently trading at 10.6 times its trailing revenues, noticeably higher than its four-year average Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio of 6.8x. While a slight increase in Meta’s valuation multiple appears reasonable given its recent strong advertising growth, investors should also take into account the inherent risks. The exact impact that AI will have on the company’s long-term earnings growth remains uncertain. This uncertainty renders Meta’s ongoing, aggressive investments in AI a potential risk factor. For context, Meta has already invested $77 billion in capital expenditures since 2023, and it intends to allocate an additional $64 to $72 billion this year alone for AI infrastructure. While META stock seems fully valued, it is useful to examine how Meta Platform’s peers perform on important metrics.

Title: The World’s Largest Technology Companies 2025: Nvidia Continues To Soar Amid AI Boom

ByRashi Shrivastava ByRashi Shrivastava, Forbes Staff. Nvidia's cofounder and CEO Jensen Huang is worth an estimated $125 billion thanks to its stock's rapid rise. The whiplash growth of artificial intelligence has minted a gaggle of billionaires and unicorns, but chip behemoth Nvidia continues to remain among the largest beneficiaries of the AI boom against all odds. The company took a hit on the $50 billion Chinese AI chip market after the Trump administration placed export controls on its H20 chips, which “effectively closed” the market to the U.S. industry, CEO Jensen Huang said in a recent earnings call. Earlier this year its stock briefly nosedived after Chinese darkhorse DeepSeek’s popular AI model launch triggered a panic sell-off. Despite challenges—external and internal—the $3.5 trillion (market cap) juggernaut has continued to capitalize on the global demand for AI infrastructure. In its latest quarterly earnings in May, Nvidia beat Wall Street analysts’ expectations and reported $44.06 billion in revenue, up 69% from a year ago. A hefty portion of its business growth, $39.1 billion of its revenue, comes from its data center operations as the company plans to build “AI factories” in the US and internationally that will help billions of people across the world run AI tools like ChatGPT. In late May, Nvidia said it will supply its powerful silicon chips to Stargate UAE, a joint project with OpenAI, Oracle and others to build a 1 gigawatt “compute cluster” in Abu Dhabi's AI campus. Such projects have helped push the company to the top 100 on Forbes’ Global 2000 ranking the world’s largest public companies. It’s now at position No. 47, 63 spots higher than last year, thanks to a period of strong business growth spurred by widespread use of generative AI. The company is now among the likes of massive tech conglomerates like Tencent (No. 37) and Taiwan Semiconductor (No. 38). The Global 2000 measures market value, revenue, profit and assets equally using the last 12 months of data as of April 25, 2025. Even as AI companies have shifted from training large language models to building applications on top of them, they require a steady supply of Nvidia's powerful silicon chips called graphics processing units (GPUs) to do what’s called inference— where a model produces an answer based on new information fed to it in real time. To top that, new so-called “reasoning AI models” that take a step-by-step approach to answer complex problems consume 100 times more computational resources, creating more demand for Nvidia’s hardware. While Nvidia is the market leader, other companies are growing as well. Semiconductor company Micron, which builds memory and data storage products, has hopped more than 400 spots on the list and is now at No. 228. And South Korean memory chip provider SK Hynix Inc is up 419 spots to No. 155. But not all semiconductor companies have benefited from the AI frenzy. Silicon Valley stalwart Intel, now at No. 488, dropped 381 spots on the Forbes’ Global 2000 this year. The company has struggled after a string of woes including declining revenue, leadership challenges and losing its market share to rivals like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Arm Holdings. In December 2024, Intel’s CEO Pat Gelsinger stepped down, and was replaced by Lip-Bu Tan in March 2025. In April, the company said its plans to lay off 20% of its staff, Bloomberg reported. The largest tech companies like Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Alphabet have all made gigantic bets on artificial intelligence, throwing billions of dollars and the best engineers to develop AI models and build products for their users. Those four firms are all among the top 20 of the Global 2000. South Korean conglomerate Samsung is the only tech giant based overseas in the top 20, moving up to 19th this year. One new AI beneficiary to watch is CoreWeave, which rents cloud computing power to customers and went public in March. It’s making its first appearance on the list at 1,799th this year and is likely to move up fast. It’s not profitable yet, but after the data was compiled for this year’s Global 2000 on April 25, it reported $982 million in first quarter revenue, a 420% increase compared with the first quarter last year, and its stock price has surged 250%.

As part of the integration, all bridged USDC tokens on World Chain were automatically upgraded to the newly launched native USDC. “We’re excited to announce that native USDC and CCTP V2 are now live on World Chain,” the firm wrote in a blog about the announcement. “This upgrade enhances liquidity, security, and capital efficiency for developers and users across the World Chain ecosystem.” The expansion now puts USDC, the second largest stablecoin, on 21 different blockchains, the announcement says. Circle stock (CRCL) is currently trading above $116, up more than 10% on the day and sitting at a price nearly four times its $31 IPO price. Listed on the Nasdaq, CRCL pumped as high as $138.57 on Monday. After hitting the public market last week, the stock was initially halted multiple times on its first day of trading, jumping to more than three times its IPO price in a matter of minutes. That debut exceeded the initial performance of major publicly traded tech companies like Meta, Robinhood, and Airbnb upon their respective listings. The IPO, which raised $1.1 billion for the firm and early shareholders, accelerates a trend of crypto companies going public. In May, trading platform eToro made its debut on public markets. Prior to that, Bitcoin rewards company Fold went public as well. Neither, though, saw as much success upon debut as shares of CRCL, which scored a major victory when compared to the initial listings of other crypto-focused companies, in terms of share price surge after offering. However, another prominent crypto firm may join the race soon, with New York-based exchange Gemini recently filing for its own IPO. Circle, now valued around $28.34 billion, sought to go public as early as 2022. But plans to go public via a merger with a SPAC fell through at the time.

Title: They made Balatro for stock trading and I fear I may never write another article ever again

All my cards. Gone. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. There's something alluring about high finance, isn't there? Mostly, I suppose, it's the promise of generating absolutely enormous amounts of money for very little actual work, but it's undeniable that the industry—such as it is—has gone out of its way to cloak itself in a certain mystique. The suits, the jargon, the barking into telephones in smoke-filled rooms: what is ultimately just a building full of boys who did boring degrees and have too much money sure does manage to make itself appealing and mysterious, like they were a cabal of sorcerers or something. All this is to explain why I continue to find myself suckered into any and every game that lets me pretend to be one of these masters of the universe, like the excellent Stonks-9800 and, now, the Steam Next Fest demo for Insider Trading. Much like its namesake, Insider Trading is fun, profitable, and victimless, and I strongly recommend you give it a try. Because it's Balatro. Someone went and made Balatro but stock trading and, friends, I fear for my ability to get anything done ever again. This is a roguelike deckbuilder (as are most games in 2025) with a wobbly, warbly, CRT-style interface that sees you assemble absurd multipliers out of painstakingly composed hands of cards, all while using a meta-currency to amass perks that change the flow of the game, cut away at or add cards to your deck, and to optimise your hand. It's not poker-themed, though. Where Balatro had you assemble real-life poker hands to generate your score, Insider Trading just pulls 10 cards from your deck and triggers them in whatever order you leave them in your hand. The goal is to amass enough money (points) to hit a certain target by the end of a week: $1,200 by Friday, $2,000 by next Friday, that kind of thing. At the start of a turn you can either skip—if you think things will go badly—or trade, at which point you'll buy the maximum number of stocks you can with whatever cash you have and wait for your assembled hand to affect the stock price. Assuming you did your maths right, you'll sell off those stocks for more money than you started with. Though, hopefully you won't increase the stock price to something higher than you can afford. It starts off simple enough. You might pull six cards that increase the stock price by anywhere from 1% to 5% each, and another four that decrease it by the same amount, but things quickly get weirder. For instance: This card will add or subtract 10% to the price only if it's played first, this card will delete other cards of a certain suit if you place it adjacent to them, this card will buff other suits by 1.5x each time it's triggered. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I made full use of that last one. Every time I amassed enough tokens to buy a new perk, I stacked on another 'trigger your first card three times' and let it ride, amassing enough of them to trigger my first card 12x every turn and almost obviating the entire rest of my hand. It worked out pretty well, right up until I triggered an event based around shorting, where suddenly it became necessary to decrease the price rather than increase it to make money. It rather made me and my deck composed entirely around buffing the price up a little bit redundant, and I quickly found myself reduced to penury as my fortune. Sound good? Of course it does. So I definitely recommend checking out Insider Trading's demo while you have a chance. Also, you'll always have a chance, because although its demo is featured in Steam Next Fest, it's not a Next Fest-exclusive demo. I wouldn't dally though, the market waits for no one. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together One of Josh's first memories is of playing Quake 2 on the family computer when he was much too young to be doing that, and he's been irreparably game-brained ever since.

What if the problem isn’t the problem… but the way you’re looking at it? In this episode of JUST Branding, we’re joined by the brilliant and delightfully unconventional Rory Sutherland, Vice Chairman of Ogilvy UK, TED speaker, and author of Alchemy: The Surprising Power of Ideas That Don’t Make Sense. sponsored message Rory takes us deep into the world of problem framing, a powerful technique that flips business challenges on their head to reveal bold, creative brand solutions hiding in plain sight. We explore: This episode is a goldmine for strategists, creatives, and brand leaders looking to sharpen their thinking and shift from default logic to magic logic. Warning: Your brain might never see a brief the same way again. Love the show? Please review us on Apple. sponsored message Brand Master Secrets helps you become a brand strategist and earn specialist fees. And in my opinion, this is the most comprehensive brand strategy course on the market. sponsored message The course gave me all the techniques and processes and more importantly… all the systems and tools I needed to build brand strategies for my clients. This is the consolidated “fast-track” version to becoming a brand strategist. I wholeheartedly endorse this course for any designer who wants to become a brand strategist and earn specialist fees. Check out the 15-minute video about the course, which lays out exactly what you get in the Brand Master Secrets. Having a great brand means you get to play the game of capitalism on easy mode. People inherently trust you more, people are happier basically making an impulse purchase from a brand than they are from someone they’ve never heard of. So a brand has an effect in lots and lots of ways, which I think grow, by the way, exponentially with brand fame. And we shouldn’t be afraid of simply saying a large part of branding is being famous. Hello, and welcome to JUST Branding, the only podcast dedicated to helping designers and entrepreneurs grow brands. Here are your hosts, Jacob Cass and Matt Davies. All right, before we jump in, if you’re serious about mastering branding and building a thriving creative business, the Brand Builders Alliance is for you. Inside, you’ll get live masterclasses, mentorship from our eight resident coaches, a stacked resource vault and a global network of brand builders who actually get it. If you’re done winging it alone and are ready to scale with structure, support and serious momentum, head over to joinbba.com and get on the wait list. That’s joinbba.com. Now, let’s get into the show. Hello, everybody, and welcome to another episode of JUST Branding. Today, we are very, very excited because we have the one and only Rory Sutherland on the show. Rory, if you’ve never heard of him before, where have you been? He is the vice chairman of Ogilvy UK, where he spent, I mean, it says down here the last three decades, but he doesn’t look that old, so I’m sure that’s not the case. The last three decades applying behavioral science to some of the world’s biggest brands. You will know Rory from his best-selling book, Alchemy, which I’ve got here, and if you haven’t read that, you definitely need to, his TEDx talks, which have racked up over 15 million views, and his uncanny knack for turning irrational ideas into astonishing commercial results. In our conversation today, we’re going to be focusing in on problem framing and this idea around reframing problems so that constraints become creative springboards that spark different questions and help brands come up with more valuable answers for their consumers. More on that later. Before then, Rory, welcome to the show. Thank you for coming on. Ah, it’s a pleasure. What a joy. Really happy to be here. Firstly, just to give us a snapshot of, for those people that maybe have been living under a rock and have never heard of you, give us a bit of a snapshot of your journey and how you became sort of focused on behavioural science. Very simply, my first job was other than driving a forklift truck at the Ribena factory when I was a student and working for my dad who was self-employed. My first sort of full-time job was in what was then called Ogilvy and Maither Direct, now called Ogilvy One, which was the direct marketing wing of Ogilvy and Maither at the time. That was in 1988. And it was an incredibly lucky and fortunate place at which to start work because, of course, it was that part of advertising which was measurable. By the way, you know, there was a downside to that. And I’ll come to that later, which is the good thing about measurement is you can compare what’s working and what’s not working and what’s working better. The bad thing about measurement is you’re never allowed to do anything you can’t actually measure, which is, if you like, it’s a double-edged sword. However, what we were doing was effectively behavioral economics avant la lettre. We were performing enormous randomized control trials of both creative and media and targeting and measuring the comparative effect of different changes, which very, very quickly caused you to realize that what motivated people to do things, what was important in terms of a marketing communication, wasn’t necessarily either what research would tell you was important or what rational economic models would tell you was important. So you would repeatedly find utterly bizarre effects. One of the earliest ones was a simple test for what was then called British Telecom, where if you sold a product and you allowed people to respond by phone, you got a 2% response rate. If you allowed them only to respond by post, all other things being equal, you got a 4% response rate. And if you gave them the choice of both, you got a 6% response rate. I think I’m 0.1% off on a few of those figures, but I haven’t got the data anymore because this was 1989. But that’s the kind of thing that you’d find. Now, an economist would accept the fact that there’s something called transaction costs. You know, people are happier engaging in one, responding in one medium rather than another. And therefore, that’s not going to be negligible. But that finding that 2 plus 4 equals 6, that effectively every additional channel of response you offer creates more response, is something which has… I always argued then, look, these things… I said, there’s a science here for which we have no name. In other words, really understanding what it is that drives people to change their behavior, as opposed to falling back on rational-seeming theories about what matters. And it was only years later when I discovered accidentally the existence of behavioral economics, nudge theory, Kahneman, Tversky, Arielle, Thaler, et cetera, Sunstein. It was only then that I realized that there were a tiny group of people engaged in this thing, and it did in fact have a name. And I always thought it had a vastly greater importance. David Ogilvy would have been the same. David Ogilvy always said people should start by working in direct response advertising because it gives you a effectively an instinctive feeling for what works. And so that was the thing that really… And of course I was in the right place at the right time. You know, I already knew quite a bit. In fact, when I eventually met Thaler and Kahneman and people like that, what was quite surprising to me is I had interesting things to say to them, and they were interested in what I had to say, because I was party to all kinds of experiments which weren’t in the academic literature because they were in the commercial field. Amazing. Amazing. Well, you’ve sort of touched on it there, this idea of problem framing, because this is something I know that you speak a lot about in your book Alchemy, and it’s kind of a key thing that we want to tuck into with you today. So perhaps before we get into some details, let’s sort of start high level for folks, perhaps, who are just kind of grappling with this for the first time. Well, how would you sort of describe problem framing and specifically, I mean, our audience are all trying to build brands or involved in brand building strategically somehow. How is problem framing helpful for, say, somebody who’s trying to build a brand to think through? Okay, I’ll reframe this, which is only appropriate. Go for it. Which is to say that how is not problem framing an issue in business and indeed governmental and institutional decision making. In other words, if you don’t spend time, famously, I think Einstein said, if I had something like an hour left to save the world, I’d spend 59 minutes defining the problem and one minute solving it. It’s understood in mathematics, obviously. Mathematicians would understand this instinctively, that if you can redefine the question, you’ve given yourself a second chance at solving it. And not doing that by effectively saying, we have to solve every problem through brute force methods. And if you rewrite the brief or redefine the problem, you’re cheating. That is hugely problematic because I think that’s an instinctive thing which has come to us through our educational system, which is, I’ve been given a problem, the problem contains all the information that I need to solve the problem, and there’s a single right answer. That’s your typical high school multiple choice maths question. All right? I mean, interestingly, by the way, a few people I know have had an issue with IQ tests because they say an IQ test to make it easy to mark is multiple choice, and when you have multiple choice answers, by definition, the questions can only have one right answer. And so there is this fundamental tendency where I think we take the problem as it is currently defined, we work on it using the approved sequential logical methods for proceeding from that definition of the problem. And whatever is our best shot at it following that process, we then deem to be not only right or interesting or worth testing or worth exploring, we deem it to be the only right answer. And the point I’m making there is that actually, in many cases, the problem isn’t as currently defined, or by describing the problem in a different way, you arrive at a completely different avenue for exploration. Okay? So two things that are problematic there. One, people have this instinctive feeling that if I redefine the problem or rewrite the question I’ve been given, I’m cheating. Okay? That’s true in a maths exam or whatever. You’re not allowed to do this in, you know, history 101. I don’t really like that question about the Norman Conquest. So I’m going to answer a question about the Roman invasion. Okay? That’s obviously a con. But actually, in real life problem solving, that’s exactly what you often need to do. That’s the first part. The second point is, and this is a really important one, particularly in any institutional setting, okay, is that if you want to signal that you care about a problem, you naturally want to tackle the problem head on in the most obvious way possible, okay? We have a problem with not enough luggage going through X-ray machines in airports. Therefore, we must hire more security staff. And it’s a very, very fashionable belief, which, you know, and generally it involves the trade off or there’s a cost attached. And it’s a very, very logical way to solve that problem, okay? Because you’re doing what effectively is a direct head-to-head conflict, with the problem as currently defined. With all the parameters that are already in place. So I’m going to give you this example. When you go through airport X-ray machines, one of the most common problems that happens, and it’s interesting who notices this and who doesn’t, is that people start taking their jackets and belts out of the trays as soon as they emerge from the X-ray machine, okay? The problem that creates is that they’re effectively holding up their tray so that no future trays can be scanned. Now, what you’ll occasionally notice is that there’s a shrewd person who understands the sort of systems thinking who stands close to the X-ray machine and whizzes the trays along the conveyor belt to the far end, so that there’s the maximum buffer available for trays to come through and be scanned, and then five people can be removing their belts and jackets and bags in parallel, rather than one person doing it in series. Okay? Now, the way, you know, before you hire more X-ray staff or spend another two million pounds on an amazing scanning machine, maybe you ought to be just instructing the staff who are currently there to actually whizz the trays along to the end, so that the retrieval process can happen in parallel rather than in series, so the throughput of the X-ray machine without any expenditure on money or staff can be trebled. Okay? And so, that will be the typical example I’d give, where it’s very, very easy. One, people think they’re cheating if they change the question, but actually the only thing that matters is the objective, not really the question, and even the objective is open to debate. Okay? When you have a proxy objective, generally, it’s quite arbitrary. Okay? You know, we need to make this brand appeal more to young people. Well, you know, it would be an absolutely, you know, almost stereotypical form of client paranoia. And therefore, the natural thing to do is to do ads which very explicitly say, hey, young people, you love this brand. Quite frequently, because of the fibles of human psychology, what that creates is a kind of reactance. Okay, which is you’re trying too hard, disco, vicar, you know what I mean? You know, it’s the whole thing of, you know, you don’t look now, but your strategy is showing. Yeah. Now, there may be lots of ways you can appeal more to young people. I once had this thing where we noticed, you know, we don’t, you know, we’re not selling that much to the young. And I said, young people have yet less money than old people. Why don’t you just try offering Klarner? So, you know, what I’m saying is that, and I think it’s really important, because one of the things that really bothers me about this whole business is, ever since the advertising business was paid by the hour, it lost something, which was, first of all, clients didn’t engage you very early on because they didn’t want the meter to start running. Whereas when you were paid on commission, they got in touch with you day one because after all, you were free until they actually bought some media. All right? The second thing is that consequently, because of that general impatience and the idea that efficiency is on time and in budget, that’s the kind of goal. We’ve lost what I call the exploratory phase, and we’re more and more inclined to rush into dumb execution. One of the daft things I think we’ve also done is create a planning department, which instead of working in parallel with the creative department, works in advance of it. Howell-Henry spotted that this was a fault, and they created a kind of five-person team that worked on the whole problem from soup to nuts, which always struck me as a fundamentally useful idea, which produced, by the way, very, very interesting advertising. You know, it was empirically quite a successful approach. But for whatever reason, nobody’s actually, you know, nobody’s really replicated this. sponsored message Yeah, it’s funny, isn’t it? Because one of the things that I like as a sort of a solo consultant is that I get to do that. You know, I kind of, people will approach with, as you get this idea that we have this problem. And I always say to my clients, look, you know, it may well be that we have, that is the problem that you’ve discussed. But before I just take that and start trying to solve for that, can I interrogate it a bit? I want to go talk to some customers, talk to your staff, talk to your leadership team. And then we’ll settle on that, you know, and then we’ll explore a solution further once we verify that that is a problem to attack. So Roger L. Martin talks about this sort of very narrow island of factual data surrounded by a sea of uncertainty. And for some reason, we feel we have to start the journey from that island, even though it’s a very restrictive and narrow place from which to start. The analogy I use, which is where I think people get it right, and where I think people, sometimes highly intelligent people get it wrong, is if you look at police work, they accept if you’ve got a criminal you’re trying to catch, they accept that there are two phases to the investigation. There’s the investigative phase, and then there’s the evidential phase. Eventually, you’ve got to prove the guy’s guilty, right, in a court of law. And to prove the guy’s guilty, you’re not allowed to use anecdotes, you’re not allowed to use entirely circumstantial information. But you are allowed to use that information in the investigative phase. So the standard police question would be, if someone’s weirdly found dead in a downstairs basement flat, would be to go next door and to ask the neighbors, did you notice anything unusual between the hours of, you know, 9 p.m. and 1 a.m. on, you know, on the third of whatever. Now that’s a totally open-ended question, okay? The answer could be literally anything. And it’s almost certainly not going to have any evidential value. I heard a scream at 11.30. Well, that narrows down your time of day, possibly, if you believe they’re telling the truth. I saw a strange man in a white van drive up repeatedly, and he kept driving back dozens again. You can’t imprison someone for life for driving a white van in a funny way, although, probabilistically, it wouldn’t be a bad approach, actually, given the serial killer’s love of the white van. But you can’t reasonably, you know, imprison someone for that. That has no evidential value, it has a minor evidential value. But it really tells you, let’s look at the CCTV and see if we can see any white vans that re-appear more than once and find out if the person driving said van is somehow a bit iffy. Now, again, we’re not yet in the evidential phase, we’re just in the exploratory investigative phase, but we’re allowed to use information there which isn’t entirely robust. And that’s only correct. And similarly, you know, what you will probably do in the course of investigation is you will redefine what you’re trying to do several times in the course of that investigation. You know, first of all, it’s find something unusual. Secondly, there’s a line of inquiry around white vans, okay? Thirdly, you would probably, if budget allows, you’d also say, let’s also proceed on the basis that the white vans are relevant, because we could be missing something here. Okay? That could be coincidence and it could be meaningful. And so the whole thing is an iterative process. And what we’ve tried to do is turn it into a linear process because, and I’ve got a theory about this, which is one of the reasons why ad agencies don’t experiment very much with their process, is because we’ve got to justify our activities to some procurement department, who want to know what we’re doing for every second the meter’s ticking. And we have to maintain the pretense that every single step of this journey is a sequential stepping stone towards this somehow singular and miraculously perfect solution. Consequently, if you come up with an interesting approach like Howell-Henry, with five people working in parallel, procurement probably won’t accept that because they’ll say, we need to be able to compare your costs on a like-for-like basis with every other agency that’s pitching for this count. So innovation is not allowed because it destroys our ability to compare on very narrow cost metrics. It strikes me that a lot of these supposedly well-intentioned parts of business actually have extraordinary dangerous unintended consequences because when you take a business and you optimize for only part of it, and you do so basically with the aim of self-justification, it’s highly likely that you’re over-optimizing what you need to lay claim to and under-optimizing other important facets in any decision. There’s a great book now by Margaret Heffernan, which is called Uncertainty, I think. And it’s basically a plea for people and organizations to accept existing in a state of uncertainty. Because what we do is a large number of people find being in a state of indecision or uncertainty deeply painful. Yeah, it’s like a psychological… It is. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I desperately need to pretend I know what’s going on here. Or I desperately need to pretend I can make a plausible story up to explain what on earth happened here. And therefore, we rush to kind of what you might call pre-rationalization. Yeah. I once heard it. It’s like, you know, in the ancient maps, where, you know, they sort of hadn’t explored areas, they would like just draw a little dragon in the corner. Here be dragons. Here be dragons. It’s that sort of idea, isn’t it? It’s like we don’t like being in the dragon pit. Like we want to be in a land where we know for sure where we are. So, yeah. Jacob, do you have a question to lead the conversation forward? Yeah, Rory. So, hi, Jacob here. I want to jump into some practical tools and examples that we could use. So, if a team is feeling boxed in by a brief, like what’s an exercise or something you would do to shift their mindset? Is it like a question or a template or how do you start that shift? Well, it doesn’t have to shift their mindset at all. You could shift their behavior and then their mindset will follow. So, actually, we know this from quite a lot of evidence in brain science that quite often attitudinal change actually lags behavioral change. In other words, I like this because I do it as opposed to I do this because I liked it in advance. And by the way, there are rational reasons for this, which is once we have experience of something, we often like it more than we expected. Okay. And the classic case of behavioral change versus attitudinal change, which I think is relevant to the electric car industry as well, is I don’t know how this applies in Australia, probably exactly the same way. British people for years were hugely resistant to automatic transmission in cars. Oh, no, no, no. I like, I like that. The sense of control, that’s something Americans have. No, no, no. I can’t stand the idea of an automatic car. Okay. No, no, no. I like the feeling that I can change, you know, da-da-da-da-da-da. And they all came up with these after, and you couldn’t change their minds, really. Okay. Until they drove an automatic car, at which point nobody ever went back. Okay. Don’t get me wrong. Okay. If I moved to the north of Scotland and I lived sort of half a mile from the A9, and I had rolling highland roads with no traffic on, and I had the joy of double-D clutching, okay, I might, might go back to a manual car. But for all practical day-to-day purposes, once you’ve had an automatic, you never go back. And once you’ve had one pedal driving in an electric car, you never go back. Driving a car is just mildly irritating. So it isn’t necessarily the job of assuming you have to change someone’s attitude to something in order to get them to do it. Sometimes you get them to do it in order to change their attitude to it. Now that strikes me as hugely important. And I’ll give you another example of this. So one of the things that does is it does actually change our attitude to sales promotion. Not necessarily to boring money off sales promotion, which I think can be good, can be bad. It’s not inherently bad, but it should be the, the last resort should be bribing your people to buy your product, okay? But it does, for example, when we talk to Great British Railways, one of the things we’d say is, look, there are something like 70% of the population are what’s called rail rejectors. Some of them have good reasons. They live in a part of the country which is totally all served by rail, for example. Okay, fine. But there’s this huge percentage of people who don’t like railways because they never use it, okay? And there’s a famous joke line about Guinness, I’ve never tried it because I don’t like it, okay, right? And in a sense, those people are caught in a kind of mental loop of they don’t use the railways, so therefore they’ve never had any incentive. Why would I have an incentive to have an opinion that conflicts with my existing behavior? So in Denmark, what they do is they give everybody free rail travel on their birthday. Now, I would argue there’s a whole chunk of people. One of my ideas was increased car tax by 100 pounds a year, but give every person who taxes their car 150 pounds worth of off-peak rail vouchers to use whenever they like on any off-peak train, i.e. train that isn’t already crowded. I mean, those journeys are more or less free anyway, because you’re moving trains around the country full of fresh air. And so the incremental, the marginal cost of an extra passenger is zero. And my argument for doing this is that if you make four train journeys a year, next time you have to make a journey, at least rail is in your repertoire. It’s in your consideration set. Not saying you’ll go, I’m not suggesting people will go, oh, this is total epiphany. I’ve seen the lights. I’m selling my car and I’m going to go everywhere by train. It’s simply the fact that they will now consider the train as an option because they’ve had experience of using it under reasonably benign circumstances. They can see the benefits of the train and they can see the downsides of the train. Whereas people who only use a car just have imagined downsides of the railway. Also, the first time you use a train is a painful experience because everything is unfamiliar and you need to work out where to park and where you buy a ticket and how much it costs and where you stand and all that stuff, which when you’ve used a train five or six times, then becomes system one rather than system two. It becomes then relatively instinctive and a bit painless. So I wouldn’t even start from the assumption that you’re trying to change someone’s attitude. I’d just say there is somewhere there is a behavioral bottleneck in the system, which we need to use whatever tools are available to address. Then you have to ask your secondary question, which is, is that the real bottleneck? Which is there’s no point in getting people to think differently about something if it doesn’t translate into behavior. So if the real bottleneck is, you know, so this is really important, by the way, because you can identify what appears to be a pinch point in your business. But if there’s an even worse pinch point upstream or downstream, I’m a big fan of that book by Eli Goldratt called The Goal, which is all about bottleneck theory effectively, which says that in any system, that the performance of the system is usually constrained by its narrowest point. Now, that originated in what you might call manufacturing processes or chemical processes. He’s a, Goldratt was a hard-hitting physicist, you know, a serious guy, right? And then people realized that actually also applies upstream to demand. It’s not just a question of manufacturing and production. There is probably one thing, which is the single point at which it pays you most to intervene. Now, at which point, if you free up that bottleneck, a bottleneck may appear somewhere else. So you have a very weird thing which happens in, I think, the electric car market, which is the first bottleneck was there was huge demand for electric cars in the very early days from earlier doctors, techno geeks, etc. The bottleneck was you couldn’t produce enough cars, and so there were waiting lists. Then about 10 electric car companies came on stream with massive production of electric cars simultaneously, and the problem was there was a glut. Okay? So, you know, you literally have those issues where, at any one time, where the bottleneck lies may actually change. And therefore, framing the problem, because it’s important to consistently kind of evolve as you are sort of solving one bit or reframing one bit. It might pop open another bottleneck somewhere else, I guess, is what we’re saying. sponsored message Absolutely, yeah. So what I’m saying is there’s no point in widening a road if there’s a badly phased set of traffic lights 200 yards further on. All you do is you move the traffic jam somewhere else on the road, and you don’t actually increase the throughput of cars at all. So Rory, let me ask you a question. So let’s bring this down into your world in Ogilvy or in terms of what you’re doing. Can you give us an example or just sort of maybe it would help if you could kind of show us, say maybe where you got a brief through or something through where there seemed to be problem A, but by reframing it, re-exploring it, it changed the outlook and changed the outcome of the project. So Say Mate to a Mate, which is a campaign for the Mayor of London, which created a lot of controversy. And actually the controversy was interesting because a lot of people said that by proposing a relatively small intervention, we were making light of a problem. Okay, but let me explain the logic here. We did huge numbers of interviews with people in the kind of target audience. And what we found is that it was designed to effectively diminish or provide a reasonable solution to what you might call male-on-female misogynistic bullying. Okay. Now, what emerged from that is that that kind of behavior where people are casually misogynistic, either in the presence of women or in their absence in some cases. Okay. Most men don’t like it, but they didn’t have a mechanism for criticizing it in their friends without coming across as holier than that. Without coming across as patronizing, because what you can’t do if your friend engages in casual sexism, some shape or form, most men don’t support it, don’t agree and regard it as bad behavior, but you can’t suddenly read out a Guardian editorial, okay, to your friend because your friendship has an inherent value. Quite often, we tolerate quite a lot from our friends because that’s what friendship means. And so the whole idea which embraced, for example, comedians talking about it, it embraced a whole lot of a poster campaign, it embraced every form of medium suitable was actually involved in this. Okay. Now, I think it’s particularly important because you could argue it’s a version of broken windows theory. Look, it’s not going to stop. This campaign is not going to stop Fred West, okay? It’s not going to stop Peter Sutcliffe in his tracks, okay? But you could argue that those behaviors start somewhere and they start small before becoming bigger and bigger. And so the whole point about MATE is it’s a form of censure or criticism, which doesn’t actually make the person you’re criticizing. It doesn’t actually, effectively, it’s a corrective. It’s an internal corrective from a group of friends who would prevent that. Because some of that misogyny is probably performed for bravado, okay? They think they’re impressing their friends and their friends aren’t actually impressed. And so it’s interesting because some people said, no, no, no, we need to spend the money on street lighting. Well, arguably, everything starts somewhere. But secondly, the whole point was, it was very interesting that two people who supported it, I think, were, interestingly, Piers Morgan and Caitlin Moran, were two people who said, I get it, that works to me, that makes sense. And actually, two people who, whether you like them or not, I think are astute. You can say whatever you like about those two people. But they’re highly astute and they’re not formulaic thinkers. They will actually take a completely kind of a bleak opinion on things. They were two people who actually supported the campaign. The people who disliked the campaign were people who effectively felt that the only solution to any problem had to be head-on. And actually, human psychology, in many cases, keep off the grass is not a very effective communication. You know my story about, please turn off your mobile phone on entering the restaurant. We immediately think of reasons why it shouldn’t apply to us. Whereas the brilliant restaurant in Santimedia, which had a sign ostensibly aimed at people leaving the restaurant, but actually visible to everybody walking in, which said, please remember to turn your mobile phone back on when leaving the restaurant. By effectively suggesting a social norm rather than by imposing a rule, okay? The emotional response to that message, although both of them are in service of the same aim, the emotional response to the message is completely different. Now, you know, if you’re a hardcore person who says the only way to stop people turning their mobile phones on, okay, is by a direct instruction. Or an economist would say you have to fine people, okay, for using mobile phones. But actually, there’s a perfectly gentle way of doing this, which is just to say that if your mobile phone goes off during the meal, you know, in this fancy restaurant, or, you know, it might be considered a bit of a faux pas by the rest of the diners. And therefore, it’s a question that you’re actually, the notice is saving you from embarrassment rather than issuing an edict. And consequently, our emotional response is very, very different, even if the ultimate intent of the message is exactly the same. So going back to that brief for the mayor of London, then, how did that go then? You know, I know it was controversially received, but like, do you know of the data of the outcome of that campaign? I will seek to find out. It will take time because that’s, that’s one of my criticisms I will make about one of the problems working in direct marketing and one of the problems about this false claim of quantification we’ve made about marketing is a lot of the value of marketing takes time to emerge. Definitely. It’s exponential. The value of fame, for example, is really a compounding effect. It’s more like a pension. You know, as you become more famous, it becomes easier to become more famous. Okay. So these things are not linear and they’re not immediate, but we will measure it as far as we possibly can. By the way, I mean, you know, we ought to remember that there are some things which are very difficult to measure. If you obsess about the speed of measurement, and it’s worth remembering there’s a double problem there. Things you can measure very fast tend to be acquisition focused, bottom of the funnel. Okay. And because you can measure them fast, you get results very fast and the level of attribution is very precise. Any investment in customer service is likely to be slow and less attributable. Consequently, one consequence of this is that almost all companies, I would argue, that are obsessed with justifying their own existence in the marketing department are over invested in acquisition and under invested in customer experience, loyalty and retention and repeat purchase. Right. Because it goes back to that point you were making earlier that if you’ve experienced a train ride and you’ve know that that’s going to take some time. So, you know, yeah, absolutely right. It takes time for them me to get on the train and then have a couple of turns on that. I have a good experience. Then I, you know, tell someone else about it and then start actually planning that into my behavior going forwards. It does take behavior change takes time. Yeah, absolutely right. Yeah. And so it’s slow, you know. And so if you think about it, any significant behavioral change involves someone, A, in the early days, it involves people breaking with a habit and doing something altogether unfamiliar. And B, doing something which other people aren’t doing. Now, there is an interesting issue, which is sometimes called crossing the chasm, which is there is a group of people in any particular field who love doing things that other people aren’t doing. But there are a minority of people and they aren’t necessarily where the market value lies. And so you could argue that this very early group of people who are obsessed with buying electric cars, who were both novelty seekers and very high on openness, and to some extent perhaps slightly more individualistic. They want to stand out rather than fit in. Okay. Those people create an early ground swell of uptake for electric cars, which then doesn’t cross the chasm into the mainstream in part sometimes because the user imagery of early adopters might be quite strange. Okay. So a classic case of that was you had early people who bought Apple Vision Pro, okay, who then started walking around the streets of Manhattan wearing an enormous pair of goggles. It happened apparently famously with Google Glass. They only gave Google Glass out to developers. So the earlier adopters became known as glass holes. And what you need to do is you need to mainstream something. And sometimes the enthusiasts who are your first customers are actually in some ways almost negative ambassadors. Interesting. So how do we do that then, Rory? How do you mainstream something in that regard? I suppose you’ve got to normalize it somehow, haven’t you? Yeah. I mean, okay, with electric cars, one of the things I’ve made this point repeatedly in the hope that the industry picks it up, it’s a lot easier to reduce anxiety than it is to increase range. You know, increasing range, you’re dealing with the laws of physics, which are quite difficult to, I mean, there are wonderful ideas in chemistry and battery chemistry, which I’m sure can further increase the energy density of batteries. I’ve got no doubt about that. And indeed, it’s worth spending billions and billions of dollars looking for exactly those ideas. But at the same time, it’s a lot cheaper and quicker just to make people with a car with a range of 170 miles, say, or even 120 miles, stop feeling so goddamn anxious. So how do you do that? Well, two obvious ones. There are more, okay? One of them is you reduce any legal restrictions within reason on signage directing people to electric car chargers. So if you need planning permission to put up a sign that says car charging, okay? That’s a problem because electric car chargers are literally only 5 percent as visible as petrol stations are. There are actually more rapid chargers. By the way, Jacob, slight apologies for this because I accept the fact that in Australia, or in certain parts of Australia, this situation is different, okay? Because Australia is what geographers technically call very, very big. In fact, I think you’re in the 30 countries in the world with the lowest population density, aren’t you, in Australia. So you have massive cities separated by enormous distances. You know, that’s like the US similarly, Canada similarly, okay? I accept the fact that what I’m saying, so I’m just going to, you know, but in the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium, okay? High density population countries that are, you know, relatively small in size. Range anxiety is, I think, a virus we’ve caught from the United States, where it’s a rational fear out there. It’s not really a very rational fear in the UK at all. Because, I mean, apart from the else, in the US, they need 100 and I think that the statistics I went and found is, in the UK, we’ve got eight and a half thousand gas stations to serve a population of 60 million. And in the US, they’ve got about 350 million people, which is five times as many. They actually have 116,000 gas stations. And the reason is they need gas stations to serve a geography, not just a population. With the possible exception of the far north of Scotland, there’s no where really in Britain where you’re 50 miles from a place of major habitation. Okay, I mean, literally, there’s, you know, there are still black spots, by the way. I mean, those need to be ironed out. But one of the things would be you can just go to Android Auto or Apple CarPlay and just say, can you just add for anybody driving an electric car, a little panel that says nearest high-speed charging five miles ahead. Next, three available out of five, you know? Okay, just continue to reassure people. The other thing is you don’t need the bloody battery to say, your battery charge is 87%. Okay, I do need, when I get down to 11% charge, I need individual digits. 80% plus would be fine. I don’t need to be made conscious of the fact that I’ve lost a bit of juice when I’m at 80% already and I’ve just taken the kids to school. I don’t need that to factor into my thinking any more than I did when I had a petrol gauge. Yeah, because petrol gauges don’t give you the percentage, do they? No, it’s just three-quarters full, full, half full, eight full, the light’s gone on. That was it. That was the level of granularity we needed. There are lots of ways in which you can stop. The other one, by the way, is very simply, I hate to say it, but if you have extended test drives for electric cars, people can basically get addicted because once you’ve driven one, you’d have going back to petrol field stupid in a weird way. Nothing to do with environmentalism, by the way. In fact, I think the environmental message might have actually set back electric cars by five to 10 years because a lot of people interpreted them as an unfortunate compromise that was being forced on them by tree huggers, rather than the first major step forward in automotive traction in 90 years.

Get on the waitlist now at joinbba.com. Now back to the show. Yeah, Rory, everything you said here resonates because I bought an electric car a couple of years ago and have experienced all of these things, just the… What did you buy, by the way? What did you get? It was a Polestar. So, yeah. They’re very good. I hired one of those in Italy. I thought they were excellent. We had a good fun. And yeah, we have a petrol car as well. And going back to that, it’s like you don’t want to go back. And it’s just sluggish, loud. It’s like, why would you? I mean, the thing that happened was interesting, is the intention was always, I’ll get an electric car, my wife will get a petrol car, so we’ve got one of each. And then basically, once I got the electric car, we liked it so much, we ended up with two electric cars. Her car is Mini, it’s a Mini Cooper electric. It’s only got a range of, it’s one of the earlier ones, so it’s only got a range of about 110 miles, slightly less in cold weather. But actually, for all practical intents and purposes, it has proved that has been an issue, i.e. the need to recharge en route happens about once every, twice a year, something like that, no more than that. Yeah, I’ve only charged it once on the road and I’ve had it for a couple of years. I’ve never really experienced it. But actually, by the way, I think the government and various people unfairly vilified hybrid cars, because they didn’t understand the fact that the hybrid, for someone who’s an Australian, the plug-in hybrid, I mean, is not a bad thing because 99 percent of your journeys are taken care of by plugging in and getting 50 miles, 60 miles of range. I mean, sometimes the great is the enemy of the good. That’s another issue I’d raise with things like, an example of that would be heat pumps. People come to you and say, we’re going to have a perfect heat pump solution. Now, and I go, well, look, if I can reduce my gas consumption by 70 percent, and it costs me 4,000 pounds and I can do it one stage at a time. Okay, that’s pretty good. Okay, I’m not Greta Thunberg, but I’m doing a bit and it’s all in the right direction. What that probably means is I install four air conditioning units, which you mostly use as air to air heat pumps. I don’t know if you do that in Sydney. If it gets cold in Sydney, do you reverse your air-con so it warms the house? Yeah, we do. Yeah. Now, it’s actually a super-efficient fan heater, probably when it’s super hot outside, sorry, when it’s super, actually in Sydney, it’s going to be perfect. It’s not going to be that cold outside, right? It’s not like Canada, okay? Actually, it’s like a five times efficiency fan heater. So it probably takes in two kilowatts, it could be producing eight, okay? Something like that, okay? When you reverse your air-con. Now, in the UK, we don’t get any subsidies for installing air-con, even though my father, in his nineties, he was a bit frightened of a heat wave, understandably, because they kill you in your nineties. You know, if you can’t cool off, it’s really, really risky. So we bought him, my brother and I bought him an air conditioning unit for his main room. He didn’t want one for his bedroom or anything like that. Actually, because he’s actually in very hot weather, he’d sleep downstairs where the air-con was, right? One air conditioning unit. Now, you don’t get a subsidy for that because they go, oh, no, because you might use it for air conditioning and it’s actually creating new energy consumption. Mate, he lives in Wales, right? Okay. Heat waves in Wales are going to be about five days of the year at most, maybe 10, 95 percent of the time, my dad was using that air conditioning unit as an incredibly efficient way to heat his main room. As a consequence, he had a gas heater in the room, which he never used. Great. Well done, dad, okay? But no, because it’s not perfect, and because for five days of the year, he was committing the absolute sin of being a 90-year-old using air conditioning to stay alive. Okay? Right? So these people are not looking at this problem holistically. And so you have this problem. I think there are some areas of activity where we should be increasing carbon consumption. For example, if you can produce steel using coal to produce the blades for a bloody, you know, obviously, they’re not steel. Okay. But, you know, what I mean is to produce the blades for wind power. And that’s the best way of producing wind turbines or the belt, you know. There are cases where we should be perfectly happy with carbon use. Okay. The UK has already done really quite well. I mean, I think we’re just beating ourselves up now. We do have a major problem with this, don’t we, in the UK? We do beat ourselves up loads. And this is a major topic for international listeners in the UK around steel, because all are still working on closing down in the name of green energy. But the problem is, is then we still we haven’t all agreed to not still use steel. So we’re importing it, which therefore is actually, I mean, I’m not an economist by any stretch of the imagination. But my understanding is, it’s actually causing more of a problem with the carbon footprint, importing it all. So we kind of shot ourselves in the foot kind of thing with this. Also, the legislation is such a blunt instrument compared to marketing, because the great thing about persuasion is that you’ve got a good reason not to be persuaded. You can ignore it, right? Legislation or economic incentives impose themselves on people who should not be affected by them. This is my great argument for marketing as the first port of call for problem solving. So let me give you an example of this. If you are a retired person who’s got an 11-year-old petrol car, which is reasonably economical, okay? And about three times a week, you drive to the shops, and once a year or twice a year, you drive to see your cousin at Christmas, you know, or whatever, you know, 120 miles away. But your annual mileage is like 1500, 2000 miles. You should not be in any way encouraged to buy an electric car. Because a battery that could be used by someone who’s actually driving 10,000 miles a year, namely me, is now sitting outside a cottage somewhere in the middle of the country. Okay? Doing absolutely soddle for 99% of the time. So the fundamental point is that, I’ll give you an example of this. It’s a good idea to put, for people to put their tumble dryers, washing machines on late at night, because there’s less pressure on the grid. So the electricity produced at 11 o’clock at night is probably cleaner. Although there are other arguments, it can be Sunday lunchtime. But let’s not worry about that. Okay? Now, if you say it’s a good idea to do that, do that if you can. Lots of people who find it easy to do can do it. Everybody else goes, well, as it happens, I can’t do that. Now, the first thing, if you create like really expensive, becomes really expensive to use your tumble dryer, okay, until 10 p.m. or 9 p.m., okay? The first call you’ll get if you instigate that legislation is from the London Fire Brigade, who will say, people who work nights will now feel compelled to put their tumble dryer on and leave it in an unoccupied house, where they are a not irrelevant fire risk, okay? Tumble dryers catch fire, particularly old ones, particularly the least economical ones, okay? They catch fire. Secondly, you’ll be encouraging people who live upstairs, their kitchens upstairs from their next door neighbors’ bedroom, to put their washing machine on at 11 o’clock at night, so it hits the spin cycle at two o’clock in the morning and their neighbors come and beat them up, okay? The great thing about persuasion is if you’ve got a good reason not to be persuaded, you ignore it, okay? That’s why persuasion is organic and legislation and economics tends to be physics, okay? Right? One of them is organic change, the other one is kind of what you might call Newtonian change. Input here, output there. And actually the only way we’re going to solve this problem is organic change unless you’re happy to live in a country which is literally so oppressive that you spend 30% of your time doing utterly stupid things because you’ve got no choice. This is what you’re talking about, unintended consequences, isn’t it? You know, in all of these things, you’ve got to think that through across everything. And I think this is really important, because I think there’s an awful lot people can do voluntarily. I mean, there are a whole lot of things about solar panels, okay? Okay, now, I imagine you’re in Sydney. Someone in Germany has obviously got this right in some way, because Germans are using solar panels all over the place. Okay? Now, one of the things you could simply do, okay, is simply describe the value of solar panels to people who have investments using the language of APR. Okay? Now, admittedly, it’s not a compound effect, but if you spend a thousand pounds on solar panels, and they save you 18% of the amount you spend is saved on an electricity bill every year, there’s not much in the stock market at the moment that’s going to give me a guaranteed 18% return in terms of a dividend, right? Okay? So if you basically say this is an investment with a really good dividend, and actually a lot of pensioners who can, now in the UK, you can take a lump sum out of your pension tax-free, and arguably 10% of this, one of the things I say is actually you can take a further 10% out of your pension tax-free if you spend it on renewable energy. And then you’ll get a load of oldsters, often in big houses, which they are effectively saying, okay, that’s actually a way I can make my pension go further, is basically by not having to spend very much on electricity, on heating. Right. And they do that voluntarily, you’d imagine, rather than by… Yeah, but it’s still voluntary. So incentives, by the way, incentives can be voluntary. We’ve got to be careful about that. Okay. Because an example would be, nobody… We’ve got a housing crisis. There’s a very reliable bit of data which shows that nobody downsizes voluntarily, unless they do it by the age of about 72, 73. Once people hit 73, they just stick in their house, for whatever reason. Even if their house is much too big for them, even if logically they know they should move. And I think there’s a reason for that. I think when you’re 73, you’re not confident enough in your future health to say, well, if I move now, I’ve definitely got another eight years in my smaller house. You think, oh, I might spend all this cost of moving, all the cost of moving, and then I’ve got to move into sheltered accommodation three years later. I can’t be bothered. I’m going to eek it out as long as I can. Okay. Now, probably what you should say is that if you have a couple with nobody else living in the house and they downsize when both of them are below the age of 74, you should say, no stamp duty, okay? If you’re buying a less expensive house and you’re selling a more expensive house, then basically you’re excused stamp duty on the new house you’re buying. And then you say, but there’s a window of opportunity, which is if you leave it until you’re both 74, windows closed. Now, that’s an acceptable, okay, it’s not a nudge because it is actually an economic incentive, okay? But it’s an economic incentive being used to its maximum psychological effect. Rory, can we switch gears and talk about the future a little bit? You know, AI is a hot topic, so let’s dive into that. So like AI and data-driven tools, they’re taking over marketing is like heavy lifting. So where do you see human reframing adding the most value brands? Okay, this is the first time I’ve said this, but I’ve been thinking about this a bit over the last few weeks. Now, this already happened in the UK in the 18th century with the Industrial Revolution and the capability to mass produce things at scale at vastly low expense. So the pottery industry, for example, or operated historically a bit like Fabergé eggs. You went along, you said, I’m an immensely rich person, and I would like to commission an egg. And Fabergé would go and produce an egg, and hopefully you said, ooh, Carl, that’s a really lovely egg, and then you pay him a stack of money for it. Or you might argue about the egg for ages and go, no, that’s not the egg I meant at all, go and make another fucking egg. Right? Now, when Wedgwood, and it’s worth noting that the Industrial Revolution sort of started in things like pottery and textiles, you know, in other words, you know, but the mass production of both furniture and pottery. So Chippendale, in the case of furniture probably, Wedgwood, that was when modern marketing was invented because you suddenly said, well, we can produce so many effing plates. There’s no point in us waiting to be asked. What we have to do is produce a load of plates in advance and go out and find if anybody wants them. Okay? You reverse the direction of travel. Now, it occurs to me that in creative agencies, what we should do if we’re using AI correctly is we say, we can now generate interesting interventions and ideas and effectively mock them up to a high level of finish, much, much faster than we could previously. Now, we will still need judgment. It wasn’t that Wedgewood just produced random plates. Okay? They had very, very good designers who went and produced a very good plate design, usually based on some Chinese theme. Okay? And then bang them out in huge quantities. And then you made more of the ones people liked and less of the ones people didn’t. I would argue that the ad agency, the creative agency is still operating like Carl Fabergé. They’re waiting to be asked. They’re waiting for a client to come along with an RFP. They’re waiting for clients. And the reason I partly started the behavioral science practice is I said, look, the fundamental problem of this business is nobody’s got a budget for a problem they didn’t realize they had. And so a large part of what we do in Ogilvy Consulting, I would argue, is diagnostic. And actually, in nearly every case, we find something a business is doing, that if they just stopped doing it or did more of something else, they would be much better off. I think we’ve got to change the whole way the ad industry works, so that you actually produce advertising campaigns and ideas and ads and everything else. You produce them and then you find a market for them. I think we’ve got to reverse the direction of travel, because otherwise, if we’re still waiting to be asked, all we’ve done is commodify ourselves, okay? No one’s going to pay us any more money because they go, well, look, we know you can do this in three days, so why should we pay you for 15 days work, okay? It’s going to be a fucking disaster unless we actually reinvent what we do, and that requires a fundamental creation of a different kind of ad agency. Now, that’s one possibility. The second possibility is even more extreme, which is that when everybody you’ve ever met or had any commercial contact with can generate enormous amounts of sort of mere content at almost nil cost, then the competition for individual human attention, when you remove that level of friction that was involved in content creation, simply becomes intolerable to all consumers. The only way you do it is you do an advertising agency backwards, which is the consumer appoints an advertising agency to keep them informed of interesting and stimulating things. And so you reverse the direction of travel, which is it’s the consumer appointing an agent on agentic AI to go and look for goods and services, rather than the goods and services looking for the consumer. Love that. And I can see now that that actually, to some extent, goes back to the early days of the Internet when it was predicted, but never happened, OK, with things like the Clutrain Manifesto, written by Doc Searles, markets the conversations, OK, was one of the, was effectively one of the sort of axiomatic points made in, in the Clutrain Manifesto. And there was a prediction a long, long time ago, using a phrase which I haven’t read in print or pixels for 5 or 10, 15 years, the infomediary. In other words, it’s an agent, an informational agent operating at the behest of the buyer, effectively, looking for people who might sell to it, rather than the seller looking for people who might buy from it. That reminds me of something, Rory. So these days, there’s agents on job boards. So you’d hire an AI agent to go find an agent. So it’s getting quite meta rather than a person. It’s kind of what it reminds me of. They will be having conversations with other agents, I suspect. And then the whole question. I mean, it’s a strange thing if you think about it with the property market, that the property market only works in one direction. Typically, there are exceptions. You can appoint a buyer’s agent, and that happens at the level of very rich people. Okay. Just before we close, Rory, question. If somebody is building brands, thinking through a problem and listening to this podcast, what would your top three tips be to somebody in that state where they’re grappling with something? What would you recommend for folks to think about? I’m thinking three quick fire tips from Rory on problem reframing. The first thing is stop talking about what a brand is and talking instead start talking about what it can do. Because one of the problems I think and one of the reasons I think we undervalue brands. And Matt Johnson, who wrote a book called Brands Mean Business, a fantastic book, he’s a neuroscientist. His phrase is, having a great brand means you get to play the game of capitalism on easy mode. In other words, people inherently trust you more, people are happier basically making an impulse purchase from a brand than they are from someone they’ve never heard of. People are happier working for that company, people work longer and probably for less money for that company, that company that embellishes people’s CVs. When the company CEO rings somebody else up, they return his call. So a brand has an effect in lots and lots of ways, which I think grow, by the way, exponentially with brand fame. Okay, and we shouldn’t be afraid of simply saying a large part of branding is being famous. It can be being niche famous or it can be being broadly famous. Depends on what kind of business the brand exists to serve. But the first point I make is that one of the things I think we tend to do is we tend to have a very Newtonian approach to investment in brands, which is we define what the brand activity is supposed to do very narrowly, and we then measure the value of that activity only to the extent that it obtains the objective we defined in advance. So all other positive spinoff benefits of that investment in branding, of which I would argue there are almost certainly many, okay, all of those get lost because we’re defining in advance what we want that this thing to do. We also, I would argue, also tend to measure the value of a brand relative to competing brands, okay, Samsung versus LG, okay, when the real value of a brand consists in having a brand at all, okay. So all of you, both of you, I think, if you went to buy a television and there was a television from Samsung or LG, you would pay a couple of hundred bucks more for that television than you would from a television from a brand you’d never heard of, right? Equity, yeah. Just because they’ve got reputational skin in the game, you know, they have more to lose from selling a bad product. They have, you know, they are reputational fragile. There’s a limit to how bad any of their products can be. You know, I bought lots of things from Samsung. Some of them are good. Some of them are very good. Never bought anything from Samsung that’s terrible, right? Okay. Now, all of those things effectively allow you to command a fairly significant premium in the marketplace. But what we’re doing is you’re often comparing one brand versus another competitor brand, whereas, of course, the real value of the brand consists in the fact that you are actually famous, okay? A lot of that is hard. It’s harder to measure the effect that a brand has on price premium versus sales. So, you know, in many cases, we’re looking for brand value and completely the wrong place. But the other thing is, don’t ask what a brand is, ask what it can do. And actually, then you realize that you can use your brand in multiple ways, okay? And I would actually argue, there’s a very, very astute guy who is called Dale Harrison on LinkedIn, who’s a B2B marketer and an absolute genius, in my opinion. And one of his points is, it’s completely wrong to measure marketing investment on the basis of ROI. Yeah. He says, there are lots of areas of business expenditure which you engage in. So he said, if you were building a factory and someone said, we need to put a roof on the factory to stop the machinery getting wet, nobody would say, I need you to give me the ROI on the roof, okay? It is just a necessary component of whatever it is you do. Okay. And consequently, this ROI thing, we effectively thought, wouldn’t it be great? Wouldn’t it make our lives so much easier as marketers if we could actually quantify the value of everything we did? Well, unfortunately, the downside of this is that in the act of quantification, we’re almost certainly undervaluing or misrepresenting the value of everything we do. And we made it impossible to do anything that you can’t measure. Back to my initial point about direct marketing, you’re never allowed to do anything you couldn’t quantify. Yeah. And so you go, hey, I think it would be great. Okay. I think it would be great if we sent our customers a birthday card or a Christmas card. How will we measure the effect on that? Well, you could measure the effect on it. Obviously, you could take 50% of your customers and not send them a birthday card and see if there was any. One very interesting thing, which I don’t think has been experimented with nearly enough, by the way, is there’s a small business I buy from in Kent, occasionally buy clothes from. And I suppose I’m quite a regular customer of theirs. And at Christmas, they literally sent me just a box of goodies. It was probably 20 or 30 pounds worth of goodies. Now, to be honest, if I’m being really cynical, it might have been stuff they weren’t going to sell or they weren’t going to sell very quickly or whatever. But it was nice stuff like water bottles. And actually, you know, I gave some of it to my kids. I kept some of it myself. Now, it occurred to me that I don’t know if they’re testing that to see what effect it has. But it’s interesting to me that one thing I would like to test for a lot of brands is an act of fairly extreme generosity. Now, obviously, it has to make economic sense over time, okay? But if that means I order four times from that brand every year rather than twice from that brand every year, they’re in quite a high margin business, to be honest, okay? It’s sort of relatively expensive clothing or things of that kind. Then actually, that 30-pound investment, which to me was the most amazing bit of marketing I’ve received in about, you know, 10 years, is actually not particularly expensive. You know, it occurs to me that the finance people are going to hate this idea. I think there are a whole load of things in marketing which we’ve never tested that might really, really work. And the reason we’ve never tested them is not because they don’t work, because it’s too hard to prove that they do, or too slow to prove that they do. Yeah, yeah, it’s a major… We are obsessed with ROI, aren’t we? Absolutely, in this game. Okay, the other thing is we’re obsessed with data, but as Roger Martin says, there’s no data about the future. And strategy fundamentally is about the future. Definitely. There’s data which is indicative of possible futures, okay? But there’s no data about the future. And so this quest for certainty and our obsession with avoiding ambiguity and avoiding being in a state of uncertainty and ambiguity is really, really critical because everybody effectively in business now is involved in an arse-covering exercise under the guise of rigor, to be honest. We’re back with the dragons. Yeah. Yeah, we are. Yeah. Brilliant. Well, look, I know time is virtually up, Rory, and I just want to thank you personally for… It was great. We met last year in Manchester, and it’s so kind of you for agreeing to come on on our little show. Final kind of question, if folks want to connect more with you, understand more about your thinking, follow you in any way, like how can we digest Rory Sutherland’s content? Where do we go to? I mean, YouTube appears to be the repository for most things. TikTok is also searchable if you want short form at me. I also write an article, Fortnightly and the Spectator, which I’ve done for about 15 years. So if you go to spectator.co.uk, you can search by author and you’ll have effectively, two hardback books worth of various spectator writings over the last 12 or 13 years, quite heavily on behavioral science and technology. Because the interplay between them obviously fascinates me because when you think about it, okay, the most interesting thing you can imagine about the mysteries of psychology is, a company as rich as Apple and as intelligent as Apple, can produce the Apple Vision Pro, okay, and literally launch it with absolutely no idea whether the thing is going to be popular or not. Now, I would argue that the only answer to that question of what is, you know, and by the way, I have a very, very interesting take on a lot of those technologies, which is, if you read a book by Andy Clarke called The Experience Machine, his hypothesis is that most of what we perceive is a prediction, and we simply use our optic nerves and our auditory function and smell and everything else to revise for prediction error, okay, very much like a JPEG, you have an expectation value for each pixel, and you only use data to the extent the pixel differs from the expectation value, okay? And that means you need much less bandwidth to actually construct a view of the world, okay? Because you don’t have to look at everything in raw mode, afresh every millisecond. You can’t, it’s impossible, right? It’s impossible, impossible. You couldn’t process it, it’d be a totally inefficient use of bandwidth and data, okay? So instead, we’ve got a JPEG, Consciousness is an SNMPG, you know, at some level, okay? By the way, I think that probably explains why magic works, by the way, magic tricks, why they work. It also, there are some other wonderful demonstrations of things which, there’s a particular sort of noise, which is totally like white noise, until you put the text underneath and then you can hear the whole sentence, okay? You know, it explains Mondagreens, you know, how you mishear. Have you ever heard, it’s a Brenda Lee and it’s a Christmas song, and almost everybody British hears the lyrics as, Later, we’ll have some f***ing pie and do some caroling. It’s actually pumpkin pie, but my hunch is that because British people aren’t really familiar with pumpkin pie, we actually hear, I don’t know whether there’s a transatlantic difference in terms of that mishearing, but it’s a prediction, right? What we’re perceiving is a prediction, right? And so sometimes you want, sometimes I would argue, you want to optimize for surprise and sometimes you want to optimize for predictability depending on what you’re trying to do. But what was I going to say there? Oh yeah, that once you understand that, you’ll have to look at what we do differently, fundamentally. The reason I bring that back to Apple Vision Pro is I don’t think 3D vision is actually much of a thing. I think most of the 3D-ness in our environment, if you close one eye, okay, it’s not like you lose that much perception about your environment. I’ve now got my right eye closed. My right eye is a bit f***ed anyway because I had a detached retina. But with my right eye closed, I can perfectly well see where things are placed in relative. I wouldn’t be very good at putting a pen top back on close. And I probably wouldn’t be great at catching certain cricket balls because of that. I’m not saying that 3D vision is irrelevant. I’m saying it doesn’t play that bigger part in our perception. And consequently, actually, I think augmented reality, I think they need to… If you notice, 3D cinema becomes a thing about every 35 years. And that’s because a generation grows up who’s never learned to find it uninteresting. And then it becomes a novelty and then it dies off. And 35 years later, someone else goes, we’ve got to do this 3D. Now, there is an Apple thing called Google Starline, Project Starline, which is 3D video conferencing one-on-one, which is interesting because it may have psychological effects where it’s less tiring, whatever it may be. I don’t know. But my argument is that 3D is just not that big a deal in terms of human perception. And actually in a weird kind of way, we don’t want it. And I think the only way to understand that is understanding Andy Clarke’s notion that it gets into really deep stuff like free energy principle, which I don’t know what to think about. I can’t understand it. But ultimately, I think Andy Clarke’s book is really accessible and it makes its case very, very well. Amazing. Amazing. Brilliant. Well, look, Rory, thank you so much for giving up your time for coming on. We really appreciate you. I would also add to your comment that folks should get this book, Alchemy, which Rory has written and it’s fantastic, full of amazing insights around behavioral science and these sort of weird, quirky things that we all do and, you know, irrationally, but actually there is some rationale behind it. No, no, no, there is. Once you understand what the person is trying to do. Once you get it, yeah. The point is, we don’t always understand what we ourselves are trying to do. So it feels irrational, but there is rationality. Absolutely. So get hold of that book. And Rory, I guess that just leaves us to say thank you and have a lovely rest of your day. Absolutely.

From AI-generated art to chatbots in customer service, every sector is seemingly poised for disruption. It’s not just in your news feed every day – venture capital is pouring in, while CEOs are eager to declare their companies “AI-first”. But for those who remember the lofty promises of other technologies that have since faded from memory, there’s an uncanny sense of déjà vu. In 2017, it was blockchain that promised to transform every industry. Companies added “blockchain” to their name and watched stock prices skyrocket, regardless of whether the technology was actually used, or how. Now, a similar trend is emerging with AI. What’s unfolding is not just a wave of innovation, but a textbook example of a tech hype cycle. We’ve been here many times before. The tech hype cycle, first defined by the research firm Gartner, describes how emerging technologies rise on a wave of inflated promises and expectations, crash into disillusionment and, eventually, find a more realistic and useful application. Recognising the signs of this cycle is crucial. It helps in distinguishing between genuine technological shifts and passing fads driven by speculative investment and good marketing. It can also mean the difference between making a good business decision and a very costly mistake. Meta, for example, invested more than US$40 billion into the metaverse idea while seemingly chasing their own manufactured tech hype, only to abandon it later. Read more: Why the metaverse isn't ready to be the future of work just yet In 2017, blockchain was everyone’s focus. Presented as a revolutionary technology, blockchain offered a decentralised way to record and verify transactions, unlike traditional systems that rely on central authorities or databases. US soft drinks company Long Island Iced Tea Corporation became Long Blockchain Corporation and saw its stock rise 400% overnight, despite having no blockchain product. Kodak launched a vague cryptocurrency called KodakCoin, sending its stock price soaring. These developments were less about innovation and more about speculation, chasing short-term gains driven by hype. Most blockchain projects never delivered real value. Companies rushed in, driven by fear of missing out and the promise of technological transformation. But the tech wasn’t ready, and the solutions it supposedly offered were often misaligned with real industry problems. Companies tried everything, from tracking pet food ingredients on blockchain, to launching loyalty programs with crypto tokens, often without clear benefits or better alternatives. In the end, about 90% of enterprise blockchain solutions failed by mid-2019. Fast-forward to 2023, and the same pattern started playing out with AI. Digital media company BuzzFeed saw its stock jump more than 100% after announcing it would use AI to generate quizzes and content. Financial services company Klarna replaced 700 workers with an AI chatbot, claiming it could handle millions of customer queries. The results were mostly negative. Klarna soon saw a decline in customer satisfaction and had to walk back its strategy, rehiring humans for customer support this year. BuzzFeed’s AI content push failed to save its struggling business, and its news division later shut down. Tech media company CNET published AI-generated articles riddled with errors, damaging its credibility. These are not isolated incidents. They’re signals that AI, like blockchain, was being over hyped. There are three main forces at play: inflated expectations, short-term view and flawed implementation. Tech companies, under pressure from investors and media narratives, overpromise what AI can do. Leaders pitch vague and utopian concepts of “transformation” without the infrastructure or planning to back them up. And many rush to implement, riding the hype wave. They are often hindered by a short-term view of what alignment with the new tech hype can do for their company, ignoring the potential downsides. They roll out untested systems, underestimate complexity or even the necessity, and hope that novelty alone will drive the return on investment. The result is often disappointment – not because the technology lacks potential, but because it’s applied too broadly, too soon, and with too little planning and oversight. Like blockchain, AI is a legitimate technological innovation with real, transformative potential. Often, these technologies simply need time to find the right application. While the initial blockchain hype has faded, the technology has found a practical niche in areas like “asset tokenization” within financial markets. This allows assets like real estate or company shares to be represented by digital tokens on the blockchain, enabling easier, faster and cheaper trading. The same pattern can be expected with generative AI. The current AI hype cycle appears to be tapering off, and the consequences of rushed or poorly thought-out implementations will likely become more visible in the coming years. However, this decline in hype doesn’t signal the end of generative AI’s relevance. Rather, it marks the beginning of a more grounded phase where the technology can find the most suitable applications. One of the clearest takeaways so far is that AI should be used to enhance human productivity, not replace it. From people pushing back against the use of AI to replace them, to AI making frequent and costly mistakes, human oversight paired with AI-enhanced productivity is increasingly seen as the most likely path forward. Recognising the patterns of tech hype is essential for making smarter decisions. Instead of rushing to adopt every new innovation based on inflated promises, a measured, problem-driven approach leads to more meaningful outcomes. Long-term success comes from thoughtful experimentation, implementation, and clear purpose, not from chasing trends or short-term gains.
