(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs, a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren’t usually made in the U.S. It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, setting the stage for a likely tech stock rally on Monday. Recommended Videos U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won’t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere. It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. “We’ve been making a lot of money,” he said. "It’s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.” It is not clear how long the exemption will last or if separate tariffs will be negotiated on the various products. The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president’s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration’s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What’s more, It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump’s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broad this time, triggering a meltdown in the market values of Apple and other technology powerhouses. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech’s “Magnificent Seven” -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the combined Magnificent Seven’s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. Some of the losses eased this past Wednesday when Trump paused the tariffs outside of China, paring the lost value in the Magnificent Seven to $644 billion, or a 4% decline, from April 2. The electronics exemption also should relieve consumer worries that the China tariffs would result in hefty price hikes on smartphones and other devices that have become essential tools of modern living, It’s the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech’s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden’s administration’s and help propel an already booming industry to even greater heights. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump’s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move takes off “a huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,” said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. “President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops," Leavitt said in an emailed statement. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia and these companies are "hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.” Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

Title: Tax Breaks: The Week That Turned Out To Be A Wild Ride Edition

ByKelly Phillips Erb ByKelly Phillips Erb, Forbes Staff. The week was a rollercoaster for investors. The big news this week was the stock market. U.S. stocks tumbled as traders grappled with the consequences of President Donald Trump's tariffs. The S&P 500—a stock market index tracking the stock performance of 500 leading companies in the U.S.—which hit a record high on February 19, dropped quickly on Tuesday, the second-fastest such drop in history (lagging only behind the drop due to Covid). Stocks powered back after Trump announced a 90-day reprieve on most tariffs but dropped again. By the end of the week, investors felt like they had motion sickness after one of the most volatile periods on record for Wall Street. Losing money inside your brokerage or retirement account may hurt—but it doesn’t necessarily mean a loss for federal tax purposes. Markets go up and down—it's the nature of the beast. When the market goes down, that doesn't equal an actual or realized loss for tax purposes. Similarly, when the market goes back up, that doesn't equal a real or realized gain for tax purposes. For tax purposes, gains and losses aren't determined moment to moment or from those highs and lows, but how much your cost basis has gone up or down from when you acquired the asset to the disposition of the asset. To realize a gain or a loss for tax purposes, you must do something with the asset. Typically, that means that you sell it or otherwise dispose of it. (The tax rules can be more complicated for day traders.) Things were equally as hectic at the IRS. A Treasury announcement confirmed that Melanie Krause, the acting commissioner of the IRS, was leaving her position. The announcement followed the news that the tax agency agreed to share immigrant tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Under the agreement, the IRS will verify the names and addresses of immigrants provided on tax records to ICE. It's unclear what other information may be provided by the IRS. However, an initial lawsuit suggests it could include information about dependents and other personal information. Krause stepped in as acting commissioner in early March following the retirement announcement of Doug O'Donnell. O'Donnell had served in the role for just a few short weeks following former IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel's departure on January 20, 2025 (one week before the tax season officially kicked off). O'Donnell's departure on February 28 marked a remarkable 39-day span of rotating commissioners. Krause becomes the fourth commissioner or acting commissioner to leave the agency in less than 80 days. The IRS is also bracing for more cuts in its workforce. Thousands of agency employees are expected to receive pink slips in mid-May, about a month after Tax Day, April 15. About 11,000 cuts are predicted, bringing the total loss of employees in the first half of 2025 to 20,000. With a few days left before Tax Day, cracks are showing at the IRS. Millions of taxpayers are expected to file their federal income tax returns by the end of the day on April 15, 2025, with millions more expected to file for an extension. It's not the ideal time for mistakes to appear on the IRS website, but that's precisely what is happening. Potentially confusing errors are popping up on the site, including one that impacts taxpayers filing for an extension. Specifically, the extension payment date for taxpayers who log into the IRS website is incorrect. While payment should be made by April 15, 2025, taxpayers who log in to pay see an April 22, 2025, due date. The site says, "Your payment is due on April 22, 2025, regradless of filing for an extension." (Yes, the 'regradless' typo is on the IRS site, too). Multiple other errors appear on the site, including misidentifying the amended tax form as Form 104X (it's Form 1040X) that was recently “filled” instead of “filed.” The mistakes prompted Wendy Marsden, a CPA and author, to quip on BlueSky, “This is feeling like the website is spoofed and your payments will go straight to Russia.” It would be funny if it weren’t true. The timing raised eyebrows so close to Tax Day. It’s not clear when the changes were made—so far, there's been no answer. However, on Wednesday, Elon Musk tweeted on X (formerly Twitter) that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) had made a fix to the IRS website. Multiple tax professionals and some groups have reached out to the IRS. The IRS confirmed that it was investigating. As we look ahead to next week, here’s hoping it’s not quite so exciting. Don’t forget to file your return—or request an extension—by April 15, 2025. Check back with Forbes early next week for a list of deals and specials to make the day a little less taxing.

You can definitely pay your taxes with a credit card—either online or over the phone. But should you? That’s more complicated. I’m generally not a fan of replacing one kind of debt with another. But if your ability to pay is a timing issue—as opposed to an "I absolutely don’t have it at all" issue—it can make sense to use a credit card to pay off your tax debt. The IRS accepts all major credit cards (American Express, Discover, MasterCard, or Visa). To make a payment, head over to the credit card payment page on the IRS website and choose one of the payment processors to pay online or by phone (if you're paying by credit card and using e-file, your options are here). The IRS doesn’t charge a fee for credit card payments. However, third-party credit and debit card providers may charge a fee, which may vary by provider, card type, and payment amount. Applicable fees for credit cards range from 1.75% to 2.95% (minimum fees apply)—that’s in addition to any fees or interest that your bank may charge. High-dollar payments—those over $1,000,000—must be coordinated with the service provider (you may also need a new tax preparer, just saying). Paying by credit card is a good option if you know you can pay the bill off eventually. Plus, you might earn miles or points to help you book a trip to somewhere amazing to lessen the pain of paying your taxes. That’s the plus side. On the not-so-plus side, credit card interest and other fees can add up, so if you know you won't be able to pay off the balance, consider other options, like an installment agreement with the IRS. An installment agreement lets you pay what you owe over time. Depending on how much you owe, you won’t even have to speak with a real person—if you owe $50,000 or less in combined individual income tax, penalties, and interest, you can apply for an installment agreement online. (If you don’t qualify for an online installment agreement or if you want to apply for an installment agreement by mail, use Form 9465.) Fees apply. Keep in mind that it's cheaper if you sign up online and even less expensive if you agree to pay by direct debit. Other options may be available, too. If you are insolvent or unable to pay due to circumstances beyond your control, the IRS will work with you. Give them a call at 1.800.829.1040 or use the phone number on any notice that you might have received in the mail. — Do you have a tax question or matter that you think we should cover in the next newsletter? We’d love to help if we can. Check out our guidelines and submit a question here. IRS numbers from the tenth week of the tax filing season—the week ending April 4, 2025—suggest that taxpayers are finally ready to file their tax returns. The data shows that the IRS received 101,422,000 individual income tax returns as of April 4, 2025, compared to 101,849,000 as of April 5, 2024. The dip is just .4%, with 427,000 fewer individual tax returns filed to date in 2025 compared to 2024. Most of those returns were e-filed. In 2025, the IRS received 98,184,000 e-filed returns, compared to 98,421,000 in 2024. That’s a drop of .2%. Of those, the IRS reported that it received 53,392,000 individual income returns e-filed by tax professionals and 44,792,000 self-prepared e-filed returns. Tax season data for week ending April 4, 2025 Most tax professionals will e-file your return—not only are some required to e-file (a 2010 requires specified tax return preparers to e-file certain federal income tax returns), the IRS says that e-filing is more secure and more likely to be accurate. As National Taxpayer Advocate Erin Collins put it when recommending e-filing: "Paper is the IRS' kryptonite." While a few weeks ago, the number of e-filed returns prepared by professionals was nearly neck and neck with the number of self-prepared e-filed returns, tax professionals now have the edge. Taxpayers with simple returns often e-file early, while those taxpayers with more complicated returns tend to rely on their tax professionals to file. The IRS began the e-file program in 1986 as a pilot project in three cities: Cincinnati (Ohio), Phoenix (Arizona), and Raleigh-Durham (N.C.). That year, there were 25,000 tax returns filed electronically. Last year, the IRS received 151,781,000 e-filed individual returns. Tariffs are already making an impact. Admit it: You haven’t heard about tariffs this much since freshman U.S. history. But with tariffs on again/off again this week, it’s all that many business owners were talking about. (You can find a quick primer on tariffs here.) One of the motivations behind the tariffs is revenue. Peter Navarro, a senior White House trade official, projected that tariffs announced since January would generate about $6 trillion to $7 trillion over 10 years. That would generate enough revenue to fund an extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and some of Trump’s campaign promises, such as tax-free tips, overtime, and Social Security benefits. However, according to a new Tax Policy Center estimate, the tariffs will generate far less tax revenue than the administration claims. TPC estimates Trump’s taxes on imported goods would raise about $3.3 trillion from 2026 to 2035, plus an additional $190 billion for the remainder of 2025, roughly half of Navarro’s prediction. Of course, that was before the pause. That–and raising import taxes on Chinese goods–would cut in half the amount of revenue Trump’s April 2 levies could increase, according to a new TPC analysis. TPC found Trump’s latest plan would raise about $1.7 trillion for the 10 years from 2026 through 2035, plus an additional $125 billion for the remainder of 2025. The analysis assumed that Trump’s latest tariff policy would be permanent, although he said his newly announced delay would last only 90 days. It also assumed the President would eliminate his “reciprocal” import taxes but continue his 10% tariff on worldwide trade and maintain higher tariffs on many goods from Canada and Mexico and on products such as steel, aluminum, and autos and auto parts and raise tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%. Trump has suggested that the tariff revenue could replace income tax revenue. Earlier this year, he mused that the IRS could be replaced by the External Revenue Service, a new government agency that could be established to oversee the collection of tariff revenue. While abolishing the IRS and eliminating income taxes may sound good to some taxpayers, the practicality of fully replacing tax revenue with tariff revenue is very complex. And while most of the current tariffs–and revenue raisers–are focused on China, tariffs targeted to Canada have raised eyebrows. Trump has suggested that there’s an easy fix, writing on Truth Social, “The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First State. This would make all Tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear.” Those comments have rankled Canadian politicians, including Canada’s new prime minister, Mark Carney, who said, “The old relationship we had with the United States based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation is over. It’s clear the US is no longer a reliable partner.” And while it’s easy to dismiss the back and forth as political grandstanding, this isn’t the first time Americans have weaponized tariffs. In the late 19th century, President Benjamin Harrison’s secretary of state, James G. Blaine, had a plan: By saddling Canadian imports with heavy new tariffs, the United States could force Canada to seek American statehood. Will history repeat itself? (Spoiler alert: The 1890 tariffs didn’t result in Canada becoming what would have been, at the time, the 45th state.) 📅 April 15, 2025.

The tax agency says that more than $1 billion in outstanding refunds remain unclaimed from the 2021 tax year. The agency estimates that more than 1.1 million taxpayers might have qualified for a refund but did not file a federal income tax return to claim it—you have until April 15, 2025, to file and claim your money. The IRS reminds self-employed individuals, retirees, investors, businesses, and corporations that April 15 is the deadline for first-quarter estimated tax payments for the 2025 tax year. In a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) and Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) commended the leadership of these two Senators on behalf of American businesses and employees through the introduction of the bipartisan Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Simplification Act of 2025. This bill provides uniformity for nonresident state and local income tax withholding and a reasonable de minimis exception from assessing state and local income tax in a jurisdiction where an employee does not reside. The IRS has published Internal Revenue Bulletins 2025-15 and 2025-16. Law firm Sullivan & Worcester announced that Cameron N. Cosby has joined the firm’s REITs and tax practices as a partner in the Washington, D.C., office. Previously with Fried Frank, Cosby brings over 35 years of experience with tax aspects related to real estate investment trusts (REITs), partnership transactions, and mergers and acquisitions. Remember last week when I wrote that Italy believed they could tax social media? Lawmakers in Minnesota think so, too. Key Minnesota Democrats on legislative tax committees want popular social media platforms to pay tax on the use of consumer data. Under the bill, large companies with more than one million users in the Gopher State would pay $165,000 per month plus $0.50 per person on the sites, while those with fewer than 100,000 users would not pay any tax (those in between would have varied rates). Facebook, owned by Meta, is considered to be the largest social media platform in the world—with over 3.049 billion monthly active users globally. YouTube is the second most used social media platform, with around 2.49 billion monthly active users. — If you have tax and accounting career or industry news, submit it for consideration here or email me directly.

LUCK, TX - MARCH 17: Willie Nelson performs in concert during Luck Reunion on March 17, 2022 in Luck, Texas. (Photo by Gary Miller/Getty Images for Shock Ink) In the 1980s, Nelson was hit with a staggering $16.7 million tax bill, thanks to his involvement in tax shelters. It was one of the largest individual federal income tax bills ever generated by the IRS at the time. The debt was negotiated to a mere $6 million by Nelson's lawyer, but Nelson still didn’t have the money to pay. On November 9, 1990, the feds raided Nelson's home, taking everything he owned except Trigger, Nelson's favorite guitar, which he had his daughter, Lana, take out of his home in anticipation of the raid. "As long as I got my guitar," Willie Nelson said, "I'll be fine." The IRS auctioned off some of Nelson’s belongings but didn't dent Nelson's bill. So, the two sides reached a rather unusual compromise: Nelson would release a compilation album and would share the proceeds with the IRS. The album, “The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?,” was entirely written by Nelson and performed using—what else?—Nelson's trusty guitar, Trigger. It was the first (and maybe only) record album ever released under a strict revenue-sharing agreement with the IRS. The album, which could be purchased by dialing (800) IRS-TAPE, retailed for $19.95. The IRS only collected $3.6 million from the sales of the album. However, by that time, Nelson had settled his lawsuit with Price Waterhouse (whom he had blamed for his tax woes in the first place), and with other projects in the works, Nelson paid off his debt. An IRS spokesperson said about the deal at the time, “We try to work with taxpayers… And if we have to come up with some creative payment plan, that's what we're going to do because it's in everyone's best interest.” How did we do?

Title: Big Tech cozied up to Trump — it’s not getting much in return

The US has put Meta, Apple, Tesla, TikTok, and others in a tough spot. The US has put Meta, Apple, Tesla, TikTok, and others in a tough spot. by Alex Heath For a while, it looked like President Donald Trump was going to have Big Tech’s back. Now, the tech industry is collateral damage in his global trade war. On Thursday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen floated the idea of placing “a levy on the advertising revenues of digital services” if tariff negotiations with the US go south. This would be the opposite outcome that tech CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg were hoping for when they threw their support behind the new administration. To someone like Zuckerberg, Trump was supposed to be the strong-armed leader to bring the overbearing EU to heel. Instead, the rhetoric between the US and EU is ratcheting up just weeks before the EU is already set to fine Meta (and Apple) for violating its Digital Markets Act. While certainly more of a self-inflicted wound, Elon Musk’s popularity in the US has “inverted as his support for President Trump has increased,” Nate Silver wrote this week. Tesla’s stock price, meanwhile. has lost over a third of its value this year, and, thanks to tariffs, the company has removed the option to buy new, US-made vehicles in China. As I predicted last week, TikTok is particularly screwed by Trump’s extra-aggressive China tariffs, which the country has promised to “fight to the end.” Even as it’s still business as usual for TikTok’s rank and file, the app’s fate in the US feels increasingly precarious. When asked this week about the extended deadline to reach a TikTok deal in the US, a spokesperson for China’s commerce ministry said the government “opposes practices that ignore the laws of the market economy, plunder by force, and damage the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises.” “There’s not going to be much dialogue until that’s resolved,” one of TikTok’s aspiring bidders, AppLovin CEO Adam Foroughi, said this week of the tariffs. The situation is such a mess that the US stock market tanking also “drowned out the ability to infer feedback” from shareholders about AppLovin’s bid, Foroughi told Bloomberg. If anything, this week is a reminder that the tech industry has grown so large and influential that its leading companies are tools for leverage between countries. In times of relative peace, that influence can be beneficial for Big Tech. When things get hostile, Big Tech is put in the crosshairs.

Hoka The Hoka Clifton 9 is one of our gear editors’ favorite shoes for both walking and long days of standing. You can score the women’s Clifton 9 for 20% off in nine colors on Hoka’s site right now. Or browse Dick’s Sporting Goods and REI if you’re looking for a different size and color combo—it’s on sale for the same discount at all three stores. Hoka Sturdy and springy, this sneaker was recently updated with a bouncy foam midsole and ultralight design that make it ideal for everyday runs. This discount is available at Hoka in four colorways and at Zappos in five. Hoka Inspired by southern California’s Solimar beach, this sleek sneaker offers neutral stability, mid-level cushioning and an extended heel—perfect for daily training. Three colors are currently on sale, though the colorway pictured above has the most sizing available. Hoka If you want a sneaker that can transition from the pavement to the trails, this Challenger design is on sale in six colors direct from Hoka. The redesigned sneaker offers more height than its previous iteration, a plush midsole and a grippy lug tread to keep you from slipping when you’re off-road. Hoka Designed with professionals in mind, the Hoka Bondi SR is for people who spend most of the day on their feet, like restraunt workers and nurses. The shoe features a plush sole, water-resistant leather and a slip-resistant outsole. This discount is only available in the pictured colorway, but sizes 7.5 through 11 are in stock.

Zappos The Kawana is a great transitional sneaker that you can wear at the gym or running errands. It has a low-profile aesthetic, a breathable mesh upper and an internal bootie for a more secure fit. This discount is only available in the pictured colorway but it’s the best price you can find for this sneaker online. Hoka rarely offers sitewide sales. That said, its sale section is often stocked with older designs for 20% to 40% off. You can also typically find deals on Hoka sneakers from third-party retailers like REI and Dick’s Sporting Goods. Yes, select Hoka styles have been awarded the podiatric APMA Seal of Acceptance. This means podiatrists have reviewed the shoes and agreed that a number of Hoka’s cushioned designs are beneficial to overall foot health. Our editors named the Hoka Clifton 9 sneaker the best cushioned walking shoe for women and the best men’s walking shoe for flat feet. The style is plush and supportive without feeling overly bulky. But they won’t work for everyone—the best walking shoe for you depends on a variety of factors, including how high your arches are and how you walk. For instance, we recommend skipping the Hoka Clifton 9 if you have especially narrow feet. The brand recommends replacing your Hokas between 250 and 500 miles, depending on individual wear. Pay attention to signs like increased muscle fatigue, uneven wear patterns and discomfort to identify when it’s time to trade in an older pair. Hokas have been popularized online for their outstanding comfort and support. They have a super-plush midsole that helps with shock absorption and stability without weighing you down. They also come in a variety of bright color combinations to suit most styles and preferences.

Title: Wall Street Rallies After Trump Says He Is ‘Open to Talks’ With China on Tariff Deal

Apple continues to rebound from the $1 trillion that was slashed from its market cap following the president’s new tariff plan Another day, another wild trading session, with all three major stock indexes jumping more than 1.50% on Friday. The strong close to a whiplash-inducing week comes after a few more twists in the ongoing U.S.-China tariff battle, with White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt saying the Trump Administration was “open to talks” with China on trade deals. Leavitt’s comment came hours after China increased its tariff on American goods to 125% on Friday — a move that followed President Trump raising the tariff on Chinese imports from 104% to 125% to 145% this week. “We are doing really well on our TARIFF POLICY,” the president posted soon after the markets opened on Friday. “Very exciting for America, and the World!!! It is moving along quickly. DJT.” The S&P 500 increased 1.81%, the Dow Jones climbed 1.56% and the Nasdaq jumped 2.06% on Friday. All three indexes are up more than 6% compared to where they started off on Monday, following brutal back-to-back days at close last week. Here is a look at how several prominent media and tech stocks performed: Meta: -0.50%Google: +2.59%Fox Corp.: -1.27%News Corp.: +2.34%Amazon: +2.01%Disney: -0.39%Comcast: +0.12%WBD: -1.60%Netflix: -0.31%Roku: +1.60%Snap Inc.: +1.66 Apple’s stock price, meanwhile, was up 4.06% to $198.15 per share. The world’s most valuable company had at one point this week seen $1 trillion shaved from its market cap following the president’s announcement of his “liberation day” tariffs on Apr. 2, but the company has climbed back in recent days. The company, led by CEO Tim Cook, is now down about $550 billion from where it was before the tariff plan, closing the week with a valuation of $3 trillion. Investors have been spooked because Apple assembles iPhones and a number of other products in China; the company recently flew in planes full of devices to avoid being hit by the new tariff on Chinese imports. Friday’s trading action was a fitting close to a rollercoaster week for the markets. Wall Street took a big hit on Thursday, one day after a historic rally on Wednesday, following President Trump’s announcement he was pausing his reciprocal tariff plan for 90 days on most countries so that deals could be made. Another important development on Friday was the Federal Reserve being “absolutely” ready to step in to help stabilize skittish markets, if necessary. The president and his team of financial advisors have said a stiff tariff on China is warranted, considering the country’s communist government rips off American businesses and their IP. President Trump has also said it is not great that a foreign adversary produces so many of the goods that are shipped into the States. “Hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable,” Trump said on Wednesday. The U.S.-China trade standoff has caused a ripple effect that has been felt across virtually every industry, including Hollywood. The China Film Administration on Thursday said it would “moderately reduce” the number of American films it shows moving forward. When it comes to how this will shake out, one Disney executive told TheWrap “We’re not panicking. We are waiting and seeing.”

April 11, 2025 13:28 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP APP Investors with Losses Encouraged to Contact the Firm SAN FRANCISCO, April 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On March 27, 2025, investors in AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) saw the price of their shares drop $65.92, wiping out about $20 billion of the company’s market value, after prominent short seller Muddy Waters Research revealed its short position in the stock. Muddy Waters’ report comes on the heels of a recently filed securities class action lawsuit, captioned Quiero v. AppLovin Corporation, et al., No. 4:25-cv-02294 (N.D. Cal.). The suit seeks to represent investors who purchased AppLovin securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Hagens Berman is investigating the claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Recent Development: On March 27, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a scathing report titled “AppLovin: Deep Data Analysis Shows APP is Just Another Scammy AdTech Company.” The report’s focus is in part on “retargeting” (a strategy that aims to re-engage potential customers who have previously interacted with a brand), “incrementality” (the additional or incremental lift in sales or conversions that a marketing activity generates), and AppLovin’s compliance with third party platforms’ TOS (terms of service). Muddy Waters contends that “APP e-commerce is Mostly Retargeting, Incrementality is Low, and it Clearly Violates Platforms’ TOS.” Muddy Waters alleges that: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Securities Class Action: The Muddy Waters report follows the filing of a securities class action complaint alleging AppLovin made false and misleading statements, while failing to disclose critical details about its flagship AXON 2.0 digital advertising platform. The company had heavily promoted the platform as "the best and fastest-growing product we’ve ever released." Investors were allegedly led to believe that the platform, which reportedly leverages “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would redefine the digital advertising landscape by enhancing ad placement efficiency and expanding into e-commerce and web-based marketing. However, the alleged narrative first shifted on February 26, 2025, when short sellers Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research published damaging reports that raised pointed questions about the company’s claims. Both research firms accused AppLovin of misleading investors regarding the platform's true capabilities and ethical practices. Fuzzy Panda Research alleged that the company violated app store policies by exploiting user data in questionable ways, predicting that tech giants Apple and Google would ban AppLovin from their app stores. Additionally, they accused AppLovin of “stealing data from Meta” as part of its e-commerce initiatives, foreseeing swift retaliation from Meta. Culper Research criticized the company for allegedly using AXON 2.0 as little more than a promotional facade to obscure the real drivers behind its business strategy. Culper's report further claimed that AppLovin's growth in mobile gaming has relied on “systematic exploitation of app permissions that enable advertisements themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations onto users’ phones, with just a single click – an event that is often inadvertent thanks to the Company’s notorious UX gimmicks” and that “each illicit install translates directly to profit.” “We are investigating claims that AppLovin may have misled investors about whether its growth may be attributable to illegitimate conduct,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: Despite Zuckerberg’s Promises, Facebook ‘Fact Checkers’ Continue Censoring Information About COVID-19 Vaccines
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/facebook-continue-censoring-information-covid-19-vaccines/5884230
Time Published: 2025-04-11T15:41:45Z
Full Content:
In early January 2025 Meta announced that it would be scrapping the use of its so-called ‘independent fact checkers’ on Facebook and Instagram, replacing them with a ‘community notes’ system similar to that now used on Elon Musk’s X platform. Commenting on the move, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg admitted that the ‘fact checkers’ used by the firm had been “too politically biased” and that it was “time to get back to our roots around free expression.” Three months later, however, it appears not much has changed. Facebook posts made by users outside the United States remain subject to draconian censorship by anonymous ‘fact checkers.’ Having previously fallen foul of the Facebook censorship regime, we launched our new Dr. Rath Health Foundation page on the social media platform last month. Everything appeared to be fine until we posted a link to an article on our website describing how a June 2024 study authored by researchers from the Netherlands had analyzed data from 47 countries and found that over three million excess deaths have occurred in the Western World since 2020. Published in the prestigious BMJ Public Health journal, the study described this as “unprecedented” and, expressing serious concerns, urged governments to thoroughly investigate the underlying causes – including potential COVID-19 vaccine harms. Facebook’s response was not what we were expecting. Our post was quickly slapped with a ‘False information’ ‘Reviewed by third-party fact-checkers’ label. This was accompanied by a link to a webpage claiming that COVID-19 vaccines had supposedly actually lowered excess deaths. Reading further we learned that Facebook pages and websites “that repeatedly share false information will see their distribution reduced and their ability to advertise removed.” So much for Zuckerberg’s promises, then. Unusually, the study concerned had been widely reported in the legacy media. The UK’s Daily Telegraph newspaper even went so far as to openly state that COVID-19 vaccines may have helped fuel the rise in excess deaths, and that experts were calling for more research into side effects and possible links to mortality rates. Other legacy media covering the story included the New York Post, the Times of India, Bahrain’s Gulf Daily News, and the UK’s Daily Mail. Nevertheless, despite the BMJ Public Health journal having peer-reviewed the study prior to publication, it responded to the media coverage by saying that its ‘integrity team’ and editors were now “investigating issues raised regarding the quality and messaging” of the research. It isn’t difficult to guess what this means. Behind the scenes, in activities resembling those of the infamous ‘Ministry of Truth’ in George Orwell’s ‘Nineteen Eighty-Four,’ the paper is likely being watered down or considered for retraction. By labeling posts about the study as ‘false information,’ Facebook is essentially supporting such moves. Speaking in January 2025, acknowledging that there had been “too much censorship,” Zuckerberg committed himself to “restoring free expression” on Meta’s platforms. Getting rid of the ‘fact checkers’ and replacing them with a ‘community notes’ approach would start in the United States, he said. After that, the claimed plan – as described on the Facebook website – is to improve it over the course of the year before expanding to other countries. While we would like to believe that Zuckerberg is genuine, there are no published dates as to when the ‘community notes’ system will be expanded to countries outside of the United States. Nor are there even any guarantees that it will be expanded. Prohibitions on freedom of speech are not simply a matter of human rights. They are also a direct threat to our health. The coming months will show us where Zuckerberg really stands. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article. Follow us on Instagram and X and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

He provides a comprehensive analysis of everything you need to know about the “pandemic” — from the medical dimensions to the economic and social repercussions, political underpinnings, and mental and psychological impacts. “My objective as an author is to inform people worldwide and refute the official narrative which has been used as a justification to destabilize the economic and social fabric of entire countries, followed by the imposition of the “deadly” COVID-19 “vaccine”. This crisis affects humanity in its entirety: almost 8 billion people. We stand in solidarity with our fellow human beings and our children worldwide. Truth is a powerful instrument.” Reviews This is an in-depth resource of great interest if it is the wider perspective you are motivated to understand a little better, the author is very knowledgeable about geopolitics and this comes out in the way Covid is contextualized. —Dr. Mike Yeadon In this war against humanity in which we find ourselves, in this singular, irregular and massive assault against liberty and the goodness of people, Chossudovsky’s book is a rock upon which to sustain our fight. –Dr. Emanuel Garcia In fifteen concise science-based chapters, Michel traces the false covid pandemic, explaining how a PCR test, producing up to 97% proven false positives, combined with a relentless 24/7 fear campaign, was able to create a worldwide panic-laden “plandemic”; that this plandemic would never have been possible without the infamous DNA-modifying Polymerase Chain Reaction test – which to this day is being pushed on a majority of innocent people who have no clue. His conclusions are evidenced by renown scientists. —Peter Koenig Professor Chossudovsky exposes the truth that “there is no causal relationship between the virus and economic variables.” In other words, it was not COVID-19 but, rather, the deliberate implementation of the illogical, scientifically baseless lockdowns that caused the shutdown of the global economy. –David Skripac A reading of Chossudovsky’s book provides a comprehensive lesson in how there is a global coup d’état under way called “The Great Reset” that if not resisted and defeated by freedom loving people everywhere will result in a dystopian future not yet imagined.

Title: Wall Street Inches Higher Even as China Ups Its Tariff on American Goods to 125%

“We are doing really well on our tariff policy,” President Trump insists as media and tech stocks open Friday to mixed results After what has felt like a weeklong rollercoaster ride for most investors, Wall Street was off to a relatively tame Friday morning, with the three major indexes all modestly moving higher in early trading. The green morning comes after wild back-to-back days on Wall Street and after China raised its tariff on U.S. goods to 125% earlier on Friday. Still, President Trump showed confidence that the ongoing tariff battle with China — and the tariff negotiations with several other countries — was going to turn out OK in a Truth Social post soon after markets opened. “We are doing really well on our TARIFF POLICY,” the president posted. “Very exciting for America, and the World!!! It is moving along quickly. DJT.” His post comes the day after Wall Street took a big hit — which itself followed a historic rally on Wednesday, following President Trump’s announcement he was pausing his “liberation day” reciprocal tariff plan for 90 days so that countries could work out trade deals with the U.S. A half hour into trading on Friday, the S&P 500 was up 0.10%, the Dow Jones was up 0.04%, and the Nasdaq was up 0.14%. Here’s how a number of tech and media stocks are performing: Meta: -1.01%Google: +1.97% Fox Corp.: -0.59%News Corp.: +0.90%Amazon: +0.28%Comcast: +0.56%WBD: -3.40%Netflix: +1.66%Roku: -0.10%Snap Inc.: +0.32% Apple’s stock price was up 0.76% to $191.87 per share. The world’s most valuable company has had about $700 billion shaved from its market cap since the president announced his new tariff plan on Apr. 2. Investors have been spooked because Apple assembles iPhones and a number of other products in China; the company recently flew in planes full of devices to avoid being hit by the new tariff on Chinese imports. President Trump on Thursday raised the tariff on China to 145%. It will be worth seeing if any trade deals are announced on Friday — something that could give investors a bit more clarity heading into the weekend, compared to a week ago. President Trump on Thursday said he believes “we will be able to work out something that’s good for both countries” when discussing China. Check back after 4:00 p.m. ET to see how the day went for Wall Street.

Title: The 12 Best AI Video Generators for Your Business to Try
URL: https://www.webfx.com/blog/marketing/best-ai-video-generators/
Time Published: 2025-04-11T14:18:02Z
Full Content:
AI is all the rage these days. That’s not totally surprising — it’s a revolutionary leap in technology, from text generation to image creation. It hasn’t taken long for them to start entering the video space, too. Several companies have successfully developed tools that allow them to generate lifelike videos using AI, and marketers are taking an interest in harnessing the best AI video generators for their campaigns. If you’re among the businesses interested in this phenomenon, you might be wondering which AI video tool would be the best one to try out. If so, you’re on the right page. Below, we’ll cover the best AI video generation tools out there, along with some pros and cons of using them! P.S. Want more marketing insights from the experts? Subscribe to Revenue Weekly — our email newsletter — to get more helpful marketing info delivered straight to your inbox! Now that we’ve covered some of the most important things to think about when considering AI video generation tools, let’s talk about what those tools are. There are many options out there, but we’ve selected five of the best tools for you to consider. Those tools include: Price: 14-day free trial available, with paid plans starting at $19+ per month Best for: Quickly turning long-form content like blogs and webinars into short, shareable videos The first AI video generator tool on our list is Pictory. Pictory is one of the most widely used AI video generators out there. It offers different options for creating videos, but its core process is pretty simple. Basically, you upload a video script, and Pictory will put together a video based on the text in the script. It will do this by analyzing the words in the script and then sticking together a bunch of stock footage that relates to the words it finds. You can also add AI-generated voice narration over the video. Price: Free limited plan available, with paid plans starting at $18+ per month Best for: Creating professional-looking AI avatar videos with multilingual voiceovers. Synthesia starts out the same as Pictory — it has you input a text-based video script, and then it generates a video. But instead of throwing together stock footage, it uses an AI avatar, having that avatar read the script. These avatars are based on real people. You can either upload footage of real employees at your company and have Synthesia create avatars from them, or you can choose from a variety of premade avatars provided by the software. These avatars look fairly lifelike, though there’s definitely an element of the uncanny valley there. Price: Free limited plan available, with paid plans starting at $28+ per month (free plan available) Best for: Fast, template-driven video creation for marketers and social media managers. InVideo is yet another platform that lets you input text and generate a video based on it. You can also choose from a variety of different video templates, so you still have a degree of control over the look of your video. InVideo is particularly convenient for creating social media videos, since it lets you export to platforms like Facebook and Instagram directly from the tool. You can even input your target audience, and InVideo will tailor the video to that group of people. Price: Free plan available, with paid plans starting at $20+ per month Best for: Hyper-realistic AI voiceovers and avatars tailored to e-learning and explainer videos. Another of the best AI video generators is Synthesys. Don’t get this mixed up with Synthesia — despite the similar names, they’re different tools. However, they do offer similar features. Like Synthesia, Synthesys specializes in producing AI avatars who can read the scripts you provide. These avatars aren’t limited to speaking in English, by the way (even if the people they’re based on are!). You can provide a script in anything from Spanish to Japanese to Dutch, and Synthesis will be able to handle it — it advertises that it supports over 140 languages. Price: Free plan available, with paid plans startig at $24+ per month Best for: Generating news-style AI avatar videos with ultra-fast turnaround times. Next, we have Deepbrain AI. This AI video generator tool, like Synthesis and Synthesia, allows you to submit a video script and have it read by an AI avatar. Deepbrain doesn’t really come with any features that you won’t find in other tools on this list, but it’s another option if for some reason you’re not interested in using the ones listed above. In terms of pricing, it’s cheaper than Synthesis, but more expensive than the other three tools listed here. Price: $0.50 per second of video Best for: Cinematic, story-driven video generation with advanced camera movement and scene consistency. Google Veo 2 is Google’s advanced, AI-powered video creation platform. You can use this video generator to convert text to video for marketing, social media, company trainings, and more. If you want to make more artful videos, this tool is a great option. Veo 2 supports advanced cinematic features, like camera direction and shot framing, allowing you to create masterpieces for any project. Price: Included in Amazon Bedrock pricing plan Best for: Creating long-form, coherent AI videos with consistent visual storytelling. Amazon Nova was launched early 2025 as part of Amazon’s suite of AI tools. With Nova, you can create videos for your Amazon products, as well as custom images from text. Nova maintains visual consistency and style across scenes up to two minutes long. If you’re looking for a seamless, e-commerce focused platform, Nova can be a great choice. Price: Free Best for: Multimodal, personalized video generation combining image, video, and audio inputs. Meta Movie Gen allows Meta users to create visual elements for branded and personal use. As of April 2025, this tool is free to use for Meta users, meaning it’s a great option if you are familiar with Meta platforms. This generator goes beyond video — you can integrate video, image, and audio generation for personalized brand storytelling. Price: Free plan available, with paid plans starting at $9.99+ per month Best for: Generating immersive 3D video scenes directly from text prompts. Luma Dream Machine offers a unique approach to video creation. This tool converts your custom text prompts into dynamic, 3D-rendered videos for personal or business use. If you want to explore a new art style for your business or start adding interest to your website, this tool is an affordable, accessible option. Price: Free plan available, with paid plans starting at $25+ per month Best for: User-friendly, fast-turnaround video generation ideal for creators and entrepreneurs. Nex ton our list is Pollo AI, an emerging tool that has been noted as a user-friendly, impressive option for video creation. This tool enables drag-and-drop editing and real-time preview in a beginner-focused interface. If you are new to AI, video generation, or want sometime easy to use for one-off projects, Pollo AI might be your new best friend. Price: Free basic plan available, with paid plans starting at $8 per month Best for: Short-form, creative content, like music videos and stylized animations. Pika Labs is gaining popularity for intuitive interface and ability to produce engaging short-form videos efficiently. It allows direct animation of characters and scenes from text and image inputs, making it easy to add your branded language, colors, and mascots to personalized videos. Price: Free basic plan available, with paid plans starting at $12+ per month Best for: High-fidelity AI video generation with fine-grained control over motion and style. Finally, we have Runway Gen-3 Alpha, a leading-edge video generation platform known for its high-quality, cinematic outputs. Since it’s release, it has become widely recognized for pushing the boundaries of AI-generated video content. This tool offers precise motion and style control for frame-accurate, cinematic outputs. And, with the low price point, you can start creating videos and gaining traction online for your business without breaking your budget. Before you choose an AI video generator tool, it can be helpful to know the benefits and downsides to using one in your marketing campaigns. On the positive side of using AI video software, you have: Despite those benefits, there are some definite downsides to using AI video generators. For one thing, even the best AI-generated videos still ring false for many viewers — something will always feel slightly off. That makes your content feel less authentic and trustworthy. On top of that, AI avatars aren’t great at expressing personality. Their bodily movements are extremely limited, as are their facial expressions, so they can’t show off personality with expressive faces or hand movements. That makes it a lot harder to connect with viewers. Finally, if you use software-provided avatars, there’s a good chance you’ll end up using the same avatars as other companies that use that software. After all, there are a limited number of avatars in each tool. Some users could have an immediate, negative reaction to your content if you use an avatar they’ve already seen from other companies. Regardless of whether you choose to use any AI video generation tools, you’ll need to put in the work to ensure that your videos are optimized to drive leads and conversions. If you’re not sure how to do that, you’ll need to get help from a professional marketing agency. WebFX is the perfect agency to help you through your video optimization process.

Title: Dave Vellante’s Breaking Analysis: The complete collection

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / APRIL 11 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world.

Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations.

Title: Cheap things from China are poised to get pricey. Secondhand retailers are ready to take advantage | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Retailers are freaking out over tariffs. President Donald Trump’s tariffs, if enacted after the 90-day suspension, will impact some of the biggest textiles exporters, including Bangladesh, Vietnam and Pakistan. The United States Fashion Industry Association — a trade organization representing the interests of importers, wholesalers and major retailers from Urban Outfitters to Walmart — said its industry “depends on global supply chains more than perhaps any other sector of manufactured goods.” And the tariffs have come directly for fast fashion, which has become a major segment of the American clothing market in the past decade. Shein and Temu make up 17% of the discount US market, according to a congressional report on China’s e-commerce exports. The “de minimis exemption,” which allows packages worth less than $800 to enter tax-free into the United States, will be canceled for shipments from China starting May 2. The Trump administration has now implemented a tariff of 120% on those goods (or a “per postal item” cost of $100 starting May 2, which goes up to $200 on June 1). One retailer is celebrating, however. In a statement last week, online consignment and thrift store ThredUp said it “applauds” the closure of the de minimis exemption for China, saying it “provided an unfair advantage to fast fashion retailers.” “We believe that making fast fashion more expensive will incentivize consumers to choose… secondhand options” instead, said the company, which reported $322 million in annual revenue and 1.8 million active buyers in 2023. Chinese e-commerce sites such as Shein, Temu and Aliexpress have built their gargantuan business models around de minimis shipments. The relaxed restrictions and tax exemptions on cheap products allowed more than 1 billion packages to pour in at a low-cost price in 2023 for consumers looking for a deal on everything from clothing to household goods, the congressional research report said. Getting rid of de minimis could have major impacts on how Americans shop; 80% of total US e-commerce shipments in 2022 were de minimis imports, the vast majority of which come from China, according to the congressional research report. Fast fashion has taken over the retail industry. In this business model, the latest trends are quickly churned out at low prices, despite the environmental waste and often questionable labor practices. Fast fashion has gotten even faster thanks to retailers like Shein, Temu and Aliexpress. On these apps, customers are met with an algorithm of endless scrolling through inexpensive goods that can make it from warehouses in China to their doorsteps in a matter of a few days. Consignment and thrift store retailers like ThredUp promote the antithesis, which they call “slow fashion,” as they say the best way to get inexpensive items in the most sustainable and ethical manner is to simply buy secondhand. “Our supply chain, if you will, comes from the closets of American customers,” ThredUp Chief Strategy Officer Alon Rotem told CNN. He said the company had been lobbying Congress to eliminate the de minimis exemption for years, and he hopes to see a bill passed instead of relying on an executive order. For the first time, he said, slow fashion could have a chance at leveling the playing field against the behemoth that is fast fashion. In a March survey conducted with ThredUp and GlobalData of more than 3,000 people, nearly 60% said that if tariffs made clothes more expensive, they’d explore alternatives like the secondhand market. Some younger consumers already started doing that, even before the tariffs — almost 40% of Millennial and Gen Z shoppers had made a secondhand purchase online in the last year, the survey found. But young people are also driving fast fashion, and that’s because they also want more bang for their buck. “The number one overlap that we see with resale and with fast fashion is the concept of value,” Rotem said. But the tariffs might not have a life-altering impact on the resale market. Many fast fashion giants, such as H&M, have diversified their production and make clothes in countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh. Trump’s tariffs on those countries have paused for 90 days, and he has indicated his tariff plans are open to negotiation, though the US will now charge an extra 145% on all Chinese goods that arrive in the US. If tariffs remain at 10% worldwide, fast fashion retailers can absorb much of those costs, Poonam Goyal, a Bloomberg senior equity analyst for e-commerce, told CNN. Fast fashion brands that operate in the US “are going to actually do better under the de minimis exemption, because they now have a playing ground where they are not price disadvantaged by Shein and Temu bringing in rock bottom prices because they can escape the tariff duty,” Goyal said. It may take a few months to see the full impact of tariffs. Uniqlo’s Japanese parent company said in its earnings Thursday that the immediate impact of the tariffs will be limited because a significant amount of its stock is already in the US. Uniqlo sources its products from Vietnam, Bangladesh, Indonesia and India, along with China. And for sites like ThredUp, their competition isn’t Shein and Temu, but any full-priced retailer, Goyal said. Customers have no need for an even cheaper alternative to Shein, but instead are looking for deep discounts on items such as Lululemon leggings. The de minimis provision has been around since the 1930s, but the threshold has increased over the years. It’s meant to ease trade and help out consumers, Clark Packard, a trade policy research fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, previously told CNN. With the exemption, buyers don’t have to fill out tiresome customs paperwork or pay tariffs on small packages. In September 2024, the Biden administration announced it was cracking down on what it called “abuse of the de minimis exemption.” Americans are used to seeing Temu and Shein everywhere. China-based advertisers made up 11% of Meta’s revenue in 2024, up from 6% the year prior, according to the company’s financial reports. Bank of America estimated Temu and Shein could account for 2% to 4% of the ad spending on Google and Meta. Shein, Temu and other major Chinese sellers have already been trying to get ahead of this by opening backdoor factories in countries like Vietnam and Mexico, and Shein began bulk shipping to US warehouses as early as last year, Chris Tang, a professor of global supply chain management at the University of California, Los Angeles, told CNN. But consumers will soon have to contend with either higher prices or longer shipping times, he said. “Consumers pay the highest price,” Tang said. “(A) $3 or $4 t-shirt is not going to happen any time soon.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Is NVDA Stock A Bargain At $110?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. BATH, UNITED KINGDOM - JANUARY 29: In this photo illustration a smartphone screen displays the logo ... More for the app for Chinese AI company DeepSeek alongside the logo for the ChatGPT app on January 29, 2025 in Bath, England. (Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images) Question: Why would someone pay 30 times earnings for Microsoft stock (NASDAQ: MSFT) when Nvidia stock is available at 33 times earnings? It may not seem logical, especially when considering these three key factors: Although Nvidia may appear to be a “safe haven,” its historical performance during market disruptions suggests caution. During the 2022 inflation shock, NVDA plunged over 65%. In 2020, amid pandemic-driven uncertainty, the stock declined more than 35%. Most notably, it lost 85% of its value during the 2008–2009 financial crisis. So, NVDA doesn’t exactly qualify as a safe stock. Our dashboard How Low Can NVIDIA Stock Go In A Market Crash? offers detailed insights into how Nvidia has performed during and after past market crashes. Still, Nvidia’s stock has already corrected meaningfully, dropping from nearly $150 earlier this year to under $110 currently. Investors seeking a potentially more resilient alternative may want to explore the Trefis High Quality portfolio, a strategy that has returned more than 91% since inception, as shown by its HQ performance metrics. For investors who believe in the long-term growth of Artificial Intelligence, Nvidia could be a compelling choice at its current valuation. The company holds a crucial position as an “arms supplier” in the AI revolution. Investing in Nvidia is effectively backing the infrastructure that powers AI development across major companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon. As the AI boom is still in its early phases, companies continue to invest heavily in supporting infrastructure. For instance, Meta’s projected capital expenditures for tech infrastructure stand at around $65 billion—illustrating the magnitude of ongoing AI investments. Despite its attractive potential, Nvidia carries risks that should not be overlooked. Earnings may fall short of projections, and growth could decelerate from the current 50% rate to a more modest 30%, especially if firms begin conserving cash. There’s also a possibility that Nvidia’s clients will prioritize building more efficient AI models, reducing their need for an ever-expanding volume of chips. Moreover, unexpected developments can adversely affect the stock. Investors should be aware of the potential for a 40% drop in share price under adverse conditions. However, selling amid such a downturn could undermine long-term investment goals. Despite these headwinds, long-term investors with a 3–5 year horizon who are comfortable with market volatility may find Nvidia attractive at current levels. For those interested in strategies designed to navigate downturns, the Trefis Reinforced Value Portfolio has consistently outperformed a blended benchmark of all-cap stocks, including the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Alternatively, investors could consider consulting with an advisor experienced in bear market strategies. Staying calm and strategic during turbulent markets can lead to significant long-term gains.

Title: How's Apple going to get out of its China jam?

The tariffs are paused, except the ones that aren't. Which includes a whopping 145% for products shipped from China. What does that mean for Apple? Yes, lots of giant tech companies have deep ties to China, from Amazon to Meta to Tesla. But Apple is fully enmeshed in China, where it has spent years building up the supply chain for its iPhones, which are the company's core business. If those tariffs stay in place, that could jack up the price of an iPhone by hundreds of dollars. Maybe more. So now what? Spoiler: No one seems to know. (An Apple rep declined to comment; I haven't heard back from the White House.) But if you're an Apple optimist, you're probably wishing for one, or both, of these plans. After President Donald Trump's first election win, in 2016, Apple CEO Tim Cook basically wrote the playbook for business leaders hoping to stay afloat in Trumpland. He frequently engaged with Trump privately, never criticized him publicly, and was willing to play along when Trump wanted to use Apple as a symbol of Big American Companies That Are Coming Back to America. That included keeping mum when the president falsely claimed during his reign that Apple had opened a MacBook plant in Texas (the plant had opened years before, during the Obama administration). And that work paid off when Apple got exemptions from the China tariffs Trump enacted during his first term. Now Apple bulls are hopeful Cook will find a way to wriggle out again. They're especially buoyed by Trump's comments on Wednesday suggesting he'll give certain companies some kind of tariff relief. "Some companies, through no fault of their own, they happen to be in an industry that is more affected by these things than others," Trump said. "You have to be able to show a little flexibility, and I'm able to do that." On the one hand, it would seem much harder for Trump to give Apple a pass this time around, since his administration has consistently talked about getting Apple to build iPhones in the US. Exempting Apple from some or all of his tariffs makes that even less likely. On the other hand, Trump is consistently inconsistent. For instance, while it's engaging with China in a trade war and talking about the need for the US to stay ahead of China in the AI arms race, Trump's administration has reportedly given Nvidia its blessing to sell its top-of-the-line chips to China. Before that, Trump was reportedly set to halt those sales. Maybe Cook persuades Trump to give Apple a pass, or a partial pass. But in the meantime, Cook has been trying to give himself as much flexibility as possible, by reportedly shipping planeloads of iPhones — perhaps as many as 1.5 million units — from China and India to the US in advance of new tariffs. That would give him the ability to keep selling the current versions of iPhones at the same price, at the same profit margin, at least for a while. But then what? Apple usually unveils, and starts shipping, new iPhone models in the fall. It's almost impossible to imagine those getting made anywhere but China, no matter how hard Apple scrambles to find extra production capacity in lower-tariff countries, like Vietnam or India. And those 1.5 million older model phones wouldn't satisfy demand for a company that sells a reported 220 million phones a year around the world. And … that's kind of it, as far as options go. Note that there's no real consideration of Apple building up a brand-new supply chain infrastructure that's fully separate from China — certainly not in the short run to midterm. Meanwhile, even if you don't own an iPhone and/or never plan on buying a new one again, Apple's iPhone dilemma is probably still your dilemma. Even if you don't own Apple stock directly, you're almost certainly exposed to it because the $3 trillion company makes up a giant slice of the major stock indexes. As the journalist Patrick McGee notes: "If your retirement is invested in index funds, Apple is your single biggest investment." The fact that Apple's stock price dropped by only 4% on Thursday — compared with 7% drops for Meta and Tesla, and 5% for Amazon and Nvidia — suggests that investors feel reasonably confident that Cook can navigate this one. Maybe they're right. Then again, these are the same investors who were surprised by Trump's tariff rollout last week. I wouldn't feel confident about any of these outcomes. Jump to

Title: Market volatility order of the day as investors eye Trump’s next move

The unseasonably cold snap blasting much of North America is delaying the spring DIY sales boost toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker typically enjoys about this time of year. But the Connecticut-based maker of power screwdrivers to lawnmowers felt a harsher chill from Washington last week when Donald Trump unleashed tariffs on the rest of the world. Stanley Black & Decker may be better able to deal with the rapidly escalating trade war between the US and China than it would have been under Trump’s first presidency. “Seven, eight years ago, about 40 per cent of what we sold in the US came from China. And now we’re down to a number that’s closer to the mid-teens,” chief executive Don Allan told analysts on a call in January. It didn’t stop the company’s shares sliding 29 per cent over the course of 4½ days of trading following Trump’s April 2nd ‘Liberation Day’ speech. It made the toolmaker one of the worst affected stocks on the S&P 500 index as a violent wider market reaction wiped trillions off the value of shares globally and triggered gyrations across other financial markets. That was before the US president sensationally announced during lunchtime trading in New York on Wednesday (just after 6pm Irish time) that he would be putting a 90-day pause on most tariffs. Even though he has doubled down on China – levies on imports from there would rise to 125 per cent from 104 per cent after Beijing unveiled additional retaliatory charges earlier in the day – Stanley Black & Decker would not be denied participating in the biggest one-day Wall Street rebound since October 2008, jumping 15 per cent as the wider US market soared 9.5 per cent. [ White House says tariffs on China now total 145%Opens in new window ] While the relief rally spilled over into Asia and Europe on Thursday, selling pressure resumed as trading got under way again on Wall Street as markets waited for Trump’s next move. The market reaction seen for most of the past 10 days was “very different to anything we’d seen before”, said Aidan Donnelly, head of equities at Davy Private Clients. “Unlike, say, the financial crisis or Covid, this was self-inflicted.” Elliot Hentov, head of macro policy research at State Street Global Advisors, said stocks “would now require another positive trigger to take another leg up, while policy uncertainty continues to dominate market moves in coming weeks”. “The residual unknown would relate to whether US-China trade relations could improve within a reasonable time frame,” he said. The about-turn proved that Trump pays attention to the markets. But while the S&P 500 is usually the 78-year-old’s barometer of choice, it was the bond market that forced him to blink first in his game of chicken with what he had called “foreign scavengers”. Investors had initially piled into US government bonds – a traditional safe haven in times of market volatility – in the immediate aftermath of last week’s tariffs speech, sending the market interest rate – or yield – on its 10-year notes from about 4.2 per cent to below 4 per cent. However, the yield – which drives not only government borrowing costs but influences rates on new mortgages, credit card debt and business loans – spiked in the first three days of this week to as high as 4.5 per cent. This was an unusual move at a time when recession fears are mounting. It triggered a number of theories, ranging from investors dashing for cash to hedge funds being forced to sell to meet margin calls, and speculation that Chinese and Japanese investors – among the largest holders of US debt and worst impacted by Trump’s protectionist measures – were dumping US government bonds. Trump, who vowed over the weekend to maintain his hard line against the country’s trading partners even after stocks tanked, acknowledged on Wednesday evening the flashpoint that had spooked him most. [ US tariffs: Why Trump U-turned on his bombastic tariffs and what it means for IrelandOpens in new window ] “The bond market is very tricky, I was watching it,” he told reporters. “I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy.” His government needs to refinance trillions of dollars of debt in the next 12 months. The announcement of the 90-day moratorium suggests markets can probably eliminate worst-case scenarios, according to Barry Glavin, the Dublin-based head of global equities at Amundi, Europe’s largest asset manager. “However, it also means that uncertainty will continue throughout this period,” he said. “It remains unclear what a steady-state looks like in terms of the tariff regime the US will stick with. It also remains to be seen what retaliatory measures will be implemented.” Trump’s major reversal will see tariffs on nations that don’t retaliate against the US drop to 10 per cent, which aligns with his blanket tariff level on all imports. Before this, most imports from the EU were facing a 20 per cent charge. EU member states had only approved 25 per cent counter-tariffs on a wide range of US products earlier on Wednesday, including poultry, soyabeans and steel. These were suspended on Thursday. The seven days that followed Trump whipping out his tariffs chart in the White House Rose Garden saw shares globally – measured by the MSCI World Index – slumping more than 11 per cent and Wall Street’s gauge of market fear, the Vix index, spiking at levels last seen five years ago during the height of the Covid panic. Banking stocks bore the brunt of the sell-off in Ireland – with Bank of Ireland, AIB and PTSB sliding between 14 and 18 per cent, amid concerns about the fallout on Ireland’s open economy. Only hours before his volte-face, Trump was threatening to soon announce “major” tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals, which make up 60 per cent of Irish goods shipments across the Atlantic. In Dublin, too, the Central Bank upped its surveillance of Irish-domiciled funds holding €4.9 trillion of assets, making it the second-largest funds hub in Europe. [ EU hits pause on counter-tariffs in hope of US trade dealOpens in new window ] “Approximately €2.1 billion, or circa 43 per cent, of the total net assets of Irish domiciled investment funds are invested in global equities. The Central Bank has been closely monitoring data flows and engaging directly with various market participants in recent days, as is standard at times of heightened market volatility,” a spokeswoman for the regulator said. “We cannot comment on individual firms or the specifics of our supervisory engagements, but we continue to monitor for indicators of stress.” Over the seven days, the price of crude oil plunged by more than a fifth to less than $56 a barrel on recession fears; gold, a traditional go-to for investors in times of uncertainty, hit an all-time high of almost $3,168 an ounce before falling almost 7 per cent; and the premium that investors demand to hold debt of companies with low credit ratings, or junk bonds, spiralled at their fastest pace, relative to government debt, since the US regional banking crisis in March 2023. The cost of investors insuring against companies and sovereigns defaulting on debt on the credit default swaps market also moved higher. The turbulence was compounded by mixed messaging on the ultimate aim of the tariffs regime, with Trump and his treasury secretary Scott Bessent suggesting it would yield trade deals, while his top adviser on trade and manufacturing, Peter Navarro, insisted there was no room for negotiation. Dissent also crept into the upper echelons of Trump’s Make America Great Again movement. Elon Musk, head of Tesla and SpaceX, and Trump sidekick, distanced himself from the plan over the weekend when he suggested the US should enter a free-trade zone with Europe. He subsequently entered into a bitter public spat with Navarro, calling the protectionist former economics professor “a moron”. Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, a vocal backer of Trump’s presidential bid last year, urged the president to pause the tariffs, or risk “a self-induced, economic nuclear winter”. Ken Fisher, founder of Fisher Investments and a longtime Trump supporter since the 2016 campaign, went even further. He took to X on Tuesday to say the tariffs were “stupid, wrong, arrogantly extreme, ignorant trade-wise and addressing a non-problem with misguided tools”. What Trump unveiled Wednesday is stupid, wrong, arrogantly extreme, ignorant trade-wise and addressing a non-problem with misguided tools. Yet, as near as I can tell it will fade and fail and the fear is bigger than the problem, which from here is bullish. Musk and the other six CEOs of the so-called Magnificent Seven companies that had led the wider market higher in recent years – including Apple’s Tim Cook, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg, all flag wavers at Trump’s inauguration in January – saw tens of billions wiped off their combined net wealth as the values of their companies fell. “Speedy ‘deal’ announcements over the coming 4-6 weeks would be the most favourable (or least negative) outcome for equity markets, in our view, and remain our base case,” said Deutsche Bank equity strategists, led by Maximilian Uleer, in a report published even before Trump announced his U-turn. If the US had stuck to the tariffs announced last week, Deutsche reckons it would have shaved as much as 1.5 percentage points off US gross domestic product (GDP) expansion this year – suggesting the economy would barely grow. It would only have been a matter of time before equity markets priced in a potential recession in Europe, too, they said. There is a threat that the US will return to its original tariffs plan once the 90-day pause is over, even though Trump – who sees himself as the ultimate dealmaker – has significantly weakened his hand by caving in to market forces. For now, a unilateral 10 per cent charge on most imports remains. “Right now, we don’t know who will pay for them,” said Ipek Ozkardeskava, a senior analyst at Swissquote Bank. “Will exporters absorb the majority of the costs to protect their US market share? Or will exporters pass on the costs to US consumers?” Investors will be closely monitoring commentary from US companies as the first-quarter earnings season kicks off on Friday with banking giants JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo and investment group BlackRock reporting results and hosting analyst calls. While Davy’s Donnelly says market volatility may be the order of the day for the near term, he notes that investors with a long-term perspective have historically been well rewarded. The MSCI World Index’s 13 per cent decline so far this year compares to an almost 19 per cent advance over the course of 2024. The index is up by about 50 per cent from where it stood at the end of 2019. “In that period we’ve had a global pandemic, a massive swing in global interest rates and a trade dispute, and yet equities are up sharply,” said Donnelly. “If you were to be shown a chart in five years’ time depicting the performance of the stock market over 10 years, you probably wouldn’t be able to pick out [the current episode].” Joe Brennan is Markets Correspondent of The Irish Times Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Tech stocks give up some of Wednesday’s gains following tariff pause
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/04/10/tech-stocks-give-wednesdays-gains-following-tariff-pause/

UPDATED 17:36 EDT / APRIL 10 2025 by Maria Deutscher Numerous tech firms saw their shares tumble during today’s trading session amid a broader sell-off in stocks and cryptocurrency. The declines chipped away at the gains that public markets logged yesterday. According to a CNBC tally, Wednesday saw the heaviest trading volume on record: an estimated 30 billion shares changed hands before the closing bell. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 12% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 8%. The Wednesday rally came in response to President Donald Trump’s announcement that the U.S. would temporarily lower tariffs on all countries except China. With certain exceptions, duties will remain at 10% for 90 days. Tariffs on imports from China, in turn, are set to increase sharply. Stocks started giving up some of the Wednesday gains after today’s opening bell as investors digested the impact of the revised duties. The selloff accelerated after the Trump administration clarified that the tariffs on imports from China will be set at 145%, not 125% as investors previously believed. Around noon EDT, 2,562 of the stocks on the NYSE were in the red while only 163 were up. The S&P 500, which tracks leading stocks on not only the NYSE but also other exchanges, experienced a similar decline. About 80% of the companies in the index ended the trading day with their share prices down. Many major tech firms were among the affected stocks. Nvidia Corp. lost nearly 6% of its market cap while Microsoft Corp. closed 2.3% lower than the same time a day earlier. Amazon.com Inc. shares slid 5.1%. Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. experienced one of the biggest declines: its stock is down 6.7%. Investors may be concerned that the tariffs on Chinese imports may increase the company’s data center hardware costs. Meta’s advertising business may also be a factor: the Financial Times reported in February that China-based advertisers account for about 10% of the company’s revenue. Apple Inc., which makes most iPhones in China, saw its share price drop more than 4% today. Reuters reported today that the company has flown 600 tons of iPhones to the U.S. from India because it “wanted to beat the tariff.” Apple reportedly convinced local officials to reduce the amount of time its devices take to clear customs at a Chennai airport. Today’s selloff was also felt in the cryptocurrency market. Coinbase Global Inc. shares fell about 6% while the price of Bitcoin is down more than 3%. Other major cryptocurrencies, including Ether and Solana, experienced single-digit declines as well. During a Cabinet meeting this afternoon, Trump didn’t rule out the possibility of extending the 90-day tariff reprieve. “We’ll have to see what happens at that time,” he said. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that he expects the administration to be “in a place of great certainty over the next 90 days.” THANK YOU Defense Department scraps $5.1B worth of technology and consulting contracts At Next, Google Cloud makes a credible claim to lead the new era of enterprise AI Silicon photonics startup nEye raises $58M to light up AI data centers Amazon's Andy Jassy reiterates the need to spend billions on building out AI infrastructure Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines reportedly raising $2B in funding SentinelLabs exposes AkiraBot spam tool powered by OpenAI-generated messages Defense Department scraps $5.1B worth of technology and consulting contracts POLICY - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 8 MINS AGO At Next, Google Cloud makes a credible claim to lead the new era of enterprise AI AI - BY ROBERT HOF . 5 HOURS AGO Silicon photonics startup nEye raises $58M to light up AI data centers INFRA - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 18 HOURS AGO Amazon's Andy Jassy reiterates the need to spend billions on building out AI infrastructure AI - BY MIKE WHEATLEY . 19 HOURS AGO Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines reportedly raising $2B in funding AI - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 20 HOURS AGO SentinelLabs exposes AkiraBot spam tool powered by OpenAI-generated messages SECURITY - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 21 HOURS AGO

Title: ‘Rock Band’ With Your Hands: VR Game ‘Beatable’ Looks Incredible

ByMatt Gardner ByMatt Gardner, Senior Contributor. 'Beatable' has all the hallmarks of the next big rhythm-action game for VR. Everyone’s drummed with their hands, so it’s frankly mind-boggling that it’s taken until 2025 for a company to adapt this simple human urge into a mixed-reality experience. XR Games has created Beatable to finally gamify the pastime, and it looks like an incredibly affordable must-buy experience on Meta Quest. Beatable, which enters early access on the Meta Horizon Store today, only costs $9.99 and lets you play music using your hands on a table. There’s no danger of smashing your Meta Quest controllers, running through over half a dozen plastic Rock Band drum sets (guilty!), or missing an input on an elaborately designed virtual rig — this is as tactile as they come. Really, it might be the most intuitive physical game ever made for VR headsets. All you need is an appropriately raised flat surface (e.g. tea tray, footstool, very docile and level-spined dog) for tapping, clapping, and finger snapping. It hopes to make the genre more of a real-world, tactile experience, and really, it needs to be seen to be believed — a record-setting performance by XR creative director Chuan Liu, filmed without the bells and whistles of post-production, shows how the mechanics work, and just how scalable the game could be for veteran rhythm-action players. Beatable is pushing itself as the prime way to turn your real-life space into a studio — and part of the game. While you’re fully in control with your hands to make beats and gestures to hit notes, XR Games has also built in calibration tools to keep it as accurate as possible. If you want to remove yourself from your surroundings, that’s fine too, as you can ditch the mixed-reality settings. FEATURED | Frase ByForbes™ Unscramble The Anagram To Reveal The Phrase Pinpoint By Linkedin Guess The Category Queens By Linkedin Crown Each Region Crossclimb By Linkedin Unlock A Trivia Ladder XR’s Beatable soundtrack has launched with songs from artists local to the developer — including multi-platinum British DJ Tom Zanetti, bhangra group RDB, and Gamini Khurara — plus tunes from its previous, delightfully fun release Zombieland: Headshot Fever. It aims to curate an audio experience that doesn’t rely on a load of stock rhythm-game songs at you, much like vanilla Beat Saber. It sounds like XR is excited for more musical expansions, and if Beatable proves to be a hit, the best thing it could do is offer deep support for musicians and creators to add their own tracks, and even adapt others in the public domain, much like the superb Trombone Champ. All strictly legal, of course — but opening the floodgates for more content is always critical to long-term success. If you want to become an early adopter (I’m picking it up for the weekend), XR Games offers a Discord for those who want to give feedback or swap scores. It’s early access right now, but the simplicity of the idea could send Beatable to the moon. Let’s hope this one takes off.

Title: Nvidia Stock Could Fall If 125% China Tariff Drives Price Increases

Gadgets, robots and vehicles imbued with artificial intelligence will once again vie for attention at the Consumer Electronics Show, as vendors behind the scenes will seek ways to deal with tariffs threatened by US President-elect Donald Trump. The annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) opens formally in Las Vegas on January 7, 2025, but preceding days are packed with product announcements. (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images) Updated, April 10, 2025: This post has been adjusted to reflect the change in U.S. tariffs on China to 145%. Nvidia stock has fallen 30% from its January 2025 peak of $153, evaporating $1.03 trillion from the company’s market capitalization, according to Google Finance. One thing contributing to the drop is the results of the 2024 presidential election which brought Donald Trump back to the Oval Office. Since April 2, his tariff policy has thrown markets into turmoil. And despite Trump’s trumpeting of a 90-day pause on most tariffs, Nvidia could be in worse shape. That’s because tariffs are high on countries where Nvidia products are built. More specifically, Taiwan faced a 34% tariff – reduced Wednesday to 10% – while China’s rose to 145% on April 10, according to the Wall Street Journal. Is the drop in Nvidia’s stock a buying opportunity? I see no reason to buy now because although orders may have soared in the current quarter in anticipation of tariffs, I expect the company’s May 2025 earnings report to feature a disappointing growth forecast as a result of tariff uncertainty. More specifically, the uncertainty is due to the difficulty of answering precisely the following questions: Nvidia remains bullish. In March, CEO Jensen Huang said tariffs would not cause meaningful short-term harm to the company due to the company’s agile supply chain; demand for AI would drive demand, and TSMC was building a plant in Arizona, according to Barron’s. Nvidia declined to comment. A spokesperson referred me to a March 2025 company statement from Huang, which said. “Tariffs will have a little impact for us short term. Long term, we’re going to have manufacturing onshore.” Read on for why Nvidia’s costs could rise significantly, whether Nvidia will pass along those costs to customers, and how the uncertainty around future moves in the global tariff wars may crimp consumer spending and company’s investments in generative artificial intelligence. Nvidia will report quarterly financial results next month featuring slower top-line growth and thinner margins based on the company’s forecasts when it last reported in February. Nvidia expressed enthusiasm about its prospects. “We’ve successfully ramped up the massive-scale production of Blackwell AI supercomputers, achieving billions of dollars in sales in its first quarter," said Huang in a statement. "AI is advancing at light speed as agentic AI and physical AI set the stage for the next wave of AI to revolutionize the largest industries.” Analysts were underwhelmed by Nvidia’s results – which lacked “the positive shock value of some of last year’s reports,” Sungarden YARP Portfolio Investing Group Leader Rob Isbitts told SeekingAlpha. Nvidia’s stock is likely to trade “more on raw demand and supply, rather than on some sort of surprise element,” Isbitts added. “Guidance was slightly underwhelming,” Edward Jones analyst Logan Purk said in a report featured by Bloomberg. "We think it will be challenging for management to continue to significantly beat expectations for future growth,” Purk added. Tariffs could increase significantly the prices of some Nvidia products. However, it is unclear whether Nvidia will pass all of its increased costs on to customers and whether the higher prices would lower demand. A more significant question for Nvidia’s future is whether companies will view the high investment in generative AI as being worth the $1 trillion Goldman Sachs estimated. If the technology enables companies to do better work with fewer people, demand for generative AI may remain strong in the event of a recession. Not all of Nvidia’s products are vulnerable to being harmed by Trump’s tariffs. For example, fears of a Trump administration crackdown on Nvidia’s H20 chip – which the company has been exporting to China – may not be realized. The reason? “Nvidia promised the Trump administration new U.S. investments in AI data centers,” according to a report from NPR. However, tariffs could raise consumer personal computer prices by as much as 50%, according to WCCFTech. These estimates were made April 3 when the tariff on Chinese goods was a mere 54% – a far cry from the 145% tariff imposed on April 10. Tariffs could raise manufacturer’s suggested retail price prices on the following Nvidia gaming machines by at least 50% – based on the latest triple-digit tariff: It remains unclear whether Nvidia will be able to avoid tariffs on GPUs for now. The tariffs could be avoided if actual products are assembled in the U.S., noted Tom’s Hardware. For now, Nvidia may be able to ship “actual GPUs and processors/chipsets to the U.S. without paying import duties along with half-finished logic boards – but paying an import tariff -- then assemble actual products in the U.S.,” reported Tom’s Hardware. Generative AI has been in search of a killer app, as I wrote in the Boston Globe. There has been no obvious progress on this goal and the investment required for the technology is enormous – potentially totaling $1 trillion. Prior to the tariff announcement, the largest hyperscalers – Amazon, Google, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft – announced plans to spend $270 billion on generative AI data centers in 2025, according to the Wall Street Journal. However, that spending could take a hit – especially for companies like Meta and Google which are dependent on advertising for much of their revenue. If tariffs and the resulting uncertainty cause a recession – due to rising prices and fear of declining demand and higher unemployment – companies could decide to cut back on their generative AI spending. The reason for cutting back would be a simple realization that the return on investment in generative AI is not yet compelling. Amazon’s cloud-computing arm historically has generated $4 of incremental revenue for every $1 of capital spending, TD Cowen John Blackledge tech analyst told the Journal. Generative AI’s ratio “is currently something like 20 cents for every dollar,” Blackledge added. Microsoft, which plans to spend $80 billion on infrastructure in the current fiscal year, is slowing construction – including a $1 billion project in Ohio. Microsoft canceled leases in the U.S. and Europe -- partly due to an oversupply of data-center space relative to the company’s demand forecast, noted TD Cowen analysts. However, “the moves signal a more cautious stance in the longer term,” the Journal reported. All that could be painful for Nvidia investors – unless surviving with fewer people during a long period of stagflation becomes the killer app for generative AI.

The roller-coaster week for global stock markets took another sharp turn Thursday, yanking Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and other Big Tech stocks down with it. The latest shift erased some of Wednesday’s historic gains, which came as President Donald Trump abruptly announced a 90-day pause on tariff hikes for most countries. After the president’s announcement, Apple stock recorded its best performance in roughly 27 years. However, the pause left out China — which is home to much of Big Tech’s meticulously designed supply chain, including Apple’s. By Thursday, markets seemed reluctant to trust a temporary policy pivot that arrived without warning — even as fresh inflation data offered some welcome relief. Thus, another bad day unfolded for investors. Apple closed the day down 4.2%, while Amazon dropped about 5.2%, Nvidia fell about 5.9%, Meta (META) plunged 6.7%, Microsoft (MSFT) fell 2.3%, and Tesla (TSLA) gave up 7.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended Thursday down 4.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.5% and the S&P 500 fell about 3.5%. For Tesla, the plunge came as analysts slashed their price targets for the EV stock — over Trump’s impending tariffs on auto parts and weakening demand for Tesla EVs in Europe and China. Meanwhile, Amazon cautioned that tariffs will drive up prices, Apple fell as the Trump administration clarified the latest tariffs on China (145%), and Meta declined as the company attempted to downplay a tell-all book by former Facebook public-policy executive Sarah Wynn-Williams. Other tech losers included Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which tanked about 8.4%, Intel (INTC), which took a roughly 7.7% dive, and Palantir (PLTR), which fell 3.7%. Hardly any tech-adjacent stock dodged the carnage, but some of the rare exceptions included U.S.-focused telecom stocks, as well as video game maker Electronic Arts (EA). —Catherine Baab contributed to this article.

(Photo Illustration by Avishek Das/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Question: Why choose to invest in Meta stock (NASDAQ: META) at 25 times earnings when Google stock (NASDAQ: GOOG) is available at a lower multiple of 20? You might still want to, especially when you consider these key points: Some might consider Meta a “safe haven,” but its past market behavior suggests otherwise. For example, META stock dropped more than 75% during the 2022 inflation shock, and fell by around 35% during the uncertainty of 2020. So, it’s not exactly a safe stock. Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash shows how key stocks have performed during and after the last six market crashes. META’s stock price experienced a significant pullback, declining from nearly $740 in February to approximately $505 earlier this week. Subsequently, following President Trump’s announcement of a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, the stock rallied to its current price of $585. For investors looking for a potentially more resilient and better-performing option, consider the Trefis High Quality portfolio. This strategy has delivered more than 75% returns since inception, as shown by its HQ performance metrics. If you’re confident in the long-term potential of AI, Meta Platforms offers a compelling opportunity. Unlike companies that only build AI, Meta also implements it across billions of users. This gives Meta a unique edge in monetizing AI advances through advertising, content suggestions, and improved user experiences. With substantial investments in AI R&D and the largest social media user base globally, Meta is well-positioned to benefit from AI growth—no matter which specific technologies win out. Despite its advantages, investing in Meta involves risk. One concern is that Meta’s earnings could fall short, or its growth could decline from 20% to around 15% soon. This slowdown may stem from the broader economy, where businesses are likely to cut ad spending to conserve cash. Additionally, unknown or unexpected shocks could negatively impact the stock. As a result, investors should be ready for possible steep declines—up to 40%. Selling during such downturns could hurt long-term returns. Still, for those with a 3-5 year time horizon who can handle volatility, Meta’s current price levels might present a good entry point into AI. If you're interested in strategies to weather downturns and even benefit from them, you might look into the Trefis Reinforced Value Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices), or speak with a financial advisor experienced in bear markets. Staying calm and strategic during market swings is often key to building substantial wealth. Invest with Trefis Market Beating Portfolios | Rules-Based Wealth

Title: These tech leaders donated to Trump. Now they’re out billions of dollars | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Silicon Valley leaders donated to President Donald Trump’s campaign or inaugural fund. They visited him at Mar-a-Lago and sat front-and-center as he was sworn into office. But in the first three months of his presidency, their wallets have taken a hit from his policies. The companies founded or run by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos have cumulatively lost nearly $1.8 trillion in value since the start of this year, even after markets rebounded Wednesday in response to Trump’s pause on many planned tariffs. As a result, the personal wealth of those leaders has shrunk, too. Tech’s top brass almost certainly hoped to gain some business benefits by hitching their wagons to Trump’s — such as fewer regulations or reduced antitrust pressure. And Trump has been eager to expand the tech industry’s US footprint and cement America as a leader in artificial intelligence. But the losses across Big Tech indicate that Silicon Valley will also face a slew of new challenges in the wake of uncertainty around Trump’s tariff plans, which heavily target supply chains in Asia where tech companies source components and assemble products. Despite Trump’s pause on “reciprocal” tariffs that had been set to apply to many US trading partners, tariffs on China will increase to 125% from 104%. And while tariffs pose a direct challenge to tech giants, their economic ripple effects could also have negative implications if consumers and advertisers tighten their purse strings. Analysts had warned that long-term reciprocal tariffs, and the resulting economic uncertainty, could shrink tech earnings by as much as 25%, according to a Sunday report from UBS. That would mark a big shift from the relatively steady profit and share price gains that Big Tech has enjoyed in recent years thanks to AI. On Monday, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives described Trump’s tariff policy as an “Armageddon” for the tech sector, adding that it “makes the tech investing landscape the most difficult I have seen in 25 years covering tech stocks.” Meta, Apple, Amazon, Tesla and a representative for Musk did not respond to requests for comment. Google declined to comment. Musk has experienced the most dramatic losses. Despite donating at least $290 million to support Trump’s reelection and his involvement in the Department of Government Efficiency, the world’s richest man’s net worth has plunged $143 billion since the start of 2025, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index data from April 8. That’s due largely to the sharp decline in Tesla shares, weighed down by Musk’s controversial work in the government, increasing competition and now, the threat of tariffs. Tesla shares fell 28% and its market capitalization dropped $376.6 billion since the start of this year, as of market close on April 9, having largely erased its post-election gains. Musk has said tariffs could have a “significant” impact on Tesla. While Musk may be in the spotlight due to his proximity to Trump, he’s not the only prominent tech figure to experience recent losses. (The most recent net worth data available on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index is from April 8; the scale of their losses may be smaller after the market’s rebound Wednesday.) Meta was one of the first big companies to pledge a $1 million donation to Trump’s inaugural fund, and Zuckerberg has met with Trump repeatedly, both before and after he took office, to discuss policy priorities. Zuckerberg also made several Trump-friendly changes to his business, including elevating a prominent Republican to the company’s top policy job, cutting professional fact-checkers and adding Trump ally and UFC boss Dana White to Meta’s board of directors. Zuckerberg’s net worth has fallen by $26.5 billion since the start of 2025. Meta’s share price has declined nearly 2.25% year-to-date, dragging down the company’s valuation by $35.8 billion. Bezos was quick to congratulate Trump on his election win in November, calling it an “extraordinary political comeback,” and Amazon donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund. Bezos was also behind The Washington Post’s controversial decision not to endorse a presidential candidate in the 2024 election. Bezos’ net worth has declined by $47.2 billion since the start of this year, according to Bloomberg. Amazon’s shares are down 13% year-to-date, bringing the company’s total valuation down by $316.8 billion since the start of this year. Google donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund and streamed the event live on YouTube. And Pichai joined the parade of CEOs who visited Mar-a-Lago in the weeks following the election. But Google’s stock has now fallen 16.2%, and its valuation is down $386.7 billion since the start of this year. Apple’s Cook also personally donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee, Axios reported in January, after meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago following the election to discuss tariffs and European tech regulations. Apple also handed Trump a political win earlier this year when it announced a $500 billion investment in US facilities over the next four years. Although some of those plans were likely in place before Trump took office, the president claimed credit for the move, saying it showed “faith in what we are doing.” But Apple, which produces many of its gadgets in foreign markets such as China, Vietnam and India, is expected to take an especially big hit from Trump’s tariffs. Its stock is down 18.5% from the start of this year, and $684 billion has been shaved off its market value. During Trump’s first term, many big tech companies lobbied for exemptions from Trump’s tariffs. This time, however, the situation is much less certain, a point that analysts at Moody’s Ratings made in a recent research note. “While it is difficult to estimate the effects,” the analysts wrote, “we believe no technology subsector will go unharmed.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Market Value Craters $20 Billion On March 27 After Muddy Waters Takes Aim, Class Action Pending – Hagens Berman

April 09, 2025 18:58 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On March 27, 2025, investors in AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) saw the price of their shares drop $65.92, wiping out about $20 billion of the company’s market value, after prominent short seller Muddy Waters Research revealed its short position in the stock. Muddy Waters’ report comes on the heels of a recently filed securities class action lawsuit, captioned Quiero v. AppLovin Corporation, et al., No. 4:25-cv-02294 (N.D. Cal.). The suit seeks to represent investors who purchased AppLovin securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Hagens Berman is investigating the claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com | 844-916-0895 Recent Development: On March 27, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a scathing report titled “AppLovin: Deep Data Analysis Shows APP is Just Another Scammy AdTech Company.” The report’s focus is in part on “retargeting” (a strategy that aims to re-engage potential customers who have previously interacted with a brand), “incrementality” (the additional or incremental lift in sales or conversions that a marketing activity generates), and AppLovin’s compliance with third party platforms’ TOS (terms of service). Muddy Waters contends that “APP e-commerce is Mostly Retargeting, Incrementality is Low, and it Clearly Violates Platforms’ TOS.” Muddy Waters alleges that: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Securities Class Action: The Muddy Waters report follows the filing of a securities class action complaint alleging AppLovin made false and misleading statements, while failing to disclose critical details about its flagship AXON 2.0 digital advertising platform. The company had heavily promoted the platform as "the best and fastest-growing product we’ve ever released." Investors were allegedly led to believe that the platform, which reportedly leverages “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would redefine the digital advertising landscape by enhancing ad placement efficiency and expanding into e-commerce and web-based marketing. However, the alleged narrative first shifted on February 26, 2025, when short sellers Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research published damaging reports that raised pointed questions about the company’s claims. Both research firms accused AppLovin of misleading investors regarding the platform's true capabilities and ethical practices. Fuzzy Panda Research alleged that the company violated app store policies by exploiting user data in questionable ways, predicting that tech giants Apple and Google would ban AppLovin from their app stores. Additionally, they accused AppLovin of “stealing data from Meta” as part of its e-commerce initiatives, foreseeing swift retaliation from Meta. Culper Research criticized the company for allegedly using AXON 2.0 as little more than a promotional facade to obscure the real drivers behind its business strategy. Culper's report further claimed that AppLovin's growth in mobile gaming has relied on “systematic exploitation of app permissions that enable advertisements themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations onto users’ phones, with just a single click – an event that is often inadvertent thanks to the Company’s notorious UX gimmicks” and that “each illicit install translates directly to profit.” “We are investigating claims that AppLovin may have misled investors about whether its growth may be attributable to illegitimate conduct,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe. If you invested in AppLovin and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm’s investigation, submit your losses now.

WB Discovery’s stock surges 20% after the president’s announcement A number of media and tech stocks suddenly leaped higher on Wednesday afternoon, after President Trump stunned Wall Street by announcing a 90-day pause on tariffs for countries that are currently negotiating with the U.S. on new trade deals. Comcast and Netflix enjoyed big jumps on Wednesday, with each company seeing its share price increase more than 7%, while WB Discovery’s stock price surged 20.62% by the time markets closed. Apple, meanwhile, increased 15.33% to about $199 per share — a welcome sight for investors in the world’s most valuable company, after it shed nearly $1 trillion from its market cap over the last four trading days. “I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately,” the president posted on Truth Social. “Thank you for your attention to this matter!” The announcement sent the three major indexes soaring higher, with the S&P 500 up 9.52%, the Dow Jones up 7.87%, and the Nasdaq up 12.62% by the time trading ended on Wednesday. It was the largest single-day percentage jump for the tech-heavy Nasdaq since 2001 and its second-largest ever, while the S&P 500 had its biggest day since 2008, per CNBC. Other tech and media stocks that are up big include: Fox Corp.: +8.56% News Corp.: +9.22% Roku: +15.90% Amazon: +11.98% Meta: +14.76% Simultaneously, President Trump said he was increasing the tariff against China to 125% — hours after a new 104% tariff against Chinese goods went into effect at 12:01 a.m. ET on Wednesday. The jump for the three major indexes comes after brutal stretch for Wall Street bulls, following the president’s unveiling of his “liberation day” tariff plan last week. Overall, the downturn was the sharpest Wall Street had experienced since COVID-19 rocked the markets in March 2020. Earlier on Wednesday, JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon had warned a recession was “likely” if the new tariff plan remained in place, echoing the fears many other business bigwigs and Wall Street analysts have shared in the past week. That sentiment appeared to suddenly shift on Wednesday afternoon, with prominent hedge fund manager Bill Ackman lauding the president on X. “This was brilliantly executed by @RealDonaldTrump,” Ackman posted. “Textbook, Art of the Deal.” President Trump, as markets opened earlier in the day, urged Americans to “BE COOL!” on Truth Social, saying “everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!” He then added moments later “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY,” followed by three exclamation points. On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said countries were “falling over themselves” to make deals with the U.S. Trump, in his Truth Social post on Wednesday, said more than 75 countries had reached out about making trade deals.

Title: Tech CEOs Bent Over Backwards for Trump and Their "Reward" Has Been Horrible

Tech CEOs spent millions of dollars on donations to president Donald Trump's campaign and inauguration, and by bending the knee after he was elected. But instead of facing a reinvigorated and less regulated tech market in return, they've instead gotten a kick in the teeth. As the New York Times reports, Trump's disastrous tariff war has caused the global stock market to crater, sending economic uncertainty soaring. And the global supply chains that big tech companies have been relying on for decades have been thrown into chaos. Even investment in the hottest thing in tech right now — artificial intelligence — could take a massive hit, as the cost of building out already-expensive data centers is expected to rise dramatically. It's a bizarre situation. Trump himself has appeared keen to keep the AI gravy train going, overseeing the signing of a $500 billion AI infrastructure deal dubbed Stargate. Yet his trade war could make AI companies' commitments difficult to hold up in the longterm as foreign-made chips could soon spike in price. In short, Trump's trade war could lead to a major falling out with big tech. Apple, in particular, has felt the hurt, reportedly flying planes full of iPhones into the US ahead of Trump's latest round of tariffs coming into effect. That's despite Apple CEO Tim Cook cozying up to Trump, donating $1 million to his inauguration and promising to spend half a trillion dollars in the US back in February. But despite paying lip service to the idea of moving manufacturing to the US, Apple hasn't fulfilled that promise for any of its major products. Instead, it tried to lower its reliance on China by moving assembly lines to India and Vietnam instead — countries that have since been hit with 26 and 46 percent tariffs, respectively. Tech CEOs who were hoping to encounter fewer regulatory hurdles with the Trump administration could soon face even more headwinds. The White House has signaled that it's looking to continue Biden-era antitrust cases looking to break up big tech companies, per the NYT. "Big Tech has run wild for years, stifling competition in our most innovative sector and, as we all know, using its market power to crack down on the rights of so many Americans, as well as those of Little Tech!" Trump wrote in a January post on Truth Social. In short, tech leaders' efforts to get in the president's good graces are far from paying off. Just last week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg visited the White House to beg him to settle an antitrust lawsuit against the company. Legislators are worried Trump could simply drop the case, an investigation that has been going on for almost six years. Even after prostrating himself to Trump, though, it's easy to imagine that the president will simply allow the case to proceed.

The move appears aimed at isolating the trade conflict with China rather than continuing a global standoff. Trump cited outreach from over 75 countries for trade talks as the reason for his partial pullback, announcing a reduced 10% baseline tariff during the pause—still higher than previous levels. Markets cheered the shift, with the S&P 500 jumping over 9%. However, Trump’s plan for non-China trade partners remains vague. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said countries like Japan, South Korea, and India are seeking negotiations. While the administration framed the move as a strategic pause, critics see it as a response to deepening recession fears, bond market turmoil, and plummeting business confidence. The broader economic impact of Trump’s evolving tariff strategy remains uncertain. China is reaching out to other nations as the US layers on more tariffs in what appears to be an attempt to form a united front to compel Washington to retreat. Days into the effort, it’s meeting only partial success with many countries unwilling to ally with the main target of President Donald Trump’s trade war. Facing the cratering of global markets, Trump on Wednesday backed off his tariffs on most nations for 90 days, saying countries were lining up to negotiate more favourable conditions. China has refused to seek talks, saying it would “fight to the end” in a tariff war, prompting Trump to further jack up the tax rate on Chinese imports to 125 per cent. China has retaliated with tariffs on US goods of 84 per cent, which took effect Thursday. - AP-PTI Trump’s move was seemingly an attempt to narrow what had been an unprecedented trade war between the US and most of the world to a showdown between the US and China. EU delays countermeasures against Trump's tariffs for 90 days to allow for negotiations, says Ursula von der Leyen. US pauses reciprocal tariffs, India's aluminium industry closely monitors trade flows amid global market meltdown and tariff changes. World markets soared on Thursday, with Japan’s benchmark jumping over 9 per cent, as investors welcomed US President Donald Trump’s decision to put his sharp tariff hikes on hold for 90 days, though he excluded China from the reprieve. However, US futures edged lower and oil prices also declined. Chinese shares saw more moderate gains, given yet another jump in the tariffs each side is imposing on each others’ exports. In early trading, Germany’s DAX gained more than 8 per cent and benchmarks in London and Paris gained more than 6 per cent .

The 90-day respite from reciprocal tariffs extended by US President Donald Trump to most countries on Wednesday has given more time to India to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement (BTA) with the US but the pressure is certainly not off the Indian negotiating team as their American counterparts are expected to bargain hard.India-US trade pact: Reciprocal tariff pause not to take pressure off Indian negotiatorsUS extends tariff respite, India under pressure to negotiate BTA with US amid demands for tariff cuts and non-tariff issues. US extends tariff respite, India under pressure to negotiate BTA with US amid demands for tariff cuts and non-tariff issues. U.S. container imports rose 11% year over year in March, continuing this year’s outsized monthly gains, but U.S. President Donald Trump’s escalating tariffs are dimming the outlook for later this year, trade executives said. U.S. seaport imports totaled 2,380,674 20-foot-equivalent units (TEUs) in March, the third-highest level recorded for the month, supply chain technology provider Descartes said on Thursday. China accounted for nearly one-third of overall import volume in March. That volume rose 9.4% year-on-year, as front-loading by tariff-avoiding importers continued to fuel this year’s near-record monthly import gains. Still, trade with China - the top U.S. maritime trading partner - is softening. Volume fell 12.6% from February to March, after the Trump administration imposed 10% tariffs on China-made goods in February and an additional 10% tariff in March. ( Reuters) The tariff war raises concern about world economic growth but it is too early to tell what this means for Sweden and monetary policy, Swedish central bank’s Deputy Governor Anna Seim told Reuters on Thursday. “It is too early to say how we will act (at the monetary policy meeting in May) and we will have to analyse incoming data and see what we think it could mean for our forecasts and future prospects,” Seim told Reuters after a speech in Stockholm. India wants to move quickly on a trade deal with the United States, a government official said on Thursday, after President Donald Trump’s stunning decision to pause hefty reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries, while hiking levies on China. India and the United States had agreed in February to work on the first phase of a trade deal to be wrapped up by autumn 2025, aiming to reach two-way trade worth $500 billion by 2030. Read more Trade Ministry did not immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment. Taiwan’s exports rose more than expected in March to a record level as customers placed orders ahead of expectations of U.S. tariffs, with uncertainty over global trade policy clouding the outlook. Exports jumped 18.6% from the same month a year ago to $45.97 billion, the finance ministry said on Thursday, topping a forecast of 8.45% in a Reuters poll, though off February’s 31.5% gain, making March the 16th consecutive month of gains. (Reuters) Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and European Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security Maros Sefcovic held discussions via video on Tuesday and discussed enhancing China-EU economic and trade cooperation and responding to the “reciprocal tariffs” imposed by the US, the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) said on Thursday in a statement, Xinhua reported. The EU and China are each other’s largest trading partners.During their talks, Wang noted that the US “reciprocal tariffs” seriously violate the legitimate interests of other countries, breach the WTO rules, undermine the rules-based multilateral trading system, and disrupt the stability of the global economic order. Wang said that the US move is typical “unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying”. He further said that China is willing to resolve disputes through consultation and negotiation, but it will fight to the end if the United States continues to act wilfully. China and EU have agreed to start consultation on issues concerning market access at an early date, and immediately start negotiations on electric vehicle pricing commitments as well as issues related to bilateral investment cooperation in the auto sector as per the official Xinhua Agency. With US President Donald Trump going all out in his trade war on China by imposing 125 per cent tariff on import of Chinese goods, Beijing has reached out to the European Union (EU) and ASEAN countries to forge an united front and force the US to backtrack.Beijing has retaliated with “countermeasures” imposing an 84 per cent tariff on US goods, which will take effect on Thursday. The 27-nation European Union bloc also hit back at Trump’s tariffs on Wednesday by approving levies of up to 25 per cent. China and the European Union vowed to jointly uphold the multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core, China’s commerce ministry said in a statement released today as per Chinese state media. European shares surged on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced an immediate 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for most trading partners, prompting a massive relief rally after days-long market rout. (Reuters) President Donald Trump’s US tariff whiplash and the Chinese yuan’s trajectory will likely keep Asian currency volatility elevated. Currency volatility across the region has jumped ever since the larger-than-expected new US tariffs were announced last week, while foreign currency options signal increased bearishness. Concerns over economic growth have also driven more aggressive bets that regional central banks will cut interest rates. Uncertainty could remain high, even as Trump paused higher tariffs on most economies except China on Wednesday. With Beijing’s warning of a “resolute” response, investors will be looking out for signs that the yuan will undergo a devaluation, a move that would make Chinese exports cheaper but risk capital flight. The yuan reference rate, which guides traders, crossed the key 7.20 per dollar level on Tuesday. ( Bloomberg) China is not interested in a fight but will not fear if the United States continues its tariff threats, the Chinese foreign ministry said in reply to questions about the U.S. tariffs on Thursday. “The U.S. cause doesn’t win the support of the people and will end in failure,” ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular press conference. China will not sit back and let the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese people be deprived, Lin said. Taiwan is planning a surge in US purchases over the next decade that would triple the share of American liquefied natural gas in the island’s mix. State-operated entities could buy goods worth $200 billion from the US over the next 10 years, Minister of Economic Affairs Kuo Jyh-Huei said Thursday, according to a report from Taipei-based Economic Daily News. The purchases would include boosting the share of US LNG in Taiwan’s total imports to 30% from current levels around 10%, he said. Asian governments from South Korea to Indonesia are rushing to sign up for LNG purchases from the US, hoping to reduce trade surpluses with the world’s largest economy and secure some relief from President Donald Trump’s sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs. Kuo said he hoped Taiwan would be included in the first wave of negotiations, according to EDN. Taiwan’s trade surplus with the US surged more than 80% to a record $64.9 billion last year. The island got about 10% of its LNG from the US last year, with most shipments arriving from Australia and Qatar under long-term supply contracts. “Meta started briefing the Chinese Communist Party as early as 2015,” said Wynn-Williams, who recently published a memoir titled Careless People about her experience at Facebook.Meta whistleblower says company aided China in AI race “Meta started briefing the Chinese Communist Party as early as 2015,” said Wynn-Williams. “Meta started briefing the Chinese Communist Party as early as 2015,” said Wynn-Williams. Iron ore futures rebounded on Thursday, as an escalating Sino-U.S. trade war lifted hopes of more aggressive stimulus measures from Beijing to counter the impact of the hefty tariffs. The most-traded September iron ore contract on China’s Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE) closed daytime trade 3.06% higher at 707 yuan ($96.30) a metric ton, after falling to its lowest in more than six months on Wednesday. The benchmark May iron ore on the Singapore Exchange added 1.76% to $96.45 a ton as of 0700 GMT. It hit an intraday high of $99.5 in the session. “The prospect of a prolonged trade war has also raised expectations for Beijing to unveil more aggressive stimulus measures,” ING analysts said. “Even if the tariffs are reversed entirely, it’s unlikely the other nations will dismiss this incident and conclude that they have nothing to worry about in terms of relations with the U.S,” the 78-year-old wrote in the memo titled Nobody Knows (Yet Again). The introduction of the tariffs program will have “entirely unpredictable” impacts on economies, he said. “Last week’s events remind us of the events of 2008 and the Global Financial Crisis they produced. All norms have been overthrown,” he said. “The way world trade has operated for the last 80 years may be of little relevance to the future.” Donald Trump’s tariff policies have the potential to be the biggest economic event of our lifetimes, according to Oaktree Capital Management Co-Founder Howard Marks, who warned that reversing them could still have consequences. “I consider the tariff developments thus far to be what soccer fans call an own goal,” he wrote in a note on Wednesday. “They’re highly analogous to Brexit, and we know how that turned out. Brexit cost the British mightily in terms of GDP, morale, and alliances, and it harmed their reputation for governance and stability. All of this damage was self-inflicted.” China’s commerce ministry said on Thursday that China is open to dialogue with the U.S. but this must be on the basis of mutual respect and equality. Pressure, threats and blackmail are not the right way to deal with China, ministry spokesperson He Yongqian told a regular press briefing when asked about whether the world’s two largest economies have started tariff negotiations. China will “follow through to the end” if the U.S. insists on its own way, he said. Saudi Arabia’s stock market led most of its Gulf peers higher early on Thursday, tracking global shares, after U.S. President Donald Trump’s unexpected decision to temporarily suspend most of his recently imposed tariffs. Saudi Arabia’s benchmark index jumped 4%, buoyed by a 3.8% rise in Al Rajhi Bank and a 3.9% increase in the country’s biggest lender Saudi National Bank. Saudi Arabia has been hit by the minimum 10% tariff rate, which at present will remain in place. Dubai’s main share index was up 2%, while the Abu Dhabi index climbed 1.3%. Elsewhere, the Qatari benchmark advanced 2.5%. China will likely fill the gap with supply from Middle Eastern producers like Oman or the United Arab Emirates, although it could also ramp up its buying of sensitive crude, including from Iran and Russia.US crude flows to China trickle to near zero after tariff blitzUS-China trade war leads to near-zero oil flow, impacting global trade relations and shifting oil markets in Asia. US-China trade war leads to near-zero oil flow, impacting global trade relations and shifting oil markets in Asia. The world’s wealthiest people added $304 billion to their combined net worth on Wednesday — the largest one-day gain in the history of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index — as stock markets soared after President Donald Trump pledged to pause tariffs on some trading partners. “While this pause does not extend to China, the overall positive sentiment has had a spillover effect, boosting investor confidence in Asian markets, including Hong Kong. “Investor optimism around a potential US-China deal has also resurfaced after President Trump suggested tariffs on China may have peaked ... Meanwhile, expectations remain high for continued domestic stimulus from Chinese authorities to support growth. “However, several uncertainties remain and the trade-weighted effective tariff rate is still jumping higher. There is also likely to be plenty of volatility in the coming weeks as negotiation headlines take centre stage.” “Even though it’s obvious that the tariffs are targeting China, there is still some room for manoeuvring and negotiations if they can pause tariffs on other countries. Markets still have some hope that at least some discussions could take place. China is also likely to roll out stimulus measures to support the economy and counter the impact of the tariffs in the near future. “Will the tariffs be rolled back to the level before? The chances of that happening are quite slim. Therefore, even if the market sees some short-term gains, I don’t think it will quickly return to previous levels or experience a significant rebound.” “With China imposing 84% tariffs on goods from the US, the cost of US crude would be almost double — $51 a barrel more expensive, based on $61 WTI,” said Ivan Mathews, head of APAC analysis for Vortexa. “This makes running US crude uneconomical for Chinese refiners.” US crude imports to China will “likely dwindle to zero in the coming months if the current tariff levels stay,” he added. The flow of oil from the world’s biggest producer to its largest importer is set to thin to virtually zero as a trade war between the two powerhouse economies escalates. After climbing in recent years, oil shipments from the US to China have been on the decline for much of 2025, thanks to US President Donald Trump’s successive rounds of tariffs at a time when the domestic refining sector is already under pressure. Beijing’s retaliation, raising tariffs on US imports to 84%, plus the latest US hike in duties on China to 125%, have only darkened the picture further. US flows are by no means vital to China — crude flows from the US to China in the early months of this year added up to roughly 1% of the Asian nation’s total imports, according to data from analytics firm Vortexa Ltd. — but the collapse of oil purchases is indicative of a wider breakdown of trade relations between the world’s two largest economies. Sri Lankan shares jumped over 5% on Thursday, set for their best day since July 2023, mirroring gains in the wider Asia market after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on the hefty tariffs imposed on most nations. The CSE All Share index was last trading 5.3% higher at 15,659.56, with gains led by financial stocks. Asian peers were up 4.8%. The pause in U.S. reciprocal tariffs, however, did not apply to China. The Trump administration had imposed a 44% tariff on the island nation that has been steadily recovering from its worst financial crisis in decades. The temporary reprieve eases concerns in Sri Lanka, which had estimated that the tariffs would affect some $3 billion of exports. The day’s gains helped trim losses since Trump announced the tariffs on April 2 to about 2.7%. The CSE All Share index is down 2.3% so far this year. Amid the ongoing tariff war between China and the US, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said China “is not afraid of provocations, and it won’t back down.”Mao Ning shared a video of former Chinese leader Mao Zedong from 1953 during its war with the US. While sharing the video on X, Mao Ning stated, “We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down.”In the video posted on X, Zedong said, “As to how long this war will last, we are not the ones who can decide,” he says. “It used to depend on President Truman, and it will depend on President Eisenhower, or whoever becomes the next US president. It’s up to them.”“No matter how long this war is going to last, we will never yield. We’ll fight until we completely triumph,” he added. “Trump’s wanton policies will inevitably face internal and external pressure, so they’re not sustainable. Higher tariffs won’t address issues such as the trade deficit, the manufacturing sector’s hollowing out, and government debt problems. Instead, it will trigger U.S. economic recession, and dent U.S. sovereign creditability. “China stocks have limited room to fall, as valuations are relatively low, and China has in recent years reduced economic reliance on the U.S., contained property risks, upgraded manufacturing and made technological breakthroughs.” Tokyo is expected to be among nations taking priority in trade negotiations with Washington. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he would be speaking to officials from Japan, Vietnam, India and South Korea in the coming days. Japan still faces a 25% tariff on cars, auto parts, steel and aluminum, while other goods remain subject to the 10% flat tax rate applied to all nations. Japanese officials are concerned that the tariffs, especially on autos, pose a grave threat to the nation’s economy. Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said on Thursday he will do his utmost to offset the impact of the tariffs by introducing economic measures. He added that he would continue to pay close attention to the effect US trade policy is having on financial markets. Japan sees the pause on some of the tariffs as a positive development, but will continue to call for a review of the levies that remain in place, said Akazawa, who also serves as minister for economic revitalization. Japan will continue to urge the US to rethink its tariff plans in hopes of winning a longer-term reprieve from higher rates that President Donald Trump put on hold, the nation’s top trade representative said. “There is no change in Japan’s policy,” said Ryosei Akazawa, who was this week appointed the country’s top negotiator on the US levies. “We will pursue Japan’s national interests to the maximum extent without panicking or making a fuss.” (Bloomberg) While financial markets are welcoming President Donald Trump’s pause on higher tariffs for dozens of trade partners, American imports taxes are still at an historic high and a US recession is still a risk, economists say. Trump on Wednesday reduced tariffs on countries that were earlier hit with higher levies to a 10% baseline rate, with the exception of China which faces a 125% import duty. Yet the average US tariff rate is still rising to 24%, up almost 22 percentage points since Trump started his second term, according to Bloomberg Economics (Bloomberg) European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Thursday welcomed US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a pause in reciprocal tariffs. “Clear, predictable conditions are essential for trade and supply chains to function,” she said in a statement on X. She added that tariffs are taxes that only hurt businesses and consumers. “That’s why I’ve consistently advocated for a zero-for-zero tariff agreement between the European Union and the United States,” she said. (Reuters) “The volatility is not over, the environment remains uncertain and some of the impacts are irreversible. “The discussions with China now appear to be more protracted than initial expectations - we have not reduced China given that we are seeing a more fundamental improvement and there are many levers that China can use in mitigation. “We are generally neutral weight. We only like two areas in China - cheap high growth China internet names and high yield state-owned enterprise (SOE) attractively valued names.” “Right now, it’s mainly a technical rebound. Obviously, Trump backed down yesterday. At the same time, he also expressed openness to negotiate with China. On China’s side, it’s very clear that we have a lot of confidence this time. Whether it’s the announcement of retaliation or the deployment of policies, it’s actually all been well-prepared in advance. “After seven years of experience since 2018, the proportion of U.S. in China’s total exports has significantly decreased. So, we’re no longer as passive as we were back then. I think this rebound will continue for a while.” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the US decision to pause a round of global tariffs can serve as a way to open “a door to negotiation” and therefore could lead to an agreement. Sanchez, speaking at a business forum Thursday during a visit to Vietnam, said his country considers the decision to impose the tariffs as “unjustified, unjust and harmful for everybody.” He also reiterated comments he made in the Southeast Asian nation the previous day that no one wins in a trade war. US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on higher tariffs that hit dozens of trade partners, while raising duties on China to 125%. Sanchez next heads to China, making him the first European head of government to meet President Xi Jinping since Trump presented the new tariffs last week. ( Bloomberg) Japan’s trade and industry ministry will consider taking action on imports of Chinese steel if any unfair practices are identified under World Trade Organization rules, a ministry official said on Thursday. The official also said that Japan will continue to urge the U.S. government to exempt it from steel and aluminium tariffs. The suspension of US tariffs is “good news”, it shows the US administration’s will to deescalate this trade conflict, Polish Finance Minister Andrzej Domanski said on Thursday. China is home to around half of Amazon’s sellers, with over 100,000 Amazon businesses registered in the southern city of Shenzhen alone, generating annual revenues of $35.3 billion, according to e-commerce services provider SmartScout. China also hosts the manufacturing bases of other major e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu. Imports and exports involving cross-border e-commerce were worth 2.63 trillion yuan ($358 billion) last year, according to China’s State Council. No other country comes even close to U.S. consumption power, significantly limiting the production the rest of the world can absorb and raising the risk of intensifying price wars among Chinese exporters squeezing profitability. Trump had raised the tax rate on Chinese imports to 125 per cent. “This isn’t just a tax issue, it’s that the entire cost structure gets entirely overwhelmed,” said Wang Xin, the head of the Shenzhen Cross-Border E-Commerce Association, which represents more than 3,000 Amazon sellers. “It’ll be very hard for anyone to survive in the U.S. market,” she told Reuters, noting the tariffs could also lead to customs delays and higher logistics costs. “So for all of us in the cross-border e-commerce business today, this is truly an unprecedented blow.” ( Reuters) Chinese companies that sell products on Amazon are preparing to hike prices for the U.S. or quit that market due to President Donald Trump’s unprecedented tariff hikes, sellers and the head of China’s largest e-commerce association said. India wants to move quickly on a trade deal with the United States, a government official said, after President Donald Trump’s stunning decision to pause hefty reciprocal tariffs he had just imposed on dozens of countries, except for China. “The 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs is a relief for Indian exporters, especially shrimp exporters,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ( Reuters) Brent fell below $65 a barrel, after its best one-day gain since October, while west Texas Intermediate was near $62. With markets in turmoil, Trump announced a 90-day halt on higher tariffs against dozens of nations, but he also raised duties on China to 125 per cent. Beijing’s top leaders are poised to meet Thursday to discuss additional stimulus. Read the Bloomberg report Oil had hit a four-year low earlier this week as the aggressive US tariff push sparked warnings of a global recession. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman said on Thursday said China was now isolated and other U.S. trading partners were lining up to make deals following President Donald Trump’s stunning reversal of his tariff decision. Trump said on Wednesday said he would temporarily lower the hefty duties he had just imposed on dozens of countries while further ramping up pressure on China. “Time is not China’s friend as every U.S. corporation with a supply chain based in China is seeking to move it to countries that are likely to make favorable tariff deals with the United States,” Ackman said in a post on X.

China has vowed to boost domestic consumption as tariffs threaten exports, which contributed to nearly a third of the country’s economic expansion in 2024. The country is on track for the longest streak of economy-wide price declines since the 1960s as a result of weak spending, while the property crash has yet to bottom out. ( Bloomberg) As Donald Trump announced pause on tariffs for 90 days for trade negotiations, India should avoid signing a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States, as it may require India to make harmful trade-offs, suggested Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).

While an earlier-than-usual Chinese New Year holiday helped lift prices at the start of 2025, deflationary risks have since intensified as tensions between the US and China spiraled into a tit-for-tat cycle of tariff increases. Prices could come under pressure to weaken further should exporters redirect some goods to the domestic market or if other countries facing higher US tariffs divert their products to China. ( Bloomberg) “CPI inflation failed to rebound above the zero threshold in March as price pressures persist across the board,” ING’s Song said. “Combined with a sharp escalation of tariffs, this sets up a suitable window for the People’s Bank of China to resume monetary policy easing,” says Lynn Song, Greater China chief economist at ING Bank NV ING Bank NV downgraded its 2025 CPI forecast to zero from 0.7% China’s core CPI, which excludes volatile items such as food and energy, rebounded to 0.5% in March from minus 0.1% in the previous month. Factory deflation persisted for a 30th month, with the producer-price index recording a faster drop of 2.5% compared to 2.2% in February. The Philippines has reached out to the U.S. Trade Representative to explore potential trade negotiations, with the best outcome being a free-trade agreement, the Economic Affairs minister said on Thursday after Washington said it would pause planned tariffs. “Let’s see what we can negotiate,” Frederick Go told a media briefing. ( Reuters) China lowers yuan midpoint for sixth day to 19-month low against dollar, signaling PBOC's focus on stability amid trade war. Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said his government could eliminate duties on US products if Washington did the same, the latest overture from the self-run democracy as it seeks to placate its main military backer. “While Taiwan already maintains low tariffs, with an average nominal rate of 6%, we are willing to further cut this rate to zero on the basis of reciprocity with the US,” Lai wrote in a piece for Bloomberg Opinion on Thursday. ( Bloomberg) Taiwan central bank governor Yang Chin-long said that there remained a great amount of uncertainty for the stock market about Trump’s tariffs. A trade war, and reciprocal tariffs, between the United States and China is not good for the global economy, Yang said. But Taiwan continues to hold more than 80% of its foreign exchange reserves in U.S. Treasury bonds, he added. “At present more than 80% is ideal, and we will assess whether to increase it,” Yang said. On Thursday, Taiwan’s benchmark stock index followed global markets higher in response to the tariff reprieve, opening up more than 9%, having plummeted the previous three trading sessions. Taipei-listed shares in TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, as well as those for iPhone maker Foxconn , rebounded close to 10%. Both are major suppliers to U.S. companies, including Apple and Nvidia. “Now that we have an additional 90 days, we can discuss Taiwan-U.S. economic and trade cooperation in a more detailed and in-depth manner. We hope to take advantage of the huge U.S. market, their excellent technology capital and talent, to form a Taiwan-U.S. coalition, a joint fleet approach.” U.S. President Donald Trump’s 90-day pause on most tariffs gives breathing space for more in-depth talks, and Taiwan hopes to take advantage of the “huge” U.S. market for more balanced trade, the island’s foreign minister said on Thursday. ( Reuters) Trump pauses some tariffs, but not on auto imports, drawing criticism from Michigan business and auto groups. Trump's financial advice on social media led to a surge in stocks, raising questions about market manipulation. Understanding financial terms like capitulation, bear market, and dead cat bounce is crucial during economic uncertainty and market fluctuations. US stocks surge after Trump announces temporary tariff pause, easing fears of recession and boosting market confidence. U.S. dollar rebounds against safe-haven currencies after Trump announces tariff pause, escalating trade confrontation with China. Wall Street indexes surge after Trump announces tariff pause, with Dow up 5.76%, S&P 6.46%, Nasdaq 8.04%. President Trump eases tariffs on most nations for 90 days, raises tax rate on Chinese imports to 125%. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra made this remark on Wednesday during a media briefing after the Reserve Bank of India reduced the repo rate by 25 basis points, bringing it down to 6 percent. This marked his second consecutive rate cut since taking charge. The decision followed a three-day Monetary Policy Committee meeting that began on Tuesday. Experts view the move as a step to support the Indian economy amid global uncertainty, especially after the US imposed a 26 percent tariff on Indian imports. The RBI has also shifted its monetary policy stance from ‘neutral’ to ‘accommodative’, leaving room for further rate cuts. China’s commerce ministry slapped restrictions on more than a dozen U.S. defence firms on Wednesday after President Donald Trump made good on his threat to impose an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports. Beijing added 12 U.S. companies to a control list that prohibits exports of dual-use items and another six to its “unreliable entities” list, which allows Beijing to take punitive actions against foreign entities, according to commerce ministry statements. Global shipments of personal computers rose 9.4% in the first quarter of this year as PC makers boosted consignments to the United States in anticipation of President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, research firm Canalys said on Wednesday. As higher tariffs on more countries across the globe take effect, both direct and indirect impacts could dampen a recovery in the PC market for the remainder of the year, Canalys said. PC providers such as Dell and Apple, and chipmakers like Intel, AMD and Qualcomm were relying on demand resurgence for PCs at the back of a Windows refresh cycle and the addition of AI features to drive sales. Amazon.com Inc. has canceled orders for multiple products made in China and other Asian countries, according to a document reviewed by Bloomberg and people familiar with the matter, suggesting the company is reducing its exposure to tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The orders for beach chairs, scooters, air conditioners and other merchandise from multiple Amazon vendors were halted after Trump’s April 2 announcement that he planned to levy tariffs on more than 180 countries and territories, including China, Vietnam and Thailand, the people said. The timing of the cancellations, which had no warning, led the vendors to suspect it was a response to tariffs. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said the administration is considering plans to offer assistance to farmers amid worries that the US-China trade war will have a disastrous effect on American agricultural producers. China announced plans to increase tariffs on all American goods to 84% after President Donald Trump raised duties on Chinese imports to 104%. During a smaller trade fight with Beijing during Trump’s first term, his administration used the Commodity Credit Corporation to offer $28 billion to bail out US farmers. The government-owned and operated entity was created to boost farm income and prices. “We are looking at that again,” Rollins told Bloomberg News Wednesday at the White House. “Obviously everything is on the table, but we’re in such a period of uncertainty in terms of what this looks like.” The Agriculture secretary said, however, that no decisions have been made on whether to extend financial assistance to farmers. Thousands of temporary layoffs at automakers and parts suppliers in Canada are “just the start of it,” warned the country’s largest private-sector union, as the imposition of US tariffs enters its second week. “The industry will not be able to live under these kinds of tariffs. The longer this goes on, the bigger the fallout we’re going to see,” Unifor President Lana Payne said in a Tuesday interview. “My concern is that we see temporary layoffs turn into much longer layoffs.” About 6,000 Unifor members were given short-term layoff notices in the aftermath of Trump’s April 2 announcement, which placed new tariffs on most countries. The majority of the notices came from a Stellantis NV plant in Windsor, Ontario, which makes Chrysler and Dodge vehicles, as part of a two-week shutdown while the company assesses the impact of tariffs. More auto sector businesses have since culled their workforce, including a manufacturer of recreational vehicles that laid off 79 workers last week. truth2.jpg Trump Truth Social Post Wall Street’s main indexes were mixed at the open on Wednesday after China announced more levies on US goods, retaliating to President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs that took effect earlier in the day.

Bessent, speaking to an American Bankers Association conference in Washington, said he would take a lead negotiating role in negotiations over President Donald Trump’s tariffs. He added that despite financial market turmoil, “in general, the companies I’ve spoken to, people who have come, the CEOs, who have come into Treasury, tell me that the economy is very solid.” - Reuters China’s commerce ministry slapped restrictions on more than a dozen US defence firms on Wednesday after President Donald Trump made good on his threat to impose an additional 50 per cent tariff on Chinese imports.

Title: When you can expect price hikes — and how severe they may be

Good morning. If you should ever meet Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, never compare him to Elon Musk. Huang's biographer learned this the hard way. In today's big story, US President Donald Trump's tariffs have gone into effect — we're looking at when you can expect prices to rise, and how severe they may be. What's on deck Markets: Why "The Big Short" investor Steve Eisman thinks the US would prevail in a global trade war. Tech: How grassroots rage at Elon Musk snowballed into global protests. Business: Zillow might not be the place to look for your dream home anymore, thanks to new rules. But first, time for an upgrade? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. $1,549 for an iPhone. After Trump's latest round of tariffs — which went into effect today — UBS's chief investment officer said the Mainland China-assembled iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256 GB would likely see a price hike of $350. The White House's total tariff rate for China now stands at 104%. BI spoke to seven analysts about rising consumer prices and found they expect costs to go up roughly 30% to 50%. It's not just Apple, either. A slew of companies have talked about raising prices due to Trump's tariffs, including Walmart and Target — BI has a running list of them here. Prices on everything from pantry staples like coffee and sugar to larger purchases like cars and appliances are expected to rise. A Yale economist estimated that the cost to the average household could be about $3,800 this year. "Shark Tank" investor Mark Cuban has suggested Americans begin stockpiling goods before prices go up: "From toothpaste to soap, anything you can find storage space for, buy before they have to replenish inventory," Cuban wrote. So, should you take Cuban's advice and stockpile essentials? Some Americans are. BI spoke with people who say they're buying makeup, skincare goods, pet food, spices, meat … the list goes on. Prices might not rise immediately. Companies may think twice before passing on the cost to consumers. Take Apple: Increasing prices could give competitors like Samsung — who are less affected by tariffs — a competitive edge, analyst Thomas Monteiro said. That said, if you know you'll need a new iPhone soon, it's not a bad idea to act now, BI's Ana Altchek writes. 1. "The Big Short" investor is bullish on Trump and the trade war. Steve Eisman thinks the US would win if tariff escalation develops into a full-on trade war. He's also confident President Trump could get everything he wants from negotiations "if reasonable heads prevail." 2. To buy — or not buy — the dip. There might be a glimmer of hope for the investors suffering through the brutal market sell-off. History suggests stocks could very well shake off these losses, and Truist's chief market strategist agrees: "This is not the time to be selling into panic." 3. History lessons about a looming bear market. The S&P 500 briefly entered bear market territory on Monday amid a three-day skid triggered by Trump's tariffs. Goldman Sachs strategists argue the market is now flirting with an event-driven bear market. Here's what to expect if the stock market decisively enters one. 1. Rage against the (Elon Musk) machine. Tesla Takedown protests began sprouting up in February and by the end of March, they had reached more than 250 cities and 13 countries. Here's how anti-Tesla momentum evolved. 2. The angel investors shaking up Silicon Valley. There's a strong correlation between the rising number of women in angel investor markets and more female entrepreneurs receiving angel investing capital. It might be the best way for them to take on tech's billionaire boys club. 3. Microsoft middle managers, beware. The tech giant is considering another round of job cuts that could come as soon as May, BI exclusively reports. This time, it's not just shedding low performers. Leaders on some teams are discussing ousting middle managers, people familiar with the matter told BI. 1. The golden age of Zillow is coming to an end. Thanks to new rules for real estate agents, sites like Zillow and Redfin are about to lose a lot of listings. Your dream home could be for sale — but you may never see it. 2. Top Trump donors are seeing their stock prices plunge. Billionaire CEOs of tech and finance companies shelled out donations to President Trump. Now they're watching their companies' stocks plunge after his tariff announcement. Here's how much they've lost in share value. 3. Trump threatened TSMC with a "big tax." The president said on Tuesday he'd slap Taiwan's chipmaker with a tax of up to 100% if it didn't build its plants in America. TSMC had already announced in March it will invest $100 billion to build five new chip factories in the US.

Title: What does a bear market mean for Big Tech?

Consumers won’t be buying as many gadgets during the potential downturn that’s slamming tech stocks, forecasts Daniel Newman of the Futurum Group. But the tariff-fueled disruption could widen giant companies’ advantage over the rest. After President Donald Trump's launched his “Liberation Day” tariff agenda, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite stock index suffered its biggest plunge since March 2020. The so-called Magnificent 7 — Nvidia, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Tesla — lost a combined $1.8 trillion of market value in two days. The tariff-induced downturn in business conditions is likely to be temporary, according to Daniel Newman, CEO and chief analyst at the Futurum Group, a tech research and advisory firm. Newman told Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino that tech consumers might feel more of the pain, but not much can stop corporate AI adoption and the data center buildout. The following is an edited transcript of their conversation. Daniel Newman: The consumer part of technology, I think, is really at risk with things like PCs and smartphones. We're saying, hey, we're going to build and screw in our iPhones here. Are we ready for $5,000 iPhones? So if I'm on the consumer side and I'm investing in a company like Apple, I'm really nervous right now, and I think this selling pressure on Apple, which has historically been a flight-to-safety name, is evident that people just don't know. They're not confident. And despite its half-trillion-dollar commitments to do more in the U.S. and even its comments about doing more in India, nobody seems to feel comfortable that the consumer demand will be there because that's also tied to things like recession. So that means a lot of things that smaller companies, individuals, buy become more at risk. Now, on the other side of this, I actually have spent time with a number of CEOs in the Big Tech and megacap companies, and both my perspective and theirs is that things like enterprise [artificial intelligence] and the buildout of the AI superhighway of the future, these big data centers — almost tariff-proof. And there's a couple reasons that it is. One is the large companies will double down on R&D and investment during down cycles. This will give them a meaningful advantage, knowing that at some point, no matter where we land with these tariffs, markets will normalize. People will adjust to it, and the markets will start to grow again. This will not be permanent downside. I do not believe it will be permanent downside, but the uncertainty, as long as it lasts, will come with a lot of either up-and-down whipsaw, like I said, or continued consternation, because the CEOs I talked to are also in a somewhat difficult position to make decisions. But the AI data center build, if I'm looking at companies like Nvidia, if I'm looking at companies like Microsoft that have relatively low consumer exposure, I'm feeling more optimistic. Meghan McCarty Carino: What exactly makes the data center business kind of tariff-proof? I think about kind of physical infrastructure building, we've heard a lot about how the housing market and, you know, building residential could become a lot more expensive. Data centers are also made of stuff that could be tariffed. Newman: Yeah, obviously there's a lot of kind of speculation, some of the continuation of USMCA and the no-tariffs-on-semiconductors [policy] right now is enabling a lot of at least fundamental belief before 232 is fully unpacked, and a longer-term semiconductor decision is being made that you could basically ship chips into the U.S. or Mexico, have these things assembled and avoid tariffs. Now, again, that's just the racks. That doesn't count all the other things that go into a data center. Steel, of course, you know, you've got major workforce issues. You know, we've got, obviously, the two sides of the immigration debate. We know what we're trying to accomplish with safety and security of our borders. But also we know that a large part of workforce that do things like build homes and buildings, maybe we have less access to that type of workforce, bringing input costs up. Of course, all the other things that go into these buildouts and facilities, energy, all things that are going to be up for debate in terms. But realistically, it's about the fact that companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, they have massive operating leverage, and so during this sort of market recession or downturn, they will separate themselves from startups that may have trouble raising meaningful capital, from midsize and growing competitors in the middle of the market that won't be able to invest as heavily. They can build out their data centers faster. They can have the capacity in place. And knowing that this tech is deflationary, I think that's kind of it. There's a tariff element to it, and then there's a fact that companies can actually be more profitable by implementing tech. We saw this in 2022 in the downturn when [quantitative tightening] started, software investment in many companies went up. They invested heavily in platforms that were either automation platforms, analytics platforms that could allow them to more efficiently make decisions while keeping head counts in place. And we actually saw from 2022 to 2024, Big Tech didn't really raise head counts, even though earnings grew considerably. McCarty Carino: When it comes to share prices, I think a lot of people are sort of like playing a tiny violin for these companies with the biggest market caps in the world. The market caps are slightly smaller than they were, but still absolutely enormous. But, I mean, at a kind of basic level, why are capital markets important to any company, but especially to tech companies? Newman: Well, I mean, there's a few different reasons capital markets are important. Of course, there's the literal ability to continually raise needed capital to run the business. These large companies don't have as much of that type of need. They're also a litmus test for how the market perceives a certain company or a certain category. And of course, it's also part of, at least as I see it, American exceptionalism, that the U.S. companies are seen as the world's most valuable companies. [The capital markets are] also full of sort of abnormal actions over short periods of time. But over long periods of time, the market does tend to be a very strong indicator for these companies and for the health of an economy and the health of businesses. McCarty Carino: And for that reason, U.S. capital markets, and especially tech stocks, have been a good place to put money for investors all over the world. That is good for our companies that they attract investment. So what does it mean for tech companies for markets to potentially be in bear territory? Newman: Well, for the tech companies, I think most of these, especially these Mag 7 and large tech companies, I think it really just means battening down the hatches, staying really focused, investing in the right [research and development], not overleveraging and continuing to serve the customers and deliver the innovation and solutions that has gotten them to where they're going. These large companies have incredible operating leverage. And you look at some of them, like Nvidia is supposed to create $100 billion in cash in the next year. Their share price dropping and their market cap going from $3.5 trillion to $2.5 trillion doesn't change their ability to function and operate. And I think these companies have strong [barriers to competition], they have strong customer bases, they have strong margins, and even in periods of recessions, they're generally growing their earnings. Now the expectation for earnings growth sometimes slows, but these companies have strong businesses that continue to grow. They continue to create cash flow. And I think over time, if you can handle the kind of the uncertainty and buy when things seem most uncomfortable, there's endless history and proof points that people that bought during these times do a lot better than those that sort of chase these names into bull markets. McCarty Carino: We've been talking about Big Tech, but what are the kind of ripple effects for little tech, for startups in this kind of an environment? Newman: There's a lot more risk for smaller companies and small tech. You got to watch for a signal. You know, we work with 600 of the world's largest tech companies. The signal that we look for as a smaller company working with many of the larger ones is, when does their spending slow down? Meaning, do you start to see meaningful behavior changes coming from your larger clients? Are they actually slowing their spending down? That signal is often one that smaller tech companies need to look at. You need to be on top of how technology can help. You need to be very focused on delivering great value to your existing customers and just listen to your large customers, because they will tell you. The large customers tend to know when they need to slow spending and when they start slowing spending, you need to slow spending for sure. McCarty Carino: This isn't the first shock that the tech sector has weathered. In fact, the tech sector seems to have more of them than other industries. How would you sort of put this in perspective of the kind of history of ups and downs in the tech industry and what we can kind of learn from those? Newman: We're going to go through cycles every handful of years. And actually, with the diffusion of innovation speeding up, and the diffusion of information speeding up, I actually think cycles happen at more rapid pace. But the one thing I think we all tend to underestimate is sort of the perseverance. You know, the human condition is we come back from adversity and we come back stronger. The tariffs obviously impact technology, but we will accelerate, and we will continue to innovate, and it will be technology that will get us out of these most difficult situations. It's proven time and time again. So owning the names in tech, it's very hard to bet against over the long term.

Title: Shawn Fain Is Right. America Needs to Rethink Trade.

Activate your online access Trump’s tariff war is chaotic, but there is no way out of neoliberal globalization without some form of protectionism. A shipping container is moved at the Port Jersey Container Terminal in Jersey City, New Jersey on April 8, 2025. United Auto Workers (UAW) president Shawn Fain has many liberals scratching their heads. The longtime critic of Donald Trump who wore a “TRUMP IS A SCAB” T-shirt at the Democratic National Convention last year has come out in support of the president’s favorite economic policy: tariffs. Despite the fact that other leading progressives have expressed extreme alarm at Trump’s plans, Fain has insisted that tariffs are “a tool in the toolbox…to bring jobs back here, and, you know, invest in the American workers.” He’s right, and he’s not alone in thinking this. A group of self-proclaimed “economic patriots” on the left are making a similar case in Congress. Representative Chris Deluzio, a Democrat from Western Pennsylvania who won election in the state’s most competitive district, recently took to The New York Times to plead with his party not to embrace “anti-tariff absolutism” as a response to Trump’s policies. And Representative Jared Golden, a Democrat from a rural Trump-leaning district in Maine, recently made a similar case, arguing, “Tariffs are a first step in rewriting a rigged trade system.” Tariffs are part of any sound trade policy. The way they work is simple: By raising the prices of foreign goods, you make domestic goods more attractive to domestic consumers, thus increasing demand and expanding homegrown production. Of course, Trump’s tariffs are erratic, and their intended purpose is unclear. They will likely do more harm than good. But that doesn’t mean protectionism is inherently a bad idea. In fact, if the left cannot offer a compelling exit from neoliberal globalization, it will be unable to effectively combat the GOP’s national populism with a social populism of its own. Rethinking trade must be a central part of a pro-worker agenda. For many union members, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) marks the beginning of US decline. The agreement made it so that money, goods, and labor could flow more freely across the continent. Since it was enthusiastically signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1993, manufacturing jobs have drained out of the United States to lower-wage corners of the globe. And NAFTA wasn’t even the worst of it; a succession of trade deals followed, including the admission of China into the World Trade Organization. This led to a collapse of manufacturing jobs in the United States. In the 30 years since, around 90,000 US manufacturing plants have been shuttered. The impact on the labor movement has been disastrous. In 1990, around 20 percent of workers in the US belonged to a union; by 2024 that rate had plummeted to around 9 percent, a record low. The decline of manufacturing and union density combined with looser border restrictions that invited hyper-exploited foreign-born workers into the United States have crushed wages, which have been stagnant for non-college-educated workers. By swapping high-wage often union jobs in manufacturing, for low-wage nonunion jobs in services, free trade has effectively robbed the working class of its social, political, and economic power. Few industrial unions have been as affected as the UAW. Since the 1990s, the autoworkers have witnessed over 60 major plant closures among the Big Three automakers. Membership in the union peaked at around 1.5 million in 1979. Today, the UAW has around 390,000 members—a 74 percent decrease. Worse, even when the union manages to make inroads in new plants, companies always have an exit option. They can pack up and relocate to places where labor is cheaper. What’s more, layoffs and plant closures have had a devastating effect on the towns and cities that depended on industrial wages and investments. While some economists insist that job losses in manufacturing have been offset by the arrival of cheap goods from China (and ever-rising stock prices), they discount the devastating social, psychological, and political effects of plant closures. The mounting “deaths of despair” and rise of opioid addiction, concentrated in working-class former industrial cities and towns, indicate a social rot that began with the country’s embrace of free trade. Politically, despite Bill Clinton’s and Barack Obama’s confidence that a super-charged global “knowledge economy” would generate broad-based prosperity that would reward progressives, the results have not been good for Democrats. In fact, as wages stagnated, working-class voters have drifted away from the party. No Democratic candidate for president has ever matched Bill Clinton’s level of support with these voters. Lyndon Johnson feared that he lost the South for a generation by passing civil rights laws, but liberals seem unaware that by signing NAFTA, Democrats did the same for blue-collar workers. Obama even tried to deepen the disaster with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was never ratified. By 2016, the populist backlash had arrived. Both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders slammed the establishment for disastrous trade deals. And both won a larger share of working-class voters than their establishment counterparts. And the United States wasn’t alone. A recent meta-analysis by political scientists, led by Gábor Scheiring at Georgetown University, found that the surge in populism all over the world is driven by a reaction against the insecurity induced by globalization. While debate remains over whether workers were driven away from the left because of economic issues or cultural ones, with globalization the two phenomena are linked—the same market forces that drove manufacturing to extinction also helped to drive the increasing pace of cultural churn. Of course, globalization didn’t only generate losers. Skilled professionals have done well under free trade. Those with advanced degrees plugged into the knowledge-city hubs that dot the globe have seen salary increases over the last 30 years, and they’ve reaped significant consumer rewards as well, from the arrival of cheaper foreign goods to the arrival of cheaper foreign labor, like nannies and maids. One consequence of their relative economic success, however, is that the educated middle classes have pulled away from the working class socially, politically, and culturally. Ironically, as the white-collar class became more liberal, they became less aware of the economic interests or aspirations of their blue-collar counterparts—which explains their constant exasperation that someone of modest means might vote for Trump. Not only this, but because of the nature of their work, professionals maintain effective control of the means of cultural production, and they’ve, perhaps unwittingly, imposed their own aesthetic and cosmopolitan tastes on the broader public. One way to think of the culture wars is as a process of elite cultural reeducation. The academy, the media, and the sprawling nonprofit industrial complex has, since the 1990s, insisted upon new ways of speaking, writing, and thinking that quickly become litmus tests for whether one is considered moral by the liberal literati. This process has only exacerbated working-class resentment: Not only has globalization not worked out for the working class economically, but culturally they’re now expected to ape the values of their social betters. But none have benefited as much as Wall Street, the über-rich, and the multinational mega-corporations. The wealthy reap rewards on both sides of the globalization gambit. They rake in record profits off cheap labor in foreign countries where unions and workplace rights are weak or nonexistent. And they benefit from the privileged position the new global order affords them. The freedom to invest and divest in whatever country they choose gives the rich immense power over the world’s poor, whose governments clamor to attract new investment by depressing wages and promising investors freedom from taxes and regulation. The result is that the rich have grown much richer. In 1990, CEOs made roughly 76 times what their typical employee made, by 2023 that number grew to 290 times. Over the same period, the number of billionaires in the United States has grown by more than 1,000 percent. Since 2024 their wealth, through the magic of finance, has grown by $3.9 trillion. These numbers are mind-boggling, but as Labor Institute director Les Leopold usefully put it: “If you earned $1,000 per hour, it would take you 68.5 years to reach $1 billion.” Put another way, you don’t earn a billion dollars. You steal it. What’s been the upshot for the economy overall? Nothing great. As the population of billionaires ballooned, the high growth rates promised by free-trade enthusiasts never arrived. Larry Summers, once an economic adviser to the hyper-globalizing Clinton administration, has recently expressed doubt in the possibility for renewed global growth. Superrich people, it seems, are far more likely to save their money than plow it into engines of economic dynamism. Meanwhile, the rest of us don’t have adequate wages to spend. The suppression of mass demand means that, as The Wall Street Journal recently reported, “The U.S. Economy Depends More Than Ever on Rich People.” And all because neoliberal globalization broke the back of labor all over the world. As the German political economist Wolfgang Streeck said, “Without trade unions, no mass purchasing power; without mass purchasing power, no investment.” And what about Mexico? Some of globalization’s dead-enders insist that without free trade, workers in countries like Mexico would be a lot poorer. But even this seems dubious. For years the unwritten accord with Mexican auto workers was that, while they would have lower wages than their American counterparts, their plants would employ a lot more labor. Wages would be spread around. Yet today high-tech automation imported from all over the globe is employed to displace Mexican workers—a phenomenon known as “premature deindustrialization.” Mexican workers have suffered hyper-exploitation at the hands of foreign multinational corporations for decades, and now those same corporations are laying off the cheap labor they relied on to lay off American workers. It’s clear, after 30 years, this system isn’t working for the working class. This brings us back to Shawn Fain. Fain knows that Trump’s tariffs are dangerous. He knows that chaos creates economic risks. He knows that Trump’s anti-labor record is not going to benefit US or foreign workers. But he also knows that there is a big division in the political and business class right now, and he’s keen to exploit it. Wall Street hates the tariffs; the political establishment hates the tariffs; even Elon Musk seems to hate the tariffs. Trump’s signature economic policy has the potential to crack up his coalition. It’s in moments like these that a new common sense can form. In some ways the post-globalized order is already here. Global trade has stagnated since the 2008 crisis, and the public has no appetite for another NAFTA-type free-trade agreement. Yet what comes next is uncertain. Right now, in the debate over trade there seem to be only two voices: Wall Street or Trump. Fain offers a better vision than both. Dave Zirin Alex Peter Jeet Heer Photo Essay / David Bacon Fain is right when he argues that auto manufacturers can afford to eat the tariffs without passing on price hikes. Consider that, despite labor-saving automation, manufacturers were charging record prices for a new car before tariffs—in some cases 10 points above the general inflation rate. Where is that money going? Into auto-industry profits that have grown over 50 percent since 2019—despite depressed sales. Fain is right that the industry has “excess capacity” and that tariffs “could bring work back in very short order” by reopening recently closed or underutilized plants. And he’s right that tariffs, combined with an effective industrial policy, could boost workers’ wages, not just in the auto industry but across the board. But more than all of this, Fain is right that we need to restore democratic sovereignty over our economy. The kind of protectionism he envisions has been a “tool in the toolbox” throughout the history of the labor movement. In some ways it’s the foundational idea of progressive economics. Alexander Hamilton, who was so recently the subject of much liberal admiration, was a huge fan of tariffs. So was the most important progressive economist of all time, John Maynard Keynes. And as the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik argues, the major “trilemma” of the free-trade regime is precisely that we cannot maintain “hyperglobalization, democracy, and national sovereignty all at once; we can have at most, two out of three.” Too many liberals are now rejoicing at Wall Street’s rejection of the tariffs as if “the markets” are a substitute for democratic input. But plunging stocks only prove what we already knew: that high finance is loath to get off the free-trade gravy train. The turmoil itself demonstrates how hard it is to implement any kind of economic control over the financial paymasters, and it will surely signal to many of Trump’s supporters that he is taking on the elite. It’s right to be clear-eyed about Trump’s recklessness; indeed, Keynes warned that a move away from globalism “should not be a matter of tearing up roots but of slowly training a plant to grow in a different direction.” Trump has no patience for that, but the left can’t fall into the trap of letting Wall Street set the terms of the debate. To match Trump’s national populism, we need a social populism of our own. We should not retreat to advocating for free trade as a response to stock market panic but advance to a conversation about industrial planning. We need a program that seeks to repatriate American finance, claw back the trillions in taxes lost to offshore banking, and reinvest in US jobs. The tariff is one of the tools we need to rebuild the economy in favor of the working class. Dustin Guastella is a research associate at the Center for Working Class Politics and the Director of Operations for Teamsters Local 623. A president who bullies Congress kowtows to the bond market. Jeet Heer I don’t know exactly what went down in the hours before Trump publicly announced a “pause” on tariffs, but it merits investigation. Sasha Abramsky The fallout from Trump’s tariff plans has pitted the Republican financial elite against MAGA culture warriors in a way that threatens to split the coalition. Chris Lehmann The president’s tariff war is also a constitutional crisis. Jeet Heer The economy took an immediate hit after the president’s “Liberation Day ”announcement.

Title: On the Opaque Origins and Tumultuous Ancient History of Homer’s Odyssey

Full Content:
In some ways, the Odyssey needs no introduction: it is everywhere around us. Over the nearly thirty centuries since Homer’s thrilling epic about the hero Odysseus’s homecoming from the Trojan War began to circulate, its story, characters, and themes have become so tightly woven into the fabric of our literature and art, music and drama, that they seem to us inevitable, natural. It’s with a start that we recall that someone had to invent them. Whether you’re reading Virgil’s Aeneid or watching The Wizard of Oz or Finding Nemo, you are enjoying a story that borrows the Odyssey’s plot: a hero, separated from home and loved ones, must wander among strange peoples and fantastical places during a difficult and often dangerous journey before arriving at last to reclaim both family and homeland. As you make your way through Dante’s Inferno, J.D. Salinger’s The Catcher in the Rye, or Stephen King’s Stand by Me, you are following a metaphorical arc first traced by Homer: the journey through space and time as a symbol for intellectual growth and discovery, for a deepening appreciation of the relationship of the self to the world, for the trajectory, finally, that we all follow from birth to death. The most suspenseful and exciting of the Odyssey’s plot twists—when the hero finally returns, he is in disguise and can thus secretly test the loyalty of those he left behind—has been endlessly recycled, from authors such as Alexandre Dumas (The Count of Monte Cristo) to filmmakers such as Ridley Scott (Gladiator). And the climactic testing of the Odyssey’s hero, who must prove both his identity and his worthiness to assume his destined role by meeting a series of challenges both physical and mental, has resurfaced in modern epics like Harry Potter and Game of Thrones. The Odyssey bequeathed to the West entire genres. The poem’s fascination with the alien creatures and unfamiliar cultures that its wandering hero confronts was the seed from which both fantasy literature and science fiction would eventually blossom; Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and Star Trek share strands of an Odyssean DNA. The Odyssey also established the blueprint for the picaresque novel, whose rollicking narratives about sly characters barely scraping their way through a series of hair-raising escapades, from Don Quixote to The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, echo Odysseus’s progress from Troy (where the ingenious ruse he dreamed up, the Trojan Horse, won the war) through encounters with monsters, seductresses, and ghosts, to Ithaka, the home he strives so hard to reach. The marital drama of Odysseus and his wife, Penelope—a couple agonizingly separated, the man and woman each facing different kinds of peril, eventually reunited only after a tense test of wits proves to each that the other is an ideal mate—contains the germ of all romantic comedy. The pleasure readers experience when Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy finally come together at the end of Pride and Prejudice is a direct descendant of an emotion experienced by Homer’s audience thirty centuries ago as they listened to a bard sing of the reunion of Ithaka’s royal couple, fully revealed to each other at last after a separation of twenty years. The Odyssey has provided inspiration for a number of important modernist and contemporary authors. James Joyce’s 1922 classic Ulysses (the title uses the Roman name for Homer’s wandering hero) is composed of sections that are both named for and modeled on episodes of Homer’s epic: “Circe,” “Proteus,” “Lotos-Eaters,” and so forth. Motifs and characters from both the Iliad and the Odyssey resurface in Omeros, a 1990 epic poem on themes of colonialism and the Atlantic slave trade by the St. Lucian writer Derek Walcott, winner of the Nobel Prize, while the American poet Louise Glück, also a Nobel laureate, examined a collapsing marriage through a retelling of the Odyssey in her 1996 collection Meadowlands. More recently, numerous women writers have taken the epic’s female characters and reimagined the events of Homer’s story from their points of view. In books such as Margaret Atwood’s Penelopiad and Madeline Miller’s Circe, the reorientation of narrative perspective reminds us that the ancient works, originally composed by men for primarily male audiences, are nonetheless rich in complex female characters whose literary potential is still being tapped. The large themes of Homer’s epic have proved to be enduring ones. The poem’s presentation of Odysseus as someone whose desperation to return home is tempered by an endless curiosity about the strange places through which he wanders provokes questions about how we navigate between the allure of adventure and the satisfactions of home. The depiction of the poem’s protagonist as a gritty survivor who—in stark contrast to the haughty warriors of the Iliad, for whom dying young in battle is a fair price to pay for everlasting glory—will stoop to virtually anything in order to stay alive demands that we reevaluate what we mean by the word “hero.” Odysseus’s fraught interactions with immortals such as the nymph Kalypso, whose offer of eternal life and youth he rejects in favor of returning to his aging wife, force us, like the hero, to grapple with the meaning of mortality and the value of human love, even as his relationships with his wife, his bedmates, his son, and his father offer insights into the relations between men and women, parents and children. And the epic’s complex portrayal of its morally ambivalent main character—a man whose impressive intellectual gifts, technological expertise, and “godlike” cunning nonetheless very often leave destruction and sorrow in their wake—often reads like a dark parable about Western civilization itself. The Odyssey further displays a marked interest in a subject that some readers are more likely to associate with the work of twentieth-century modernist writers: the workings of language and rhetoric, the nature of poetry and literature. Odysseus’s expertise as a talented raconteur (and, when the occasion demands, an expert liar), along with the epic’s many scenes of him and other characters telling, exchanging, and enjoying a tale whose point is clearly self-serving, raises tricky questions about the uses of narrative and its relationship to truth. Meanwhile, the Odyssey’s frequent references to and depictions of poets, singers, and bards, along with repeated episodes in which professional bards—like Homer himself—give performances on whose formal qualities and emotional power other characters comment, can lend the proceedings a startlingly “meta,” even postmodern feel. Strikingly modern, too, is the Odyssey’s sophisticated inquiry into the nature of identity. The vehicle for that investigation is the poem’s constantly shifting presentation of its chameleon-like hero, whose adeptness at both falsifying his appearance and fictionalizing his life story makes it almost impossible to trust what we think we know about him—and, hence, impossible to know who he is. The issue is slyly raised already in the Odyssey’s opening line, which avoids naming its protagonist, referring to him instead simply as “a man.” Not very helpfully, that same first line allots this nameless man precisely one adjective—polytropos, literally “having many twists and turns”—which, at once vague and yet suggestive of endless possibilities, seems intended simultaneously to illuminate and to confound our understanding of just who this man might be. Over the twelve thousand one hundred nine lines that follow that opening, we see so many “turns” or facets of this character that it sometimes feels as if he is becoming more, rather than less, difficult to grasp as his story proceeds. * And so we can read the Odyssey today with a bracing sense of déjà vu: we feel we know these narratives, we have met these characters, we recognize these themes. Yet the epic of Odysseus’s return is, in many ways, as unfathomably strange to us as the one-eyed giant Cyclops was to its hero. Its origins, even after centuries of scholarly investigations, are opaque, its poetic conventions sometimes off puttingly foreign, certain of its values passé when not outright repugnant. Small wonder. The Odyssey is the product of the civilization of Archaic Greece—that is, Greece before the classical era, before the “golden age” of Pericles, Greek tragedy, Athenian democracy, the Parthenon. That civilization flourished between around 750 BCE, when the Iliad and the Odyssey likely began circulating, and around 500 BCE—the moment when the Athenian democracy was established. But the civilization described in the Odyssey had flourished another half millennium earlier, in the final stage of the Late Bronze Age (ca. 1600—1150 BCE). This was the civilization of Greek kingdoms such as Mycenae, Argos, Tiryns, and Pylos, of the luxurious and sophisticated cities of Knossos on Crete and of Troy in Asia Minor. These states, known as “palace-cultures,” were organized around a royal palace, or megaron, as the center of social, political, and economic activity, and each palace was presided over by its warrior-king. The principal characters in both the Iliad and Odyssey are such kings: Odysseus of Ithaka, Achilles of Phthía, Nestor of Pylos, Menelaos of Sparta, Agamemnon of Mycenae. Between 1200 and 1150 BCE, nearly all these cities were destroyed, probably as the result of both natural disasters (drought, earthquakes, fires) and of economic and political upheavals. During the centuries after the fall of the Bronze Age palace-cultures—a period of such greatly reduced literacy and such minimal large-scale building and craft production that it was long referred to as Greece’s “Dark Ages”—the tales Homer would later tell about the Trojan War began circulating, aglow with idealized reminiscences of the civilization that had so suddenly vanished. These tales eventually coalesced into a grand sequence of epic verse narratives known as the Epic Cycle. Composed by various poets and together comprising many tens of thousands of lines and at least seventy-seven “books”—that is, papyrus scrolls—this cycle traced the arc of the war from its distant prehistory (the wedding of the parents of Achilles, the Greeks’ greatest warrior) through its proximate cause (the Trojan prince Paris’s seduction of Helen, the wife of the Spartan king Menelaos), to the events of the Trojan War itself, culminating in the Sack of Troy; and thereafter the adventures of a number of the Greek warriors as they returned home (related in an epic known as the Nostoi, or “Returns”). The final bizarre ramification of the cycle’s most attenuated plotline was the slaying of Odysseus, in his old age, by his son Telégonos, his child by the witch Circe, related in a work called the Telegony, at the conclusion of which Telégonos marries Penelope and Telémakhos marries Circe(!). Of this cycle, only fragments and summaries survive. The only two complete epics about the Trojan War that have come down to us are the Iliad, about events that took place during the final year of the war, and the Odyssey, about the nostos, or “return,” of one particular hero. Scholars continue to debate the relationship between those two epics and the Epic Cycle: which came first, and which inspired the other. As distant as they were from each other, both the civilization that the Odyssey commemorates and the civilization that produced the epic shared a number of features that are profoundly alien to modern sensibilities. For one thing, both were deeply patriarchal cultures. Although they played key roles in religion and cults, women had no political rights or status, could not own property, and were themselves often little more than chattel, objects of exchange whose chief role was to produce children and perform homely domestic tasks. (Even the queens in the Homeric epics, from Helen of Troy to Penelope, are often depicted engaged in spinning and weaving; so, too, the goddesses Kalypso and Circe.) The economies of these cultures, moreover, were based largely on the labor of enslaved people—prisoners taken in war, victims of forced abductions—who, like many of the slaves depicted in both the Iliad and the Odyssey, spent their lives performing work both domestic and agricultural for masters who expected their loyalty as a matter of course. Hence, like other great works of literature from remote eras and different cultures, the Homeric epics present us with a classic conundrum: How can a work that seems to speak with such truth about so much that matters to us have been produced by a culture with certain institutions and values so alien to us? Only an attentive reading of the poem can begin to forge an answer to that question. As to the poem’s formal conventions, they are likely to strike modern readers as equally inscrutable. You don’t have to progress very far into the text before you notice a number of peculiarities unlike anything familiar from other literary encounters. Of these, the high degree of repetition is likely to be the most striking. Not only do most characters have descriptive epithets that are repeated nearly every time their names appear—“Athena of the bright owl-eyes,” “Telémakhos, sensible lad,” “Penelope, clear-thinking woman”—but entire lines and even whole passages are repeated, verbatim, throughout the poem. Scenes of feasting, for instance, nearly always include the line “Then they stretched out their hands toward the food that was spread before them,” while the end of the meal is just as regularly signaled by the phrase “But once they had put away their craving for drink and for food…” Between those two moments, Homer often repeats the following five-line passage, describing the dinner preparations and service: A maidservant brought in water, pouring it out from a ewer— Exquisite, wrought in gold—into a basin of silver, For the guest to wash his hands. Then she placed a table nearby. The housekeeper, worthy woman, brought the meal and served it, Glad to have so many dishes to set out from her storerooms inside. (1.136–40) Such devices were, in fact, almost certainly the products of the distinctive manner in which the epics were composed and transmitted—which is to say, not in writing but orally. The texts of both epics were long thought to have been the work of a single genius named Homer, who wrote his poems. Scholars began to reconsider the origins of the poems, however, in the late eighteenth century, when a manuscript of the Iliad containing not only the text of the epic but transcriptions of the “scholia”—the marginal notes by various ancient commentators that had accreted over the centuries—was discovered in Venice. These precious annotations were of enormous value in their own right, since relatively little has survived of the vast body of ancient scholarship and commentary on Homer, which was often impressively erudite. (The Roman geographer Strabo, a contemporary of the emperor Augustus, makes reference to a thirty-volume work by someone called Demetrius of Skepsis that treated just sixty-two lines of the second book of the Iliad.) But what was so exciting about the marginalia in the Venetian manuscript was that many of the notes, which referred to a number of ancient editions of the poems, concerned questions that the ancient commentators had about the authenticity of certain lines and passages. If the epics had been penned by a single author, scholars wondered, why were there so many variants already in ancient times? Could the authentic text by Homer be recovered by judiciously sifting through the variant versions? By the early nineteenth century, the Venetian manuscript and the writings of those who had studied it were roiling the intellectual and literary worlds by raising a different set of questions. What if there were no authentic Homeric versions of the poems—what if, indeed, there had been no Homer in the first place? As the century progressed, more and more classicists were persuaded that the epics must originally have been composed by illiterate oral poets in an era before the Greeks adopted an alphabet and writing became widespread; the Iliad and Odyssey, they argued, could not have been the work of a single bard but instead represented an accumulation of smaller, self-contained poems (or “lays”) composed by different poets of different eras. Adherents of one school of thought, known as “Analysts”—from the Greek word analyô, “to break [something] down into its component parts”—claimed to be able to distinguish among the various strata of composition in each of the epics; some insisted that they could make out “original” versions of the poems lurking beneath the layers. The Analysts were opposed by so-called “Unitarians,” who continued to insist that the poems, whatever flaws in consistency and irregularities in style and coherence they might occasionally display, were the product of a single genius. The debate about the authorship and transmission of the epics, known as the “Homeric Question,” raged on into the twentieth century. In the 1920s and 1930s, a classicist named Milman Parry proposed a theory, based on an insight he had into Homer’s verbatim repetitions, that transformed the way we understand how the epics were composed. Parry suggested that those repeated lines, passages, and epithets—the latter almost always occurring in the same position within a line of verse—must have functioned as prefabricated placeholders for oral poets who composed their works in performance. The rigidly formulaic nature of the repetitions, he argued, were traces of a poetic process that combined memorization of traditional elements with improvisation: if the bard knew in advance how a line was going to end—“Zeus, who marshals the clouds,” say—or could count on being able to insert a formulaic passage of several lines, he could devote his energies to what we might think of as the “creative” parts. (It is worth noting, however, that within an oral tradition, a poet’s canny manipulation of traditional formulas and scenes could itself be considered creative.) Parry bolstered his hypothesis by drawing parallels between Homer’s epics and the epic verse of contemporary Yugoslav bards whom he had studied, who adapted and improvised on traditional material in the way he believed the Homeric performers may well have done. Most contemporary classicists, it seems safe to say, accept Parry’s core theory about the oral tradition in which the Homeric epics evolved. The poems likely began as relatively short compositions by preliterate bards who drew on traditional material—legends about the Trojan War, folklore about stock figures (wily tricksters, man-eating ogres, sage old kings), myths about the various gods—to fashion their songs. With each performance, they might elaborate on earlier compositions, refining and adding, even as they continued to rely on and employ traditional diction, epithets, and stock phrases and scenes. (Passages in the poem where a given epithet fits the meter but doesn’t fit the occasion were, according to Parry, traces of the poems’ origins as oral performances) As successive generations of poet-performers kept adding new material to their own and their peers’ works, individual lays—Achilles’ quarrel with Agamemnon over the enslaved captive Briseis, say, or Odysseus’s encounter with the Cyclops—presumably began to coalesce into larger works with grander arcs and themes: the climactic struggles of the Trojan War and what they tell us about the nature of human striving and mortality, Odysseus’s return from the war after twenty years and what it tells us about time and identity, family and home. Eventually, these increasingly vast works were committed to writing, possibly by a gifted poet-editor who collated the various versions known to him and assembled them into something like their present form. Just when this happened is, typically, up for debate. One theory that was long prevalent—based, in part, on comments by ancient authors such as Cicero—was that the first definitive written texts of the epics were compiled in the late 500s BCE on the orders of the Athenian ruler Peisístratos, who was keen to institute a recitation of the epics as part of a grand civic festival known as the Panathenaia. (For some scholars, this explains why a minor character in the Odyssey is called Peisístratos: an ingratiating nod to the event’s sponsor.) Such festivals, along with religious occasions, funeral games, and Panhellenic gatherings such as the quadrennial athletic games, were important venues for public recitations of the epics as well as other works. These performances, quite different from the intimate recitals in the courts of kings and nobles that are depicted in the epics themselves, were a vital part of Greek cultural life from the Archaic period on. The men who performed the recitations were known as rhapsodes, a term likely derived from the Greek verb “to stitch together,” presumably because they would piece together the mythic and folkloric material they inherited, the lays and various episodes, the traditional lines and formulas, into their compositions. Ancient texts refer to a law enacted by a son of Peisístratos requiring that the epics be performed in their entirety at the Panathenaia, each work being divided into parts that were assigned to the rhapsodes by lot, with successive rhapsodes reciting the different sections in order. For this to happen, of course, there needed to be a fixed text. And yet, it is clear that numerous versions and variants continued to circulate and the poems continued to evolve. Starting in the early 200s BCE, the plethora of such variants in the collections of the Library of Alexandria convinced the scholars who worked there that it was imperative to create a definitive critical edition of the poems. The version they and their successors produced eventually became the basis of a standard edition, widely circulated throughout the classical world and eventually copied and recopied by hand over the next millennium and a half, until the invention of the printing press. The first printed edition of the Odyssey was published in 1488, in Florence. All this helps to explain why the existence of “Homer”—the blind bard who, people thought for centuries, single-handedly composed both the Iliad and the Odyssey—is now questioned. Today, the name has become a convenient way of referring to all the obscure processes by means of which a loose collection of legends about the Trojan War and its aftermath were transformed, over time, into the two great epics we have today: masterpieces of astonishing structural complexity and coherence, great dramatic power, and profound insight into the human condition. (I will use “Homer” in this way.) Indeed, whatever the controversies about the identity of the epics’ poet (or poets), whatever the debates about the date and manner of their composition, there has never been disagreement, either ancient or modern, about the importance of the two Homeric epics. Through two millennia of Greek civilization, they remained the twin foundations of Hellenic culture, from the Archaic Era through the collapse of the Byzantine Empire, twenty centuries later: an essential part of education, the inspiration or models for much if not most subsequent literary and dramatic works, revered as sources of insight into subjects from ethics to medical treatments, and enjoying the supreme status and exerting the pervasive influence on Western culture that we associate with the Hebrew Bible and New Testament, which the Homeric poems eventually joined as the foundations of European civilization. __________________________________ Reprinted with permission from The Odyssey by Homer and translated, with an Introduction and Notes by Daniel Mendelsohn, published by the University of Chicago Press.

Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts—such as options or futures—that have not been settled. It’s a measure of market activity and liquidity. In this chart, the metric is Open Interest / Market Cap, which shows how much derivatives trading (through open interest) exists relative to the total size (market cap) of the asset or company. Here’s what this means in practice: • SPY at 180.1%: The open interest in SPY options is 180.1% of SPY’s market cap. That signals extremely high speculative or hedging activity. • MSTR at 78.2%: MicroStrategy has a high level of speculative interest relative to its market size—likely due to its Bitcoin exposure. • AAPL at 3.2%: Apple has a much lower level of open interest compared to its market cap, which suggests less leverage/speculation relative to its massive size. Why it matters: • High open interest ratios can suggest heavy speculative positioning or hedging. • Low ratios might indicate a more passive investor base or less speculative attention.
