Title: Want to Understand the New Cold War? Look to Huawei.

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access The tech company has come to symbolize the ongoing struggle between America and China. A Huawei store in Beijing, 2024. America’s political and economic elites were once unruffled by the rise of China. Yes, Chinese GDP was growing fast, and yes, China’s share of global trade was growing equally rapidly. But this did not—or, at least, did not seem to—challenge America’s ongoing economic dominance. After all, the dollar was still king. The size and depth of China’s stock market continued to be dwarfed by the United States’. GDP per capita still weighed heavily in America’s favor. And the acknowledged global heavyweights of Big Tech—Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft—were American companies one and all. The basic posture vis-à-vis China was the following: You keep producing all that cheap stuff, we’ll keep on buying it, and you keep on financing the deficits that we accrue in the process. Over the last decade, all of this has unraveled. During his first term in the White House, Donald Trump introduced a series of tariffs on Chinese imports, which sparked retaliatory measures from China and growing talk of a “trade war.” Under Joe Biden, the inflammatory language of the Trump 1.0 era became less conspicuous. Rather, in a break with the hegemony of neoliberalism, the Biden White House hailed a renaissance in “industrial policy”; his flacks talked about no longer being able to rely on market mechanisms to guide investment. But even if the tone had changed, the policy content was not much different: China was in the crosshairs. If anything, Biden’s China tariffs were more severe than those he inherited. In mid-2024, tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum were raised to 25 percent, on solar cells and panels to 50 percent, on electric vehicles to 100 percent; and in a parting gift to his successor, in January 2025, just as Biden was leaving office, a 50 percent tariff on Chinese semiconductors went into effect. Notably, green technology was at the heart of Biden’s trade and China policy. In explaining his tariff hikes and their sectoral concentration, the Biden team repeatedly invoked the climate crisis and the energy transition, arguing that the only successful and sustainable global transition would be one where green technologies were not monopolized by a single country. US officials were well aware that monopolization was something that China was close to actually achieving. By 2023, China controlled the production of around 90 percent of the world’s rare-earth elements used in clean-energy products and at least 80 percent of the global solar-panel supply chain, with only slightly lower shares in wind turbines and EV batteries. Washington also looked with something like awe at China’s build-out of solar and wind power: The year after Biden’s historic “climate bill,” the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, was passed to great domestic fanfare, China installed 10 times as much net new renewable capacity as America did. Under Trump 2.0, all emphasis on green technology has of course been buried (at least rhetorically, since the tariffs on China’s green tech were retained). But the tariff saber-rattling has nonetheless escalated into all-out trade warfare. In February, a 10 percent tariff was imposed on Chinese imports across the board, and in March, this was increased to 20 percent. Trump was just getting started, however: April 2, his “Liberation Day,” saw the blanket tariff rate on China raised to 54 percent; and at the time of this writing, after retaliatory Chinese measures, the US tariff rate on Chinese imports effectively totals 145 percent. What is increasingly clear is that after decades of cautious sparring, the rivalry between America and China—as the US regards it, at any rate—has become a battle for global economic supremacy. Certainly, the Trump administration has targeted many other countries too, but China is plainly the main antagonist. Not for nothing has the Chinese government accused the United States of “unilateral bullying.” What is also clear, though, is that underneath America’s bluster lurks a very real and very understandable fear: namely, that this is a battle that America might not win. In fact, more than that, this is a battle that America might have already lost; all the joking on social media that the United States has entered its own “Century of Humiliation”— China’s lasted from the mid-19th to the mid-20th century—cuts to the quick precisely because it expresses very real anxieties. If one company symbolizes the ongoing struggle between America and China, that company, arguably, is Huawei. In its early years, after it was founded in 1987, Huawei—a Chinese tech firm that focuses on telecommunications—was largely ignored in the US, to the extent that it was even acknowledged. In the 2000s and early 2010s, as the company grew and expanded, including in the United States itself, American business and policy elites generally tolerated Huawei, perceiving it, at worst, as an irritant. But since Trump’s first term as president, a new era has begun. Endlessly challenged and vitriolically attacked, Huawei has ascended to the status of Public Enemy No. 1, the very apotheosis of the Chinese “threat.” So why is Huawei treated with such hostility by US policymakers? Partly it’s about geopolitics. Though Huawei is an increasingly diversified enterprise, its main business, generating over half of total revenue, is the design, manufacture, and sale of telecom equipment such as networking infrastructure and the provision of ancillary services. Communications networks, of course, are integral to the ways in which states eavesdrop and spy on one another. America’s fear is that Huawei could or already does allow its products to be used to nefarious ends by the Chinese government. Ergo, it is deemed a threat to US national security. It is with this aspect of Huawei’s role in US-China relations that Eva Dou, a reporter for The Washington Post, is principally concerned in her new book, House of Huawei: The Secret History of China’s Most Powerful Company. It has never been a secret that Huawei’s technologies are widely embedded in the contemporary surveillance state. The company has, for instance, been a major player since the 2000s in the international market for the chips used in surveillance cameras; Huawei was one of eight companies selected by Beijing in 1996 for a $1 billion national semiconductor development program. In China itself, what proved an especially lucrative opportunity for Huawei was President Xi Jinping’s launch in 2015 of a program—dubbed “Sharp Eyes”—aimed, Dou writes, at “blanketing the country with a network of security cameras.” In 2020, it was announced that China’s capital had no more blind spots: “Electronic eyes were watching over 100 percent of Beijing.” The same year, the Post revealed that Huawei had knowingly countenanced the use of its technology to track members of the Uyghur ethnic minority, prompting the French soccer star Antoine Griezmann to terminate his sponsorship deal with the company. While the Uyghur revelations certainly hardened what by that point was a growing US-led international turn against Huawei, policymakers in America and other Western markets have always been much more concerned about the security-related and political implications of Huawei’s presence in their own territories. Could Huawei’s gear be hacked, leading to network disruption? Could the Chinese government listen in on international network users? From the American perspective, the biographic details of Huawei’s legendary founder and CEO, Ren Zhengfei—a background in the military (the Engineering Corps) and a member of the Chinese Communist Party since 1978—only redoubled the grounds for suspicion. “With Huawei increasingly integrated into global networks,” Dou writes of developments in the mid-2000s, “it was being watched closely by spy agencies.” Statements along these lines pepper the book; by the end, the reader may wonder why Dou spends quite so much time on the cloak-and-dagger stuff, given that she never does unearth a smoking gun of any kind. Nonetheless, she is quite right to highlight the staggering hypocrisy of the US government’s moral grandstanding about alleged Chinese espionage machinations. As the 2013–14 Snowden leaks demonstrated, America’s own National Security Agency had successfully infiltrated Huawei several years previously and was using its infrastructure to spy not just on the company but on a range of other public- and private-sector entities, both in China and around the world. “The irony,” as Huawei’s US spokesman, William Plummer, put it at the time, “is that exactly what they are doing to us is what they have always charged that the Chinese are doing through us.” No wonder, remarks Dou, that Washington had been “so confident that Beijing could use Huawei’s gear for snooping: the NSA had been doing exactly that for years.” For all the security concerns, however, the fact that Huawei is regarded as such a threat has to do with much more than “just” geopolitics. Equally important, and perhaps even more so, is the brute fact of Huawei’s staggering commercial success. One suspects that, consciously or otherwise, anxiety about Huawei’s competitive accomplishments is sometimes dressed up as a concern with “safety”: Far easier for the American mind to invoke a surveillance bogeyman than to admit to trepidatious reverence at Chinese business prowess. As late as the turn of the millennium, the international telecommunications hardware market—Huawei’s home turf—continued to be dominated by Western firms such as Alcatel, Ericsson, Lucent, and Nortel. But the first decade of the new millennium began to see a changing of the guard. A seminal moment, as Dou tells it, came with Huawei’s first major breakthrough in the West, when, in 2005, the company won a lucrative bid to upgrade the network of BT, Britain’s largest supplier of telephony services. Opening the door to, among others, the French and Spanish markets, the BT deal was the “beginning of the end for several of Huawei’s Western rivals,” who simply couldn’t compete with the company at its “budget price points.” By 2012, Huawei was the world’s largest vendor of telecommunications networking hardware. Having also successfully made the move into consumer electronics—branded household gadgets “could help Huawei soften its image overseas,” Dou notes—the Chinese firm was, for good measure, now the world’s third-largest smartphone maker, behind only Apple and Samsung. Elie Mystal Elie Mystal Books & the Arts / Brett Christophers Chris Lehmann Huawei has succeeded internationally despite America’s best efforts, especially in the past decade, to prevent it from doing so. The company had been on Washington’s radar since the late 1990s, not least because of its expansion in those years into markets presided over by what the US deemed “rogue” regimes, among them Iraq and Russia. The result was that, even after Huawei successfully made big sales in other Western territories after establishing its foothold in Britain, America would remain the one major market in which it failed to make significant inroads, having to satisfy itself there with sales to second- or third-tier network operators. As a potential supplier, the Chinese company was simply beyond the pale for America’s telephony market leaders, for whom political optics and relationships are considered just as important as capital costs and network quality. During the first Trump administration, the US expanded its campaign against Huawei on two new fronts. It imposed export controls, specifically by banning US companies from supplying Huawei with critical components, as they had been doing since as early as 1993, when Huawei established its first US subsidiary in California. And, with some notable successes, the US government also began applying substantial pressure on countries like Australia, Britain, and Canada to follow its lead in blackballing Huawei in their domestic markets, focusing on those countries’ tendering of contracts to build 5G networks. Huawei, however, has prevailed nonetheless, even as there is no doubt that America’s resistance has crimped the scope of its achievements. “The West was continuing to grow more inhospitable toward Huawei,” Dou says by way of bringing her story up to the time of her writing, in 2024. “Yet—almost incredibly—Huawei was still number one in the world in 5G gear sales.” Huawei’s prevailing in the face of the United States’ concerted opposition shows that America is not as powerful or persuasive as it certainly likes to imagine that it is: Not everyone, even its (erstwhile) “friends,” kowtows to its demands. Furthermore, and perhaps more significantly still, the Huawei story demonstrates that in the 21st century, non-Western companies are able to be enormous commercial successes—to be, in fact, world leaders in their chosen industry sectors—while having the US and several other leading Western markets essentially closed off to them. That, in itself, is a profound statement on the shifting of the world economic order, and one that Trump and his cronies evidently seem to be ignoring—or perhaps are unable to understand—as they set about alienating long-time commercial and political allies, in addition to the list of long-time adversaries, by unleashing an all-encompassing trade war the likes of which the world has not seen since the early 20th century. In the postwar era, it would have been unthinkable that a company could have ascended to global market leadership in any area of the economy without a major presence in the United States, Europe, or (more likely) both. That is no longer true. Alongside East Asia and Africa, it is the Middle East, with all its natural-resource-based riches, that represents, in Dou’s words, “the beating heart of Huawei’s global empire.” What is also maddening to Huawei’s American critics is that it has done all this while thumbing its nose at American-style capitalism. For many years, there was widespread expectation around the world, and among many in China itself, that Huawei would proceed to an IPO. This was assumed to be its “natural” evolutionary terminus, the inevitable result of the company’s inculcating, and eventually adopting, the Western gospel of shareholder value. But Huawei never did become a public company, and it never prioritized shareholder value to the exclusion of all else. It was, and is, something else entirely—and that something else has proved a great commercial success. What do we know about the model? Huawei began life as a contract manufacturer. That is, at the start, it did not have its own products, but manufactured those of others—including, most notably, simple analog telephone switches capable of routing and connecting, at most, a few dozen phone calls, which were sold to the likes of small offices and hotels. Huawei was initially a private company, controlled top to bottom by Ren Zhengfei himself and capitalized with the princely sum of 21,000 yuan provided by Ren and five private investors. Five years after its founding, by which time it had developed and begun to sell a first switch of its own (the BH-03), Huawei converted in 1992 to a “collectively owned enterprise,” a company structure that furnished both a degree of political patronage and a set of broader financing opportunities—and which, in Huawei’s case, appeared to entail a more democratic form of management in the shape, in particular, of a powerful workers’ committee. A stimulus for further change came in 1994, a landmark year for China’s corporate landscape, when the country’s new Company Law introduced limited-liability companies (LLCs) with the aims of encouraging greater investment, aligning China’s corporate governance with international standards, and facilitating an accelerated transition to a market economy. Ren was intrigued but not immediately convinced, electing to hire a team of Beijing business professors to help him strategize restructuring opportunities and map out a new future for the firm. Huawei did become an LLC (and remains one today), but only in 1997, at which point the existing employee shareholdings, of which there were a large number, were consolidated into a single “trade union” holding. Meanwhile, the professors’ much-anticipated blueprint, the “Huawei Basic Law,” was adopted the following year. Profit would be just one objective among many; more important was the reinvestment of that profit to drive growth—fully 10 percent of sales were to go into R&D. Dou argues that Huawei is ultimately best understood as a company made in the image of the nation. Its goal is not to increase shareholder value so much as “to ensure its own long-term survival,” as is also true, she points out, of the ruling Communist Party. The secret of Huawei’s success, Dou writes, is its “ability to accomplish titanic tasks at almost impossible speeds by getting everyone to pull in unison.” Reading these words, one can’t help but think, yet again, of China’s titanic ongoing achievements in rolling out renewable energy capacity on a gargantuan scale and at almost impossible speeds. But Dou is also forthright about the considerable downsides of this business approach. Success achieved in the manner of Huawei, she observes, “can come at crushing costs for the individuals involved.” Huawei “fetishized long work hours”—the company’s engineers were accustomed to keeping mats by their desks so they could nap on the floor rather than going home at night. Perhaps worse was that an aggressive, survival-of-the-fittest “wolf culture” was encouraged not just externally, in the rivalry with competitors, but internally, among colleagues. And it surely did not help employees’ mental health to know that the prospect of involuntary redundancy constantly hovered in the background: Huawei, Dou notes, “repeatedly pressured its staff into mass resignations.” In any case, enough is known about the psychological effects to leave the reader in no doubt about the sheer corrosiveness of the Huawei model from a social perspective. Dou reports a “string of ‘unnatural’ deaths,” including suicides, among employees. She also cites the finding of a scholarly study that some two-thirds of Huawei’s senior management were suffering from a stress-related illness. Such figures hint at a milieu beside which even Wall Street’s famously pitiless working culture would likely look positively tranquil. Huawei is a creature of Shenzhen, a city in the coastal province of Guangdong in South China. After the decommissioning of his military unit, the Engineering Corps, a thirtysomething Ren Zhengfei moved to Shenzhen in the early 1980s, initially assigned a job there at a subsidiary of the state-owned South Sea Oil Corporation, which was building a harbor to support offshore oil production. Following a “short and undistinguished” time in this position, Ren—who had made something of a name for himself in the military by building a precision air-pressure generator that he subsequently worked to commercialize—established Huawei. He was 42. He is still the company’s CEO today. It is possible, perhaps even probable, that Huawei could not have become what it did except in Shenzhen. Abutting Hong Kong to its immediate south, Shenzhen was designated as China’s first-ever “special economic zone” in 1980. At the time, it had a population of around 30,000. Physically walled off from the rest of China by barbed-wire fences, it was also walled off figuratively: While the post-Mao reformism of Deng Xiaoping initially proceeded slowly in the country at large, everything was on fast forward in the “wild west” that was late-20th-century Shenzhen, where the normal rules did not apply and an “anything goes” approach prevailed. The city was “ground zero,” Dou writes, for China’s “grand experiment with capitalism.” Ren and Huawei exploited this business environment maximally, as did many others. In the 1980s through the 2010s, Shenzhen was one of the fastest-growing cities in the world: By 2020, its 30,000 inhabitants had become 17.4 million, making the city by then China’s third-largest. Of course, the Chinese “capitalism” with which Ren and others experimented in booming Shenzhen was and is a very special version, and Dou does a wonderful job of picturing its sheer foreignness and oddness, when seen through Western eyes. In no respect, perhaps, is the foreignness of Chinese capitalism more striking than in terms of the relation between firms and the Chinese Communist Party. All companies with a certain proportion of employees who are party members are required to establish an internal party “committee” that gives the CCP a formal role in the company. Huawei set up its committee in 1996, with Ren himself serving as the first secretary. Huawei’s committee infused the company with the CCP’s signature themes of “patriotism, struggle for the greater cause, and self-sacrifice”—no doubt the mats by the engineers’ desks and the surging mental health problems were justified accordingly—and its influence appears only to have grown with time. In 2007, the committee was granted veto power over Huawei’s executive appointments. Indeed, as Western observers have never tired of remarking, Huawei’s fortunes were bound up with the party, and with the state more generally, from the start. The mistake that those observers have made, however, is to think about the Chinese state primarily, and sometimes only, in terms of Beijing, which is to say the central government. To do so, Dou shows us, is to miss one of the most important parts of the Huawei story. The specific products that were key to making Huawei a major commercial force both nationally and internationally were digital telephone switches. Able to route and connect thousands (or even millions) of calls at once compared with the mere dozens handled by analog versions, digital switches constitute the nerve centers of modern public communications networks, directing and managing the flow of data as well as voice packets. When Huawei began working in the early 1990s on the development of digital switches, that work was financed by a joint-venture company called Mobeco, established in 1993. The money behind Mobeco was provided by Huawei’s equity partners in the venture—namely, 17 provincial and municipal (that is, public) telecom bureaus. When Huawei’s first proprietary digital switch (C&C08) went into production in 1995, the same public telecom bureaus that had helped finance its development were now in charge of buying it for their local telephone exchanges. Not only that, but, indirectly at least, they also found themselves manufacturing it: Huawei outsourced the production of C&C08 to Mobeco. In short, what Western observers might understand as conflicts of interest abounded. And Huawei then doubled down, as the success of Mobeco prompted it to expand the model: It set up more such joint ventures with local governments around the country. Dou characterizes these as “Huawei’s ‘marriage’ to the state.” This is not to say that Huawei didn’t have close and efficacious relationships with other arms of the state—for example, “in 2005,” Dou writes, “the China Development Bank, a Beijing-controlled policy bank, allocated a whopping $10 billion to fund Huawei’s overseas expansion.” Despite documenting these various linkages between the company and the state, this is also, paradoxically, where House of Huawei is at its weakest. As Dou observes, amid the 1990s ferment of productive innovation in China, Huawei was one of four major domestic producers of telecom equipment to come to the fore, the others being Datang, Great Dragon, and ZTE. Why, out of these four, did Huawei emerge as the undisputed leader both domestically and, ultimately, internationally? Dou doesn’t—and arguably can’t—answer that question, because despite hinting that Huawei won simply by virtue of outcompeting its rivals, she never actually gets at the question of what “competition” means in the context of Chinese capitalism, saturated as that system is in political influence. Scholars, however, have been exploring this question. The sociologist Kyle Chan, for instance, has examined the nature of competition in sectors of the Chinese economy in which state-owned enterprises (SOEs) play a significant role. His research is highly relevant to the case at hand: Datang, Great Dragon, and ZTE are all owned wholly or mainly by the state. Chan found that industries with a substantial SOE presence, telecommunications included, are characterized by what he calls “managed competition,” representing a blend of state oversight and competitive forces and combining innovation and efficiency, on the one hand, with control and planning on the other. In order to maintain a balance of competitive capabilities among industry actors and thus prevent the formation of monopolies, the state intervenes where necessary, Chan argues, to redistribute resources, personnel, and contracts. There is very little analysis of this kind in House of Huawei. Dou has written a book that is much more interested in personalities, subterfuge, and geopolitics than it is in economics and competitive practice. She helps us understand why Huawei vaulted to the top of US policymakers’ fearful protectionist agenda, but less about how and why it vaulted to the top of the telecommunications industry against both national and international competitors. We are left with much still to understand about Huawei as a particular corporate embodiment of what is, in the Chinese case, a very particular type of capitalist social formation. The chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week. Trump’s catastrophic “Liberation Day” has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called “enemy aliens” are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire. At a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump’s intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account. In just the last month, we’ve published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration’s appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities. We also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections—like Wisconsin’s recent state Supreme Court race—that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can’t buy our democracy.

April 21, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, April 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP), Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVI), e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE: ELF), and Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ:MANH). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) Class Period: May 10, 2023 – March 26, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 The AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period created the false impression that AppLovin’s enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform, in addition to its “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. In truth, AppLovin was exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices that forced unwanted apps on customers via a “backdoor installation scheme” which inaccurately inflated installation numbers, and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. The AppLovin class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 26, 2025, analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. On this news, the price of AppLovin shares fell by more than 12%, the AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges.

(NASDAQ: MRVI) Class Period: August 7, 2024 - February 24, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 On February 25, 2025, before the market opened, Maravai announced it was postponing its fiscal 2024 earnings release and would delay filing its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. The Company had identified an error in revenue recognition that “resulted in approximately $3.9 million in revenue being recorded in the final week of the second quarter of 2024 upon shipment when it should have been recorded in the first week of the third quarter of 2024 upon receipt by the customer.” The Company had identified “a material weakness in its internal controls over revenue recognition.” Maravai also required additional time to “complete its assessment of a potential non-cash impairment charge related to goodwill associated with its previous acquisition of Alphazyme LLC.” On this news, the Company’s share price fell $0.87, or 21.70%, to close at $3.14 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Maravai lacked adequate internal controls over financial reporting related to revenue recognition; (2) as a result, the Company inaccurately recognized revenue on certain transactions during fiscal 2024; (3) its goodwill was overstated; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

(NYSE: ELF) Class Period: November 1, 2023 - November 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. To maintain investor confidence, e.l.f. Beauty inflated revenue and other financial measures over multiple quarters. The Company suffered from rising inventory levels. The Company falsely attributed its rising inventory to changes in sourcing. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period.

(NASDAQ:MANH) Class Period: July 24, 2024 – February 7, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2025 The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants provided investors with material information concerning Manhattan Associates' expected revenue for the fiscal year 2025. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Defendants' statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company's ability to forecast guidance despite macroeconomic fluctuations, the growth potential of their professional services offerings, and the ability for their cloud revenue to drive revenue for its professional services. On January 28, 2025, Manhattan Associates issued a press release reporting its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. Among other items, the Company disclosed services revenue of $119.5 million for the quarter, growing by only 0.3% compared to the year-ago quarter and falling approximately $2 million short of the guidance provided in October 2024. Manhattan Associates attributed the results to delays in professional services work and deferred deals, predicting that the Company's services revenue would reach a low point in the first quarter of 2025 and that solid revenue growth would not resume until mid-year. Manhattan Associates further revealed emerging challenges in its services business, noting that around 10% of customers with ongoing implementations had scaled back their planned services work for the upcoming calendar and fiscal year. The Company also announced that its 2025 revenues would see modest growth of just 2% to 3%, while GAAP EPS was expected to decline by 10% to 13%.

Title: What’s the current news with all of the magnificent seven stocks

Time Published: 2025-04-21T21:15:31Z
Full Content:
Key Points Why the Magnificent Seven’s Performance is Significant Market Influence and Economic Indicators The Magnificent Seven stocks are pivotal to global financial markets due to their massive market capitalizations and heavy weighting in major indices like the S&P 500, where they accounted for 32% of the index’s value as of March 2025. Their performance often dictates broader market trends, as seen in the April 3, 2025, sell-off, when their $1 trillion collective market cap loss contributed to a nearly 5% drop in the S&P 500 and a 6% decline in the Nasdaq [CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion]. This event highlights their role as bellwethers for investor confidence and economic health. Their recovery following the April 8 tariff pause, with the S&P 500 rising 9.5%, further demonstrates their ability to drive market rebounds [The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs]. Their significance extends beyond the U.S., as they contributed 39.8% to the MSCI ACWI Index’s total return in 2023, reflecting their global influence [Mellon Investments Corporation: A Closer Look at Magnificent Seven Stocks]. A downturn or recovery in these stocks can signal shifts in global investment flows, particularly in technology and innovation-driven sectors. Sensitivity to Policy and Trade Dynamics The recent volatility in these stocks, driven by President Trump’s tariff announcements and subsequent pause, underscores their sensitivity to geopolitical and economic policy changes. The April 3 tariff announcement, imposing duties like 26% on India and 34% on China, raised concerns about supply chain disruptions and inflation, particularly for tech companies with global operations [Reuters: Instant view: Hefty Trump tariffs surprise markets, stocks slide]. For instance, Amazon, which relies on Chinese imports for 25% of first-party and 70% of third-party goods, faced potential cost increases, contributing to its 20% year-to-date decline by April 20, 2025 [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58]. The tariff pause on April 8 mitigated some of these pressures, but the event highlights how policy shifts can ripple through these stocks, affecting investor portfolios and market stability. This is particularly relevant given your interest in Amazon’s stock decline due to tariffs and Bitcoin’s rise [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58; April 21, 2025, 13:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s performance provides context for understanding why assets like Bitcoin may gain traction when traditional equities falter, as investors seek alternatives amid uncertainty. Investor Sentiment and Market Rotation The Magnificent Seven’s worst Q1 on record, with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF down over 15%, reflects a broader market rotation away from tech-heavy investments [Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record]. Stocks like Tesla (down 35%) and Nvidia (down 20%) faced significant declines, driven by company-specific challenges (e.g., Tesla’s slowing sales) and competitive pressures (e.g., Nvidia vs. Chinese AI startups) [Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record]. This rotation suggests investors are diversifying into other sectors, which could reshape market dynamics in 2025. Your interest in Bitcoin’s rise, potentially as a hedge against traditional market volatility, aligns with this trend [Conversation Memory: April 21, 2025, 13:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s struggles may be pushing capital toward cryptocurrencies, as seen in the $60 billion added to the crypto market while $1.5 trillion was deleted from U.S. stocks [CoinMarketCap: Bitcoin Price Analysis]. Their performance thus serves as a barometer for shifts in investor risk appetite. Long-Term Implications for Innovation and Earnings Despite recent challenges, the Magnificent Seven remain leaders in innovation, with significant resources to weather volatility [Fidelity: What are the Magnificent 7 stocks?]. However, their expected earnings contribution to the S&P 500 is projected to fall to 33% in 2025 from 75% in 2024, indicating a potential slowdown in their dominance [Investopedia: What To Expect from the Magnificent Seven in 2025]. This shift could impact investor expectations and valuations, particularly for stocks like Apple and Microsoft, which have historically driven tech growth. Your curiosity about financial strategies, such as Eric Kim’s Bitcoin-focused investing style, suggests an interest in navigating such market shifts [Conversation Memory: April 18, 2025, 17:01; April 20, 2025, 16:55]. The Magnificent Seven’s performance is significant because it highlights the risks and opportunities in tech-heavy portfolios, potentially reinforcing the appeal of alternative assets like Bitcoin for diversification. Connection to Your Interests Your prior conversations about Amazon’s tariff-driven decline, Bitcoin’s rise, and MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin exposure indicate a focus on how macroeconomic events and investment choices intersect [Conversation Memory: April 20, 2025, 16:58; April 21, 2025, 13:53; April 20, 2025, 16:53]. The Magnificent Seven’s volatility is significant in this context because it: Critical Perspective While the establishment narrative emphasizes the Magnificent Seven’s market dominance and policy-driven volatility, it’s worth questioning whether their influence is overstated. Their significant weighting in indices may amplify their perceived impact, but smaller sectors or assets (e.g., Bitcoin) can also drive meaningful market shifts, as seen in recent crypto gains. Additionally, the rapid recovery post-tariff pause suggests markets may be overreacting to policy announcements, potentially driven by speculative trading rather than fundamental changes. This volatility could benefit agile investors, like those following philosophies you’ve explored, who capitalize on uncertainty rather than relying on tech giants’ stability. Summary Table: Why the Magnificent Seven’s Performance Matters Key Citations Key Points Background The Magnificent Seven stocks are leading tech companies known for driving market performance, but recent events have introduced uncertainty. These include Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla. Recent Events On April 3, 2025, President Trump’s tariff announcement caused a sharp market decline, impacting these stocks significantly. The S&P 500 fell nearly 5%, and the Nasdaq dropped about 6%, with the Magnificent Seven losing over $1 trillion in market cap CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion. On April 8, a 90-day tariff pause led to a market rebound, with the S&P 500 rising 9.5% The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs. Performance Context In Q1 2025, these stocks had their worst quarter on record, with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF down over 15%, and individual stocks like Tesla (down 35%) and Nvidia (down 20%) seeing significant drops Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record. Specific data for April 8-21, 2025, is not available, but markets likely stabilized post-pause. Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Magnificent Seven Stocks in April 2025 This section provides a comprehensive examination of the recent performance and news surrounding the Magnificent Seven stocks—Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla—as of April 21, 2025, drawing from multiple reliable sources to ensure a thorough understanding. The analysis is structured to cover market events, individual stock performance, and broader economic contexts, offering a detailed perspective for readers seeking depth beyond the initial summary. Market Events and Tariff Impact The Magnificent Seven stocks, known for their significant influence on market indices like the S&P 500 (accounting for 32% as of March 2025), faced heightened volatility in early April 2025 due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. On April 3, 2025, Trump announced sweeping reciprocal tariffs, matching duties imposed on U.S. goods by other countries, including 26% on India, 24% on Japan, and 34% on China Reuters: Instant view: Hefty Trump tariffs surprise markets, stocks slide. This announcement triggered a broad market sell-off, with the S&P 500 nosediving almost 5% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq ending down about 6%, marking one of the worst days since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 CNBC: Trump tariffs live updates: Markets plunge amid layoffs, price hikes. According to CNBC: Magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion as tech drives stock market nosedive, the Magnificent Seven stocks collectively lost more than $1 trillion in market capitalization on that day, reflecting their heavy weighting in tech indices. The market reaction was driven by fears of trade wars, potential recession, and inflation spikes, with economists warning that core inflation could run north of 3% and economic growth might be flat or negative Reuters: Trump tariffs slam markets, stunned investors brace for slow growth, retaliation. This uncertainty particularly impacted tech stocks, given their global supply chains and reliance on international markets. However, on April 8, 2025, Trump announced a 90-day pause on many of these tariffs, which led to a significant market recovery. The S&P 500 rose 9.5%, with markets reacting positively to the temporary relief The New York Times: Markets Soar After Trump Backs Down on Tariffs. This pause, effective as of April 21, 2025, has likely contributed to market stabilization, though the long-term impact remains uncertain. Q1 2025 Performance and Early Year Challenges Before the April tariff events, the Magnificent Seven stocks had already faced a challenging start to 2025. According to Investopedia: Why the Magnificent Seven Stocks Just Had Their Worst Month and Quarter on Record, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), composed of Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla, lost about 10.5% of its value in March 2025, marking its worst month since its launch in April 2023. For the first quarter, the ETF was down more than 15%, reflecting broader weakness in big tech stocks. Individual stock performances varied significantly: These declines were part of a broader market rotation, with investors shifting capital away from over-concentrated tech stocks into other opportunities, as noted by Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, in The Financial Express: Magnificent Seven stocks face a downturn in 2025: What’s next for big tech?. Post-Tariff Pause Performance (April 8-21, 2025) Specific performance data for the Magnificent Seven stocks between April 8 and April 21, 2025, is not readily available from the sources, but market trends suggest a likely recovery following the tariff pause. Given their significant weighting in the S&P 500 and the index’s 9.5% rise on April 8, it is reasonable to infer that these stocks benefited from the rebound. However, the exact extent of recovery for each stock remains unclear without real-time data. Fidelity: What are the Magnificent 7 stocks? mentions high volatility in early 2025, with historical data showing strong long-term returns but recent challenges. The article, dated April 18, 2025, notes that these stocks have historically had ample operating resources and market leadership, but early 2025 volatility aligns with the tariff-related events. Broader Economic and Market Context The Magnificent Seven’s performance must be viewed in the context of broader market dynamics. Their combined market capitalization makes up nearly one-third of the S&P 500’s value, and their influence extends globally, contributing 39.8% to the total return of the MSCI ACWI Index in 2023 Mellon Investments Corporation: A Closer Look at Magnificent Seven Stocks. However, 2025 has seen a shift, with expected earnings growth contracting to 33% of S&P 500 gains, down from 75% in 2024, as per Investopedia: What To Expect from the Magnificent Seven in 2025. Economic factors, such as potential Federal Reserve rate cuts and global trade tensions, continue to influence investor sentiment. The tariff pause provides temporary relief, but concerns about inflation, recession risks, and regulatory changes remain, particularly for tech giants with global operations. Summary Table: Key Factors and Details Below is a table summarizing the key factors contributing to the Magnificent Seven stocks’ performance in April 2025, with supporting details and sources: This detailed analysis ensures a comprehensive understanding of the Magnificent Seven stocks’ performance in April 2025, addressing market events, individual stock trends, and broader economic factors, while acknowledging the complexity and volatility inherent in these high-profile investments.

The Biology Behind Weight Loss Plateaus Ever feel like your body hits the brakes on fat burning—right when you’re finally making progress? That’s not just bad luck. It’s biology. When you first start losing weight, your body burns through stored fat fast. But soon, it starts to adapt. Your metabolism slows down. Hormones shift. Your body thinks it’s in danger of losing too much, too fast—so it holds on to fat. This is called a weight loss plateau, and it’s totally normal. But here’s the good news: with the right support (like natural fat-burners, better gut health, and inflammation control), you can restart your fat-burning engine. That’s where smarter solutions like Lipozem come in—designed to help your body unlock stubborn fat and keep moving forward. Is Modern Life Making Us Fatter? The Real 2025 Weight Gain Story Let’s be honest—losing weight in 2025 feels harder than ever. Despite calorie counting, gym memberships, and trendy diets, millions still struggle with stubborn fat that refuses to budge. So, what’s going on? Experts now point to our modern lifestyle as the silent culprit. Ultra-processed food, chronic stress, poor sleep, and non-stop screen time all create the perfect storm. These daily habits quietly inflame our fat cells, slow down metabolism, and trigger hormone chaos—causing our bodies to cling to every pound. In this eye-opening breakdown, we’ll explore how today’s world is working against our waistlines—and why inflammation is the missing link behind stalled progress. Plus, we’ll reveal how smart solutions like Lipozem are shifting the game by targeting the root cause, not just the symptoms. What Is Lipozem — and Can It Actually Help You Lose Weight? Tired of trying every fad diet, pill, or workout routine only to see minimal results? You’re not alone. In 2025, weight loss has become more challenging than ever, with stress, hormonal imbalances, and poor lifestyle habits working against us at every turn. Many people find themselves stuck in a frustrating cycle where nothing seems to work. Enter Lipozem—the breakthrough Triple-BHB fat burner that’s making waves in the world of weight loss supplements. Unlike the typical fat burners that rely on harsh stimulants and short-term fixes, Lipozem focuses on a much deeper issue: inflammation in your fat cells. When fat cells become inflamed, they’re “locked,” making it incredibly hard for your body to burn stored fat, no matter how much you exercise or cut calories. That’s where Lipozem comes in. It’s designed to target this inflammation, allowing your body to start burning fat more efficiently while also offering increased energy, reduced cravings, and improved digestion. But the big question remains: Does it really work?

The Science Behind the Supplement: Lipozem’s Core Ingredients That Target Stubborn Fat When it comes to weight loss, it's not just about what you cut out, but what you put in. Lipozem’s formula is designed to optimize fat loss and overall well-being by focusing on inflammation and metabolic health—and the ingredients back up its claims. Let’s dive into the core ingredients that make this supplement stand out in 2025. Triple-BHB Blend (Beta-Hydroxybutyrate) What It Does:BHB (Beta-Hydroxybutyrate) is the MVP of Lipozem’s formula, but this isn’t just a single compound. It’s a Triple-BHB blend, meaning you get three different forms of BHB (Calcium, Magnesium, and Sodium) to support fat burning in multiple ways. Turmeric Extract (Curcumin) What It Does:Turmeric is not only a kitchen staple but a powerhouse for reducing inflammation in the body. Specifically, it contains curcumin, which has been shown in studies to combat chronic inflammation, a key contributor to stubborn weight. Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) What It Does:Apple cider vinegar is a beloved ingredient in natural wellness, and for good reason. It’s included in Lipozem for its fat-burning, blood sugar-regulating, and digestive-supporting properties. Garcinia Cambogia (Hydroxycitric Acid - HCA) What It Does:Known for its potent HCA (Hydroxycitric Acid), Garcinia Cambogia has been used for centuries in traditional medicine. It’s included in Lipozem for its ability to support appetite control and mood regulation. Green Tea Extract (EGCG) What It Does:Green tea extract is packed with antioxidants, specifically catechins like EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate), which are known for their metabolism-boosting properties. MCT Oil (Medium-Chain Triglycerides) What It Does:Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are a special type of fat that is metabolized quickly by the body, providing a quick energy source without being stored as fat. Bioperine (Black Pepper Extract) What It Does:Bioperine is a potent bioavailability enhancer that increases the absorption of all the ingredients in Lipozem, making them more effective. Lipozem's Synergy: How All Ingredients Work Together Lipozem doesn’t just throw a bunch of ingredients together and hope for the best. It’s the synergy of the Triple-BHB, Turmeric, Apple Cider Vinegar, Garcinia Cambogia, and others that create a powerful, multi-pathway solution for burning fat. By targeting inflammation, metabolic function, and fat storage, Lipozem works to ignite your body’s natural fat-burning capabilities—without harsh stimulants or extreme dieting. In summary, Lipozem’s ingredients are more than just popular buzzwords—they’re scientifically-backed components that work together to create a system that targets fat from the inside out, boosts your metabolism, and helps you finally get over those weight loss plateaus. The Truth Behind the Triple-BHB Formula Lipozem’s fat-burning engine finally decoded By now, you’ve probably seen the term Triple-BHB all over Lipozem reviews and wondered—what’s the big deal? Is it just another buzzword? Spoiler: nope. It’s the real metabolic magic behind Lipozem’s 2025 weight loss momentum. Let’s break it down without the science snooze-fest: BHB (Beta-Hydroxybutyrate) is a ketone your body produces when it's burning fat for fuel. But here’s the kicker—Lipozem doesn’t just give you one type of BHB… it delivers a triple hit. That’s sodium BHB, magnesium BHB, and calcium BHB working in perfect harmony to supercharge fat loss and help unlock the stubborn stuff (yes, even belly fat). What Makes Triple-BHB in Lipozem a Game-Changer? According to Dr. Julian Ross, the formulator behind Lipozem, this Triple-BHB blend isn’t about gimmicks—it’s about restoring balance in bodies overwhelmed by inflammation, stress, and sugar crashes. It’s inflammation-first, fat-burning second, and stimulant-free always. So, is Lipozem legit?

Driven by gut-focused research, Lipozem reboots metabolism at its core Driven by gut-focused research, Lipozem is flipping the script on fat loss by rebooting metabolism at its core. Unlike typical weight loss pills that rely on harsh stimulants or one-size-fits-all formulas, Lipozem uses a smart, science-backed approach rooted in inflammation control and digestive health. The key players? A Triple-BHB ketone blend for clean energy and fat-burning support, plus powerhouse ingredients like turmeric curcumin and spirulina that help calm inflamed fat cells and restore metabolic function.

Just a clean, targeted formula focused on healing from within—because true weight loss starts in the gut. The Clinical Evidence: What the Research Shows While many supplements rely on animal studies or theoretical benefits, Lipozem stands out with solid clinical trials conducted on humans. Most of the research was performed in Italy, with the key study being a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial involving 248 participants with confirmed gut dysbiosis. The results, published in the Journal of Digestive Health Research, were nothing short of impressive: "What stands out in this study is that the benefits go far beyond just digestive health," says an expert in integrative gastroenterology.

Experts explain the weight loss mechanisms as follows: “It appears to be driven by a combination of factors, including better nutrient absorption, reduced inflammation, improved metabolic function, and the restoration of gut bacteria that play key roles in regulating appetite and fat storage. >>>Get Lipozem Today for a Healthier Tomorrow—Click for Special Deals and Pricing!

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Is Lipozem safe to take every day?Yes—absolutely. Lipozem is made with clean, well-researched ingredients like BHB salts, turmeric curcumin, and spirulina, all of which are considered safe when taken as directed. It contains no synthetic stimulants, no sketchy chemicals, and no hidden fillers. That said, if you're pregnant, nursing, or managing any serious health conditions, it's always smart to talk to your healthcare provider before adding any supplement to your daily routine. How soon will I see results with Lipozem?Everyone’s timeline is a bit different, but many users report subtle shifts within the first 1–2 weeks—like fewer cravings, more steady energy, or feeling less bloated. Visible fat loss tends to show up around weeks 3–4 and can continue improving over 8–12 weeks with consistent use. Because Lipozem focuses on reducing inflammation first (not just water weight), the results are more sustainable—but you’ll need a little patience. Does Lipozem have caffeine or cause jitters?Nope! Lipozem is 100% stimulant-free. That means no caffeine, no energy spikes, and definitely no crash later. Instead, it uses exogenous BHB ketones and anti-inflammatory botanicals to give you that calm, steady energy without the “wired” feeling so common in thermogenic fat burners. Can I take it with other supplements or meds?In most cases, yes. Lipozem plays well with others—but if you’re taking prescription medications (especially for blood sugar, thyroid, or hormones), it’s wise to consult your doctor. Since the formula influences metabolism and inflammation, it’s best to be cautious if you have underlying conditions. What if I forget to take it one day?No big deal—just pick back up with your next dose. While Lipozem works best when used daily, you don’t need to panic if you miss a serving. Just try to stay consistent over time for the best results. Is Lipozem for both men and women?Definitely. Weight gain related to inflammation doesn’t discriminate. Whether it’s stubborn belly fat in men or hormonal weight struggles in women, Lipozem’s multi-action formula is designed to support both sexes equally—helping restore fat-burning from the inside out. Do I need to follow a strict diet or workout program with it?No strict rules here. Lipozem doesn’t demand keto, low-carb, or intense exercise to “work.” That said, pairing it with a balanced diet and light movement can amplify your results. The bonus? Once inflammation drops and cravings calm down, many users naturally eat healthier without forcing it. Where should I buy Lipozem to make sure it’s real?Only buy from the official Lipozem website. It’s not available in stores or on Amazon, and that’s intentional. Ordering directly means you’re getting the genuine product, eligible for the 180-day money-back guarantee, and protected from knockoffs or expired supplements. Final Verdict: Is Lipozem Worth It in 2025? Let’s Get Real. Okay, let’s cut through the fluff. If you’ve been bouncing between trendy detox teas, metabolism “boosters,” and overpriced diet apps that barely deliver, you’re not alone. The weight loss industry is overflowing with gimmicks—and honestly, most of us are over it. Enter Lipozem—the inflammation-fighting, Triple-BHB-powered supplement that’s actually getting attention for the right reasons. It’s not promising overnight abs or asking you to live on lettuce. Instead, it’s designed to address what real science is now calling the root of stubborn fat: inflamed, locked fat cells that refuse to budge, no matter how many salads or spin classes you throw at them. The buzz? Verified reviews from 2025 say Lipozem is helping users reclaim their metabolism, fight bloat, boost energy, and finally break past those frustrating plateaus—all without the sketchy side effects of stimulant-packed formulas.

Let’s explore how SlimJaro tailors’ benefits across genders: For Women: Supporting Hormonal Harmony and Fat Burn Women often face weight-related challenges due to hormonal fluctuations caused by pregnancy, PCOS, menopause, or thyroid issues. These hormonal changes can result in increased appetite, slow metabolism, and fat retention—especially around the hips, belly, and thighs. SlimJaro helps regulate female-specific hormones like oestrogen and leptin, supporting: Many women experience an increased sense of self-control around food, less bloating, and a leaner midsection within weeks of starting SlimJaro. For Men: Muscle Retention and Belly Fat Reduction Men typically store fat in the abdominal region and often experience reduced testosterone and slowed metabolism as they age. SlimJaro supports metabolic restoration and natural hormone production that helps men: Men often report noticeable waist reduction, improved athletic performance, and more energy to stay active after starting Slim Jaro. Unisex Performance: One Formula, Universal Results SlimJaro’s formula is not gender-biased. It is suitable for everyone aged 18+, regardless of gender identity, provided they are not pregnant or nursing. Its natural, inclusive formulation makes it ideal for couples trying to get healthier together. The Origin of SlimJaro: From Research to Real Results The story of Slim Jaro starts not in a marketing boardroom but in a clinical wellness research lab where scientists and nutritionists focused on the root causes of weight gain and metabolic dysfunction. Through years of trials and testing, they identified a critical issue shared by most overweight individuals: a sluggish metabolism and poor fat oxidation. What fascinated the creators of SlimJaro was a discovery based on mineral activation and hormonal stimulation using trace elements found in Himalayan pink salt. This finding was coined the “Pink Salt Trick” – a powerful method of supporting metabolic efficiency and controlling hunger through a natural mechanism. But rather than making people rely on pink salt alone, the team incorporated this trick into a holistic supplement that combines modern nutrition with ancient wisdom. Thus, Slim Jaro was born – a capsule-based product that’s easy to use, gentle on the system, and powerful enough to accelerate fat burn naturally. The product’s creators wanted SlimJaro to break boundaries – not just in terms of scientific innovation, but also in accessibility. That’s why Slim Jaro was formulated to suit people of all dietary backgrounds. It’s non-GMO, gluten-free, soy-free, and free from harsh chemicals or stimulants. Since its launch, SlimJaro has exploded in popularity due to word-of-mouth success stories. Users from diverse backgrounds began to see visible results within weeks, driving a surge in global demand. What began as a niche wellness innovation is now a multinational best-seller, with a loyal customer base in over 25 countries. In many ways, SlimJaro is more than just a product – it’s a movement, reshaping how people view weight loss. It doesn’t push starvation diets or endless hours at the gym. Instead, it offers real results through metabolic support, hormonal balance, and appetite control – all rooted in natural ingredients. How Slim Jaro Works: The Science Behind the Magic? At its core, SlimJaro addresses the three main barriers to weight loss: Each capsule of SlimJaro is infused with ingredients that trigger a chain reaction in the body, beginning with metabolic activation. The Pink Salt Trick acts as the ignition, helping to stimulate thermogenesis – the process by which your body burns calories to produce heat. Once thermogenesis is activated, the ingredients in Slim Jaro mobilize stored fat, converting it into usable energy. This not only reduces fat storage but also boosts vitality, so you feel more active, alert, and motivated throughout the day. SlimJaro also plays a role in balancing key weight-related hormones, particularly leptin and ghrelin. Leptin controls satiety (the feeling of fullness), while ghrelin triggers hunger. When these hormones are out of balance, it leads to overeating and emotional cravings. SlimJaro helps stabilize this hormonal interplay, which leads to better control over portion sizes and reduced emotional eating. In addition, the supplement contains antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents that improve digestion and reduce bloating. Many users report feeling lighter, less bloated, and more regular within days of starting Slim Jaro. Importantly, SlimJaro works with your body – not against it. There are no jittery side effects like those found in caffeine-heavy fat burners. Instead, it promotes steady, sustainable fat loss by enhancing your body’s natural ability to process fat and use it as fuel. SlimJaro Ingredients Breakdown: What’s Inside the Formula? Slim Jaro isn't just another trendy fat burner—it’s a scientifically crafted metabolic support formula based on natural, clinically reviewed ingredients that target fat burning, appetite control, hormonal balance, and energy enhancement. Let’s explore each key ingredient in Slim Jaro, understand its function, and how it contributes to healthy and sustainable weight loss.

How It Works: Study Highlight: A 2009 study published in Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry found that daily intake of vinegar led to reduced belly fat, waist size, and triglyceride levels. 7. Cayenne Pepper (Capsaicin) Primary Role: Fat burning accelerator and appetite control What It Does: Cayenne Pepper contains capsaicin; a compound known to increase the body’s core temperature and stimulate fat burning through thermogenesis. How It Works: Scientific Study: The British Journal of Nutrition published findings that capsaicin increases metabolic rate and fat oxidation after meals. 8. Ashwagandha Root Extract Primary Role: Cortisol reduction and hormonal balance What It Does: Ashwagandha is an adaptogenic herb used in Ayurvedic medicine to reduce stress, support thyroid function, and balance hormones—critical factors in long-term fat loss. How It Works: Clinical Research: In a 2012 study from Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine, Ashwagandha significantly reduced cortisol levels and improved body composition. 9. Black Pepper Extract (Piperine) Primary Role: Bioavailability enhancer and metabolism booster What It Does: Piperine, the active compound in black pepper, doesn't just help digestion—it also enhances the absorption of other ingredients, making SlimJaro more potent. How It Works: Science Insight: Research in Planta Medica found that piperine significantly increases the bioavailability of various nutrients and improves fat loss efficacy when combined with other ingredients.

Slim Jaro’s Global Impact: Weight Loss Without Borders In today’s interconnected world, the desire to lead a healthier, more energetic life knows no boundaries.

Enter Slim Jaro—a revolutionary natural formula that has quickly evolved from a trending supplement to a global phenomenon, proving that effective weight loss isn’t confined to geography, culture, or background.

South Africa: The Outdoor Weight Loss Companion In South Africa, a country with a growing focus on outdoor wellness and functional fitness, Slim Jaro caught attention as a stimulant-free fat burner that enhances natural energy and supports sustainable fat loss.

Slim Jaro Benefits Explained: How It Transforms Your Body from the Inside Out Slim Jaro is more than a weight loss pill — it’s a holistic health enhancer designed to activate your body’s natural fat-burning systems, restore metabolic balance, suppress unhealthy cravings, and elevate daily energy levels. Let’s take a deep dive into the core benefits of SlimJaro, exploring how each one works, what makes it effective, and why it has become a global favorite for men and women seeking safe, natural transformation. 1. Accelerates Fat Burning Through Thermogenesis How It Works: Slim Jaro contains thermogenic agents like Green Tea Extract (EGCG), Cayenne Pepper (Capsaicin), and Black Pepper Extract (Piperine) that increase your core body temperature. This process, known as thermogenesis, forces your body to burn more calories—even when at rest. The Result: You experience faster calorie burning, even while sitting or doing light activities. Over time, this contributes to a significant reduction in stored body fat, particularly in the midsection. 2. Reduces Appetite and Controls Cravings How It Works: SlimJaro targets the hypothalamus, the part of the brain responsible for hunger, using natural appetite-suppressing ingredients like Garcinia Cambogia, Apple Cider Vinegar, and African Mango Extract. The Result: You naturally eat less without feeling deprived. This leads to a calorie deficit, the key to consistent weight loss. 3. Balances Hormones That Influence Weight Gain How It Works: SlimJaro addresses hormonal imbalances that are often the hidden culprits behind stubborn fat—especially belly and hip fat. Ingredients like Ashwagandha and Pink Himalayan Salt support adrenal function and hormonal harmony. The Result: By correcting hormonal disruptions, Slim Jaro helps the body return to a fat-burning state, making it easier to lose weight even after plateaus or menopause. 4. Boosts Energy Without Caffeine or Jitters How It Works: Unlike stimulant-based fat burners that cause energy crashes, SlimJaro uses a clean energy formula derived from metabolic enhancers like Green Tea Extract, Cayenne Pepper, and Chromium Picolinate. The Result: You feel awake, focused, and ready to move, without the highs and crashes of sugar or coffee. This energy boost also encourages physical activity, further enhancing weight loss. [Trusted by Thousands Worldwide] - Read SlimJaro Reviews & Real Customer Complaints! 5. Supports Healthy Digestion and Reduces Bloating How It Works: A sluggish digestive system can slow metabolism and promote bloating. Slim Jaro includes ingredients like Apple Cider Vinegar, Pink Himalayan Salt, and Piperine to improve digestive enzyme function. The Result: Better digestion = less bloating, smoother metabolism, and faster nutrient absorption, all of which contribute to a flatter stomach and enhanced fat-burning. 6. Improves Sleep and Reduces Stress-Eating How It Works: Emotional and late-night eating are often driven by high cortisol and poor sleep. SlimJaro addresses both with Ashwagandha, an adaptogen known to calm the nervous system and regulate stress hormones. The Result: You wake up refreshed and less prone to stress-based snacking, which can make or break a fat-loss journey. 7. Supports Cardiovascular and Metabolic Health How It Works: SlimJaro supports healthy heart function and metabolic performance by improving lipid profiles, reducing inflammation, and enhancing blood flow through ingredients like Garcinia, ACV, and Green Tea. The Result: Not only do you look better, but your heart, arteries, and metabolic system function better too, supporting long-term wellness. 8. Increases Insulin Sensitivity and Blood Sugar Control How It Works: Fat loss becomes difficult when insulin resistance is high. SlimJaro fights this with Chromium Picolinate, ACV, and African Mango, all of which help stabilize blood sugar and improve insulin response. The Result: You experience fewer sugar crashes, more stable energy, and a reduction in fat storage, especially around the waist. 9. Enhances Nutrient Absorption for Better Results How It Works: Even the best supplement won’t work if your body can’t absorb it. SlimJaro includes Piperine, which amplifies the bioavailability of other ingredients by as much as 2000%. The Result: You get the full benefits of every capsule, making Slim Jaro more effective than standalone extracts. 10. Works for All Body Types and Lifestyles How It Works: SlimJaro was created with universal metabolic triggers that don’t rely on gender, specific diets, or age groups. Whether you’re on keto, vegan, intermittent fasting, or no diet at all, the formula adapts to your biology. The Result: It becomes a sustainable daily supplement, not a short-term gimmick. Users across the world—ages 18 to 70+—have reported significant benefits. 11. Safe, Natural, and Non-GMO How It Works: Every capsule of SlimJaro is made in GMP-certified, FDA-registered facilities with third-party testing to ensure safety and potency. The ingredients are free from synthetic binders, preservatives, or toxic fillers. The Result: A clean formula you can take daily without fear of long-term health risks or side effects. 12. Backed by a 180-Day Money-Back Guarantee While not a biological benefit, this policy ensures peace of mind, allowing users to try SlimJaro risk-free. It also reflects the company’s confidence in the product’s effectiveness.

Title: Media, Tech Stocks Slump as Tariff Uncertainty Hits Earnings Season

Time Published: 2025-04-21T17:11:59Z
Full Content:
Apple and Amazon have lost $1 trillion combined since the president’s “liberation day” tariff plan was announced earlier this month Wall Street is off to a brutal start to the week, with the Nasdaq dropping more than 3% a few hours into trading on Monday morning, as the markets continue to grapple with President Trump’s tariffs and his criticism of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 3.29%, the S&P 500 was down 2.97%, and the Dow Jones had dropped 2.84% by 12:15 E.T. on Monday. Several major media and tech companies like Apple and Disney have taken hits to their share price as part of the downturn — more on that in a minute — and from a macro standpoint, all three major indexes are down 10% or more since the president announced his “liberation day” tariff plan on Apr. 2. Since then, the markets have been compared innumerable times to riding a rollercoaster, with wild daily swings becoming the norm the past few weeks. The Trump Administration on Friday signaled it was getting closer to working out a trade deal with China, although nothing concrete has been announced. The markets appear to have wanted a bit more clarity by the time trading started on Monday, especially as earnings season has kicked off. Last week, Netflix reported sales of $10.5 billion in the first quarter — up 12% year-over-year. Netflix’s stock is up 2.15% on Monday to $994 per share. A number of other big tech and media companies, including Meta, Spotify, Comcast and Disney, are set to report their first quarter earnings over the next few weeks. Something else that likely did not boost investor confidence on Monday was the president slamming Powell as a “major loser” who should cut interest rates. Apple, the world’s most valuable company, is down 3.05% on Monday. Since Apr. 2, the tech giant has seen $700 billion shaved from its market cap, as investors have worried about the tariff on Chinese imports hitting Apple devices. Amazon is down 3.49% on Monday and has had its valuation drop from $2.07 trillion to $177 trillion since the start of April.

More circulate on social media about Microsoft ceasing operations in China and laying off tech workers in China. (Photo by Ying Tang/NurPhoto via Getty Images) The headlines are full of Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPU madness, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) China risk, and Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) margin implosion - but while the rest of the Mag 7 dance on a tightrope, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is quietly setting up for what could be a 20–25% upside, putting a $500 price tag within reach. As an aside, do deficits matter? See: The U.S. Trade Deficit Math In Four Lines. You don’t need hype when you have compounding cash flows, irreplaceable products, and a balance sheet strong enough to fund a small country. This isn’t a meme trade - it’s a fortress stock. It’s hard not to have it in your portfolio. And if you do not want to undertake the painstaking and meticulous process of identifying the right portfolio mix, consider our High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Let’s break down why smart money could rotate into Microsoft - and fast. Let’s start with this: Microsoft generates $100 Bil+, in fact > $115 Bil , in operating profit annually. So you have a company that’s growing faster than Apple, is cheaper than Nvidia, has better margin than Amazon, and is less volatile than Tesla. Why won’t you have it in your portfolio? Unlike Apple or Nvidia, Microsoft doesn’t ship chips or assemble phones in China. And that matters. In a de-globalizing world, Microsoft’s geopolitical footprint is a superpower. Right now, Nvidia and Meta have stolen the spotlight. But valuations are stretched, and institutional funds know rotation is coming. This is what positioning before the crowd looks like. Microsoft is exciting, isn’t it? But investing in a single stock can be risky no matter what. We diversify away this risk while giving upside exposure in Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

The Tysons, Virginia-based firm now owns 538,000 Bitcoin worth $47.2 billion following Bitcoin’s climb above $88,000 on Sunday, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. The software firm said it scooped the asset up for an average price of $84,800 last week. Strategy said the acquisition was made using proceeds from two recent equity offerings: the firm received $548 million in proceeds by issuing Class A common shares, while Strategy also gained $8 million from the sale of its so-called perpetual “STRK” preferred stock. Uncertainty surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war has weighed on risk assets in recent weeks, as economists pencil in slower growth and higher costs for consumers in the U.S., yet Strategy has bought Bitcoin fairly consistently since mid-March. Over the past six Mondays, Strategy has said that it bought Bitcoin on five of them. The size of Strategy’s recent Bitcoin purchases has varied, however. After buying $11 million worth of Bitcoin in mid-March, it spent $1.9 billion on Bitcoin two weeks later, per Saylor Tracker. Strategy’s shares were recently trading at about $322, up 1.6% on the day, according to Nasdaq. The stock changed hands as high as $328 during pre-market trading on Monday but plunged as low as $317 after the opening bell. On Sunday, Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor noted on X, formerly Twitter, that the company isn’t a niche option for gaining exposure to Bitcoin’s price anymore. Based on public data, 13,000 institutions hold Strategy’s stock directly, along with 814,000 accounts tied to retail investors, he said. In addition, Saylor said 55 million investors have “indirect exposure through ETFs, mutual funds, pensions, and insurance portfolios. Strategy was added to the Nasdaq 100 in December, a milestone placing it within the coveted ranks of tech giants like Apple and Meta. The company may also join the S&P 500 one day, but Strategy’s lack of consistent profits is currently a barrier, based on inclusion criteria.

Title: Verizon’s consumer chief: Net neutrality ‘went literally nowhere’

Sowmyanarayan Sampath on the 5G race with China and the challenges of standing up to the Trump administration. by Nilay Patel Sowmyanarayan Sampath on the 5G race with China and the challenges of standing up to the Trump administration. by Nilay Patel Today, I’m talking with Verizon consumer CEO Sowmyanarayan Sampath, who goes by “Sampath.” As CEO of Verizon’s consumer division, Sampath oversees the biggest part of the business: Verizon Wireless, which has more than 115 million wireless connections, and Fios, which adds another 10 million or so consumer broadband connections to the mix. That’s something like a solid third of the entire country in business with Sampath. As you’ll hear, Sampath is a longtime Verge reader, and in particular he’s been paying attention to my coverage of both 5G and the net neutrality debates for a long time. So we talked very directly about whether the huge 5G investment had actually paid off — whether the “race” we were supposedly in with China was actually worth it, and what kinds of new apps and services actually come to light. You’ll hear Sampath say that network capacity isn’t a small thing, and 5G really helped with the explosion of mobile data — although I was told we’d all be doing robot surgery in driverless cars by now. The mechanics of all that buildout are fascinating to me, regardless of the hype. Building network infrastructure takes years — everything from figuring out what spectrum to bid on to making deals for towers and running fiber to them is a huge process, and I wanted to ask Sampath how he balances all those very long-term, very tactical decisions against the decisions we all see and feel in very obvious ways, like consumer pricing. Sampath had one of the very clearest answers to the classic Decoder question about decision making here — like I said, you can tell he was very ready to be on this show. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! Sampath and I also spent a while talking about the push and pull of integrating content and applications directly into the network. That’s something that all the big wireless carriers flirted with in various ways, especially in and around the peak net neutrality debate. In 2018, AT&T bought HBO and CNN parent Time Warner, right after Verizon bought Yahoo and started something called go90. For one brief extremely weird moment there, Verizon even owned Tumblr. The goal of all these media plays was to differentiate the various networks from each other, and it basically didn’t work for anyone — even though Verizon in particular fought the various net neutrality regulations that would have prevented this sideshow in the first place. Sampath and I got pretty far into the weeds on that. You’ll hear him say he thinks no one cares about net neutrality, and, well — I disagreed with him. And while Verizon has always fought tooth and nail against the sort of “normal” regulations like net neutrality, the second Trump administration isn’t nearly as hands-off when it comes to things like holding up deals because of DEI policies — something that’s happening to Verizon right now. So I had to ask Sampath if he was going to push back on that kind of clear government overreach as hard as Verizon has pushed back in the past. This one is all kinds of wonky, because it’s two telecom nerds going at it, so some notes before we start. You’re going to hear me talk about local loop unbundling, which is when multiple internet providers can use the same fiber to reach consumers. We don’t really have it in the United States — there are not four different ISPs all competing to reach your house on the same mile of cable or fiber — but many other countries do, as a way to increase broadband competition. The other thing you’ll hear us get into is something called OpenRAN. That’s an initiative the US government committed some money to last year that’s supposed to open up competition in the broadband hardware space and get US providers off of Huawei components. It’s a little complicated, but it’s a big bet in the mobile industry, and I wanted to hear Sampath’s take on it. Okay: Verizon Consumer CEO Sowmyanarayan Sampath. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Sowmyanarayan Sampath, you’re the CEO of Verizon Consumer Group. Welcome to Decoder. Good to see you, Nilay. I am very excited to talk to you. It’s a topsy-turvy time in America, but telco stocks are doing great. Everyone needs internet service, and there’s a really interesting dynamic there that I want to explore with you. But first, we don’t get a lot of telecom CEOs on the show. It’s hard to understand how telecom companies are structured. I want to start with the Decoder question because all of these companies have been built by mergers, spinoffs, sales, and recombinations. You were the CEO of Verizon’s business unit. Now you’re the CEO of the consumer group. Explain how all of this is structured and what the Verizon consumer actually is. The way we think about it is, we are customer-facing. We have a Verizon Business group, which takes care of all businesses — small businesses, government, large enterprises, anything from Walmart down to Joe’s Pizza. We take care of that. Then everyone else is a consumer. It’s you and me in our private lives. The wireless service, the fiber service, the broadband to the home — all that’s in consumer. The consumer business is a little north of $105 billion in revenue. I’m responsible for sales, marketing, product offering, customer care, and digital. It’s an end-to-end unit getting things done. Most telcos, at least Verizon, have a common network that serves all of us. We call it the Intelligent Edge Network. It’s a single network that serves different types of underlying networks and businesses, so we don’t multiply costs in it. That’s it. It’s a pretty simple structure. Go to market for business, go to market for consumer, and a common network that is a shared service that serves all of us. I’ve spent a lot of time covering telecom companies, and in particular, wireless and mobile companies. One thing that always feels opaque to me is the differentiation that you can do to a business or a customer based on the network. This was a big fight in the net neutrality days, that you’d want to differentiate the actual network for different customers in different ways, and that has waned. When you say you go to market for the customer, are you in charge of things like pricing and promotion, or do you actually get to say, “Here’s what the network can and cannot do?” Here’s what the network can and cannot do. It’s the whole end-to-end offering, including the product. The way we think about it is that a product is a network. Look, there will always be a good operator and a non-good operator. It’s historically always been the same. For a country as large as America, you’ll always... Look at the end of the day, we and my peers use the same steel to make the towers. We use common tower companies to take care of our tower business. We use pretty similar vendors. We use Ericsson and Samsung. Some may use Nokia. There’s a commonality there. But the secret sauce is in the operations. When you’re running a network this big, how do you take care of outages? How do you plan for it? And even small things like how you design your tower or the specs you put on your tower? For example, almost all our sites have generator backup. Whenever a hurricane falls or there’s a natural disaster, our sites are up and running because we have backups on our sites. Second, we like resiliency on our sites. There will always be a better operator and not a good operator. We know it. We’ve got 25 years of experience or 30 years, depending on how you count it in the space. There will always be a gap. Now, is the gap narrowing between us and the second network? Probably yes. But there’ll always be a gap, and that’s why people always choose us for the network. If you go and ask people who’s the better network, they’ll always end up saying Verizon. We have to stay on top of it by using more AI in our operations. Self-healing networks. Spectrum is another thing. We have to keep buying a lot of spectrum to put it... There is always a case for a better operator and a better network. I think that’s the heart of my question. Verizon, as a company, in a very reductive way, has to go to the government, lease a bunch of spectrum capacity, and go to a bunch of tower operators. I always think it’s funny that the biggest one is called TowerCo. It’s just a very literal name that no one except you has to consider. You have to go to a bunch of tower companies and site operators, give them the spectrum so they can operate the towers, and lease the capacity back from them to run your network. Your competitors might be on the same infrastructure or the same sites in many cases because it’s so hard to build a cell tower in many places. Then, somehow, at the end of that, the consumer perceives Verizon’s network as the best one. That is as much a function of consumer marketing and experience… When I moved to New York in the early 2010s, everybody had a Blackberry and Verizon, and that impression has stuck with me for all this time. Maybe that’s still the case that Verizon is the best, but what happened was I moved to New York in the 2010s, and Cingular had the best network in Chicago at that time (where I moved from). Then Verizon was the best on the East Coast. I spend a lot of time thinking, “Where does that impression actually come from?” Because no customer holds two phones in their hands and says, “This one has better service.” There are two ways. One is, is it a better network, and then the other is, how do people perceive it? We talk about national networks. We are the largest network because more customers are on us, but the end of the network is a very local thing. The vast majority of our customers, I would say 60 or 70 percent of our customers, never go outside a five-cell cell site travel zone for the year. Think about it, you may have a great network in Alaska, but 70 percent of your customers are not traveling within five or six-cell sites outside their home or their workplace. It’s a very local conversation about how good you are. Of course, there are some people who travel a lot. People like me who are on the road 150 days per year. It’s a different equation. But for most people, how good is the network at home? How good is the network at work? How good is the network during their commute? And that’s what makes the experience. You cannot have national standards to do these things. A lot of it is a local game. Getting access to sites locally. Getting access to better network technology at the local level. Having people who know the network topology at the local level. It’s a very local game, this network thing. And that’s why you see Verizon tends to do well when local networks come into play. How much impact do you have on the capital expenditure of building the network itself? You have a number of customers, and the business side has a number of customers. Do you jointly show up in front of the core network team and say, “You need to build more capacity in Connecticut”? The consumer group has 85 to 90 percent of all the usage on the network. Maybe it’s a slightly stilted conversation there, but the way it works is… Network is a little bit like scotch. It takes a long time to really become good. Decisions we make today on the network tend to show up three, four, five, or seven years later down the line because there’s a huge lead time to it. You’ve got to procure the fiber, backhaul the sites, and the spectrum to do that. The way we start is by asking, “What is the network I need to deliver my customer’s needs?” And it’s at a local level. In Philadelphia, by markets, what do I know? How much share do I have? What am I going to grow? Then we take that back to the network team and say, “Based on what assets you have, what’s available? Can you deliver this?” And 9 out of 10 times, they can deliver it. The one out of 10 times they can’t, then we move our marketing plans... If they don’t have capacity, they’re not going to get capacity in this market in the next few years. The second thing is having objective metrics of network performance. For a common person, if a call drops or a network data session goes down, it’s bad. But we track it a million different ways by design. Having that common nomenclature... Back in the day, it was dropped calls. Thinking, “How many drop calls did you have?” We used to measure every single one of them, and then if a drop call happened, we used to go and do root cause analysis. Now it’s data sessions. How many data sessions do you have? When did it drop? What were the speeds? How did the signal flow? Having really good instrumentation at the local level is really important. We’ve created basically a digital twin for every single customer. Every customer has a digital twin in the network where we measure the network 24/7, and we give them a score. Nilay had a score, it’s out of 10. You can say Nilay had a 9.7 score this morning on his commute from A to B. It’s a good score. If he had a score of five, we would go and understand why the score of five happened. Every single customer is monitored 24/7, from a network performance perspective, and then we track them through the system. When you look at that kind of data at scale, you obviously have lots of customers who, I’m guessing, have lots of different scores across the board. Where’s the median? Where do you want people to be? You want people to be in the eights and nines for the vast part of their lives. Now, one of the things with the network is... A bigger issue we have to face, as an industry, is that when things work well, nobody thinks of us. When things don’t... It’s a little bit like parenting sometimes. When the kids are happy, they don’t think of us. Then, when they’re less than happy, they think of us. It’s a little bit like that, because 90-something percent of the time, the network works flawlessly. Whether we’re discussing the fiber in the home or the wireless network. And we are largely forgotten, which is good. But when it doesn’t work, all the emotions come out in front. We are trying to solve for that one percent where the network doesn’t work, or we’ve disappointed the customer. Most of our work is isolating where it doesn’t work. Because where it works, we know it, and we just have to let the machine run its course. We’ve talked a lot about the mobile network. You also have oversight of Fios, right? The fiber buildout. Verizon has been up and down with Fios over the 15 years that I have covered this company. There are huge investments, huge government-backed investments, disinvestment, and reinvestment. Where are you with Fios now? We love fiber. Some of it is personal. Look, I built my career on fiber. In every role I’ve had at Verizon, we ended up building more fiber. Verizon was the first. In 2004, we created the Fios network. It was the first, probably in the world, to have fiber. We slowed down a bit in the middle; it was mostly a capital allocation issue for us. We always liked the business. We committed to it at an OPEX level, but we had to invest in 4G. We had to buy the spectrum to invest in 4G. Then we had to buy the spectrum for 5G. Some of the capital that we would’ve put into fiber then, we ended up moving to the wireless side of the business. Now that the 5G is towards the back end of its build, we are back in the fiber business. We bought Frontier, and we are going to close before the year’s end, or maybe in the first quarter of 2026. That’ll give us another 10 million homes. Nilay, we’re going to have a path to get to 40 million homes of fiber. And fiber is so resilient. The churn is very low. The customer satisfaction is crazy high. Then, when you put the two together, mobile and home, the economics are fabulous. We are really committed to a converged strategy on fiber plus mobility, and that’s the business we are in. We are not distracted as a company. It’s very simple. People ask me, “What do you do?” I say, “I connect things, I connect people.” Full stop. There’s no other business we want to be in, and fiber is part of that story. Well, I’m on a Fios connection now. So if this drops, it’s on you. Just letting you know. Nilay, it ain’t dropping. I’m on a Fios connection too, and it ain’t dropping. Describe the structure of Verizon broadly. You’ve laid it out in a big way, right? There’s the network, there’s business, and there’s consumer. How many people do you have in consumer, and how is that actually structured inside Verizon? We work with partners, as well as... A lot of our call centers have partners. Some of our stores have partners. We have probably around 30,000-ish people in the consumer unit broadly. I probably end up managing, directly or indirectly, the 30,000 people between our call center partners and our agents to do the work that Verizon consumer is tasked with. The way we are structured internally in Consumer is that we have a gentleman, Frank Boulben, who runs revenue for us. He has all the product offerings. The go-to-market sits with him. Then we have Kevin [Zavaglia], who runs our field. We are the sixth-largest retailer in America. We have 8,000 exclusive stores between our brands. Kevin runs all of that, plus our relationships on the distribution side. Then we have Nancy Clark, who runs our prepaid business. It’s a fully integrated business. We’ve turned around that business really well. We should touch on that at some point. She runs that. Monica Hammond runs all our customer service, customer care, and customer success organization. And Brian Higgins runs customer experience and digital. A very typical structure that we have. I think most telcos end up doing something quite similar to this. Is there any innovation in that structure? We have a lot of startup founders come on the show that have big ideas about structure, and then maybe they land in one of two or three different ones. But then you see some companies show up and say, “Okay, there’s actually efficiency from rethinking the structure.” Telcos are big, regulated companies. Obviously, that shapes how you would run a company like Verizon. But do you see any efficiency there compared to your big competitors like AT&T or T-Mobile? I was a management consultant. I was with a Boston Consulting Group for a very, very long time before this. We had a strong thesis on organization and structure. Then I became a day-to-day operator. I think as long as your structure is not crazy stupid, it works. It all comes down to people and taking friction out of the process. Because any structure will have a seam in it, otherwise the president of the country should be running every single thing on a single day-to-day basis. It doesn’t work. When you break it up into a company, break it up into divisions, you’ll have a seam everywhere. The question is, how do you manage the seam? Because every time you ship a product out, you ship your org structure. We know it. Okay? The question is, where are the seams, and how do you take the friction of those seams out? For example, customer care and digital. One is the digital channel. One is a human being getting called. When you call up, does the lady in customer care know what you did in digital five minutes ago? There’s a seam in the organization. You have to go and manage those seams, not get too bent about who reports to whom and what structure it is. And I think people tend to change structures a lot, hoping they’re going to get magic out of it. But I think the magic is in friction, seam management, and never ever shipping your org structure on your product. Your product should not look like your org. The other big Decoder question I ask everybody is about decisions. You have a lot of decisions to make. Everything from going to try to buy spectrum, to customer-facing decisions. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework? I have a framework for decision-making. It’s a two-by-two matrix. Of course, any recovering consultant has to tell you that. On the X axis, it’s what I call a one-way decision or a two-way decision. One-way decisions for me are really big and very difficult to unwind. It’s things like buying other companies. Even some big leadership decisions, long-term pricing decisions, and big product categories that you want to be in. These are one-way decisions. The cost to unwind is very high, very painful, and will take a toll on the company and its finances. That’s one. Then I have what I call two-way decisions. It’s a promotion. It’s moving a few people around in the markets. It’s trying different things with retailers, trying different compensation things. These are two-way decisions. They can be reversed. Damage can be limited. You could make a bad decision, but you can limit the damage. Then on the other axis, I have low dollars and high dollars. Low dollar, I have a certain threshold in my head. These are low-dollar decisions. And then you have high-dollar decisions. You never want to spend time with one-way, low-dollar decisions. They’re just bad. You should never even have one of those, but people spend time in companies on that. I work very hard not to make those decisions at all. Because if something is a one-way decision and big enough, it had better have a high impact. If it’s low impact, you shouldn’t do it because there’s risk in it, and it’s not worth it. Anything that is a two-way decision, that is also low-dollar, you should delegate it. Someone else can make the decision, you’ll be fine. And you have to trust the governance model, that there are checks and balances, so nothing bad happens. I try to spend 60 percent of my time on one-way decisions that are high-dollar value. Where to invest? What categories to do? Who are the big leadership positions I want to fill with talent? And I map every decision down to this framework, and I actively manage it. Just moving from a staff role into a large ops role, the best way to understand how a company runs is to follow the decision-making style. How do decisions get made? Who makes them? Who has the pocket vetoes? You can understand every single thing about a group you’ve inherited by just following decisions. Take five decisions, and track them end-to-end. That’s it. That’s all you need to know. You know about people. You know about pocket vetoes. You know who the naysayers are. You know who’s not ambitious, and you know about talent. For me, decision-making is a science and an art, and one that I practice really aggressively every time I can. That was the best answer to the decision-making question we’ve ever gotten, but that’s the thesis of the show, right? Inside the question about structure and decision-making, I can tell you about 80 percent of your company. I know it from the jump, and then we can go on to the actual specifics. But yours is an interesting answer because you’ve devalued the structure question, and you’ve raised the value of the decision question. Most folks do it the other way around. Why make the flip? Because I think organization is a people construct. When people like each other, when they feel like their work is well taken care of and appreciated, and they’re in a well-supported framework, they’ll give it their best. I think people use structure sometimes to pit people against each other and give conflicting priorities to different people, thinking they’re going to get the best answer. I do not believe in that. I strongly believe... I have extra time sometimes. Rare, but I do have extra time. This afternoon from 4PM to 6PM, I don’t have anything on my calendar. I will go back and say, “Where can I take the friction out of the organization?” Because when my role is... The best use of my time is when I take the friction out. For example, there may be friction between two groups. I go sit down with them, “Tell me, why is there friction? Oh, we have an issue with priorities. Let’s go sort it out.” The minute we take the friction out, people work well together. Organization gets devalued completely. Then it all comes back to decision-making. And second is… Organization is always a moment-in-time issue because priorities change, people change, and organizations change. You can’t use an org structure to drive performance in the field and priorities. I like decision-making as a more powerful tool to do that. And the second is, how much data is enough to make a decision? This is something, I think, a lot more material should be written about. I promise I will not write a book on this when I retire. People think there are some groups that think they need 100 percent of the data to make a decision. Some make it on a gut. I don’t think both are right or wrong, but we also need a good framework for that as well. Like, “When are you ready to pull the trigger on things?” It’s difficult in big companies, but it’s also very difficult in startups, and I think it’s a very different construct. Because in my business, I know the market, I know the customer. I have 100 years’ worth of customer experience and customer elasticity models to work with. It’s a very different thing. When in startup mode, you’re creating a category. TAM doesn’t exist. You’re stretching PowerPoint to make your TAM real. You have to rely more on the gut to make those calls. When it comes to people decisions, you can put them through evaluation, but you have to make decisions based on gut [feelings]. But when we’re making a pricing promotion, or product-fit decisions in my world, I think it’s a little more data-driven. That is another area where I think I’ll become a better manager if I practice more of that. Let’s put some of this into practice. Let’s just walk through an easy one here. Verizon just announced a three-year price lock for customers. This is right on top of the Trump tariffs. I always wonder how these decisions get made. A long, long time ago, I asked another network executive, “Why is this pricing like this?” And the answer — this is a real answer that I received from your other big competitor, but a decade ago — was, “Well, this is how the computer system works. To make it different, we would have to reprogram a bunch of billing systems, and that’s costly. This is how our pricing works.” It was a very honest answer. It was also somewhat disillusioning, in the moment, that the pricing of the network plan was more related to the structure of the computer system that ran the billing than anything customers could perceive. I’m assuming it’s been a decade. I’m assuming everyone has upgraded their billing systems. But you announced this three-year price lock right on top of the tariffs. The marketing is that you want to give customers predictability. Lots of people have lots of feelings about wireless pricing. I have lots of feelings about wireless pricing. But that decision, you’re going to lock rates for three years, that touches your marketing, revenue, and forecasting. How do you make that kind of decision? We are in the middle of a large turnaround in the consumer business. Verizon used to take the most share of the growth. We had the lowest churn in ‘21. In 2021 and ‘22, we lost our way a little bit. My chairman, Hans, spoke about it. We got sloppy. We know it. Since then, we have been back on the turnaround track to do that. It’s a three-step turnaround. Step one for me was to fix sales. Fix our stores, fix our compensation system. Become a local company. We came to national… Everything was decided in this building. It didn’t make sense for a company our size. Step two was to take care of a price premium. We had a 40 percent price premium to the market on our plans. I think that is unsustainable for us. Look, we had a better network, we knew it, but 40 percent was too much for us. So we tweaked it. We are now down to 10 percent, 10 to 15 percent, depending on how we look at it. I think it is sustainable. We are growing our non-connectivity business really well. The third journey for me was to get my churn back in shape. Churn is the number of customers who end up leaving us every single month. It’s still very low. It’s like 0.7 or 0.8. So think about it. Nine percent of our customers leave us every year, which means our average customer stays with us for 11 years, which is crazy, by the way. And in Fios, that number is close to 20 or 30 years, depending on how you look at it. It’s a loyal base, but you want churn to go down every single time because it’s expensive to acquire customers. We spend a lot of money upfront acquiring them. For me, it was how do you get churn in a much better place? We went and asked customers. For the last four quarters, we polled customers. Nilay, I’ll give you a great tool that we built with AI, where… It’s an internal tool we built. Every day, I get half a million calls coming into my customer care centers. Every single day, they come in. And we take every one of those calls, transcribe them, and put them in a generative AI machine. At 9AM, I get a sheet of paper that tells me the sentiments, key themes, and what happened with all of yesterday’s calls. It is mind-blowing because earlier [before this tool], I had to call people. We had analysts who used to listen to calls, transcribe them, and make notes. Now every single call is put in a machine, and I get a piece. We picked up two very clear themes when I did that. The first one for me was certainty. People are like, “Everything in my life is uncertain right now. There’s uncertainty about the economy. There’s uncertainty about my job. There’s uncertainty about work from home. There’s just a lot of tension. I want certainty with prices, especially with categories I cannot live without. And phone is one of those categories.” Certainty kept coming up again and again in our reads from the market. The second thing that came up was flexibility. I never want to pay for something I don’t use. That’s one of the reasons why we took out all those inclusions. You get this free, you get that free. And people are like, “I know Disney is good. My kids love Disney, but I don’t watch Disney. Why should I have to pay for it?” Those were the two really clear insights we got from customers. That’s one. Second, we’ve done a series of price increases over the last couple of years. We had a couple in January. We know elasticity. When we do a price up, we model it. I would say the last price up we did, the elasticity was a little more than what we had modeled. That, coupled with all the insights we got from the customer, we had to respond and tell the customers that we are going to lock prices for three years. Now, it gives customers certainty. It puts a little more pressure back on us because we have to drive revenue in other ways. We have clear ways to do that, but I think it’s an industry first, especially now. Look, we knew the tariffs were coming in the day before yesterday. It was announced... It’s on TV. We are very comfortable doing that because, at a time of uncertainty, we want to give our customers some certainty and some peace of mind. All right, I’m going to be pretty hard on you now. I have covered the telecom industry for a long time. I noticed yesterday [April 3] that every other stock in the world dropped, and telecoms went up. Because people have to have your service, right? It is a requirement of modernity to be connected to the internet and to have a phone. And it feels like one of the reasons fiber customers stick around for a long time is that there’s nowhere else to go, right? The switching costs are very high, or maybe infinite, because there’s literally no other competitor that can offer the service that Fios offers, in many places. That’s true for every residential broadband provider, as competition is generally low. In mobile, the competition is basically you and AT&T, and then T-Mobile is a very strong challenger that’s gotten bigger. But Verizon and AT&T are the biggest players still. There was supposed to be a fourth player, and the government created this Dish Network deal, which I will ask you about soon. That has gone nowhere, right? There’s not actually a fourth national carrier that competes with you. When you say customers stick around for a long time, what I see is, well, there’s nowhere else to go, right? How much does that come to your thinking that, actually, a Fios customer can’t leave? A Fios customer can leave tomorrow morning. Every single Fios customer today can move to cable broadband that afternoon. There are very few Fios customers who don’t have a cable competitor in play. I just think Fios is a better solution. It’s a significantly better solution than cable because of the pricing practices they’ve had and the quality of their network. But there is a full- I hear you, and I’m sorry to interrupt, but I’ve heard that line from many, many, many telco executives in the United States. I look at the United Kingdom, for example, where they’ve done local loop unbundling. And, actually, my colleagues who live in London have 15 fiber providers at much lower prices and much higher speeds because the presence of competition is so much higher, right? It’s not literally switching from fiber to cable, a different kind of network, it’s different providers within the same fiber network offering more competition. We’ve not done that here, but they’re always switching, and you can see the prices come down because of it. I think it’s a careful balance. Canada has moved to a local loop unbundling scenario as well. The UK has always had it. That’s why European telecom has one of the lowest investments in telecom ever, in any country, almost in any region of the world today, because they just don’t have enough of a profit pool and cash flow to reinvest back in their network. Think about 5G. We are going to get to 90 percent deployment in a country as large and diverse as us. Most European countries are not even at 40 to 50 percent deployment of 5G. I think one of the things, if America wants to be competitive, if America wants to compete with China, having high-quality broadband is super important for that. Whether it’s mobility or whether it’s that. And you want to create profit pools in the system to go back and reinvest. Think about it. I’m going to invest close to $18.5 billion in just capital. In the last seven years, we’ve invested $200 billion in the network. $200 billion between spectrum and fiber, and the mobility business. I don’t see any European carrier investing $200 billion in seven years. In fact, if they invest a 10th of that, they’re going to get an award. I think it’s super important for a country to be really at the cutting edge of technology, the cutting edge of fiber, the cutting edge of 5G. And look, when 6G comes, we will be the first. I’ll tell you that today. We were the first in 5G. We beat the Koreans by 12 hours. We will beat whoever else... And most likely it’s going to be China on 6G as well. I think it’s a national security issue. It’s a national competitive issue. We need to keep reinvesting in broadband every single time, and we are not going to stop. You’ll see us investing at the same rate for a very, very long time. And all our investment is in America, in LA. I’m not investing in other countries. I’m 100 percent invested in America, and I think the profit pool lets us do that. All right, we’re here at the end, right? 5G is done, it’s deployed. Everybody has the 5G phones. What were the stakes of losing the race to 5G? No one ever gave me an answer to this question. If China had somehow won the 5G race, what would they have gotten that we didn’t get? What does it mean to lose the race? I think the first thing is standards. You want a standard that... You don’t want a bifurcation of standards, and it may happen. It could happen in the chipset, it could happen in AI, or operating systems and handsets. You’re in an interesting phase where you could potentially see a bifurcation of standards between the Western world and China. On 5G, we aligned on a very similar standard, and I think it helped because you’re able to take the price of the technology down to do that. The second is to think of all the applications and the tech economy that you have today. The app ecosystem, the Amazons of the world, the Googles of the world, and the Metas. They rely on the mobility network more than anyone else. Think about Instagram, it is worth zero without the cell phone and the connectivity. In fact- No, but specifically 5G. Instagram was worth a lot on the LTE network, and most of the 5G networks we have today are not running on millimeter wave 5G or whatever. They’re running on LTE enhanced, right? We’re still running... The core of the network here in the United States is a hybrid of 4G and 5G. No, if we had stuck with just LTE, we would not be able to take care of the capacity that’s happened. Think about it, the pandemic happened, we all moved to working from home, people… We were able to take care of those networks immediately because we had 5G; we could scale up. So 5G adds capacity in a way 4G could never have added because it comes down to spectral efficiency to do that. And we also ended up adding... Look, at the end of the day, capacity is a very simple thing. You can either add more spectrum, which is expensive, but you can add it. We do it every X years, we do that. Or you can add more cell sites because you can reuse the spectrum, or you can get back to spectral efficiency. That’s the only three ways to add capacity. And 5G helps with one in three. It puts new spectrum bands into play, and it also helps with spectral efficiency. You got a lot more capacity out of 5G, and also took the cost of capacity down. Every incremental bit that abides, depending on how you put it up in the air, the cost goes down significantly. We saw a 30 to 40 percent reduction in cost per bit when you move from 4G to 5G. Without 5G, we could not have done that. The second is that we created a whole business around fixed wireless access, providing broadband by using wireless. It’s all on 5G. It ain’t on 4G, I’ll tell you that. It’s a multi-billion-dollar business for us. In a few years... Right now, probably 50 to 60 million homes could potentially get that. It’s another competitor to broadband. And what has happened is that cable has not been able to raise prices, and so it’s a lot more beneficial to customers because they have another competitor in the space to do that. The third thing, which I think has been a little underwhelming for me, personally, is new products and services using some of the 5G capabilities. And you never get this right because you have to get the network, the handset, and the apps all perfectly aligned. I don’t think that happened very well on 5G. I think the third leg of the stool still has more work to do. I think a lot of the AR/VR type new form factors that we are seeing are going to require really low latency, and that will require 5G. You definitely can’t do it on 4G. Sitting where I am, I’m so happy we did 5G. I wish we had done it two years earlier, but that’s always the scenario. And look, we’ll keep building our network, adding more capacity till 6G is up. I sat in all the demos of all the hyped 5G applications. I went on so many self-driving car rides at CES, powered by 5G, with the data center somewhere that was driving the car for me because the latency was low. I heard a lot about robot surgery — an infinite amount about robot surgery. Those were the applications that were promised. That was the vision of the war: that if we lose the war, China will own this set of industries that is built on the new network. It was not about network capacity in COVID, right? No one foresaw that what we would need is a more efficiently run network. It was not really about bringing prices down in any substantial way, because the only thing that ever happens is prices go up. That’s the spread, right? I’m just wondering, do you see the gap in how much hype there was for 5G and how oversold it was? And also the consumer reality of it, which is, yeah, everyone’s phones might have a little more network capacity. Yes, it’s great at the concert or the football game to have millimeter wave serving everyone really fast. I agree that that’s a great use case. But it actually didn’t pan out that the big set of applications we were promised, to justify this enormous cost and all of this literal war hype. It never came to pass. Yeah, I think wireless is one of the categories that has had negative inflation over the last 15 years. Think about it. When you had 300 minutes on your phone, you were allowed... Evenings and nights were free. You remember the time when you got maybe 300 texts. You were paying more for that than you’re paying today when you get a 5G phone with unlimited data, unlimited text, and satellite messaging included. There are very few categories... In fact, the only other category I can think of that has had negative inflation over the last 15 years is TVs. Flat-screen TVs have really crashed in price. TVs and us are probably the two biggest categories that have gone up. Everything else, prices have gone up significantly. All the way from eggs to others, everything has gone up. Our prices have actually come down for what we provide there. I think the industry is probably one of the most unique industries where we tend to give you a lot more for the same amount or a little less than we did 2, 3, 5, or 10 years ago to do that. The second thing is I do... Technology is interesting. For decades, nothing happens, and then in months, decades happen. You saw that with AI, right? You and I have been listening to AI ever since we were in college, and then suddenly, two years or a year and a half ago, the whole thing exploded. I think a lot of these special cases, new applications that we are working on, tend to be like that as well. It takes a while to work it. Look, I don’t think autonomous cars or robotic surgery are going to be the ones that are going to break the bank or are going to be the breakthrough services. But I see new form factors emerging. We may be in the last generation of phone form factor as we know it right now. I think you’re going to see a lot more control of the phones using LLM models. I think it’ll have huge implications for the operating system and huge implications on the app store. But I think this may be the last generation of smartphones that we see. And to power all of the other things, we just need a better network. The second thing is that we are doing a lot more work on 5G in the industrial space. It’s not something you and I end up using a lot, but in my old job, we used to do a lot of private networks, low-latency networks, running robotics, and factory automation based on a wireless network. There’s a lot more happening in that space. When you roll out such transformational technologies, you’ve got to play the long game. Look, Verizon is a company. We are committed to America. Look, we don’t do business in other parts of the world except for small business. We are committed to America, and we want Americans to have the best network, and we’ll keep deploying capital to make that happen. I think most consumers saw 5G as something that just sort of happened to them, right? They upgraded the phone, the network is there, and then I hear you on negative inflation and value over time, but the main thing that happened is you upgraded your iPhone. Now it’s 5G capable. You need a 5G plan, and that costs more than the plan you had yesterday. That is not true. But that was true for a vast majority of people across the vast majority of the industry. The plans did get more expensive. Actually, it didn’t. If you see phone ARPU, average revenue per user, which every carrier reports in some form or the other. ARPU has moved very little on a per-phone-line basis in the last 20 years that I’ve been in the space. And you’re getting a lot more now than you got many years ago. I think people have this notion that the phone bill is going up, but the phone bill is going up because they’re signing up for new services. For example, in my case, we are going to have a $2 billion business selling streaming services and entertainment services. Now, we give great savings. We give you a 40 percent discount when you buy Disney or Netflix, Max, and all the cool services from us. But the core phone service, as you know it, has really not gone up in price. And we’ve delivered more than pretty much any other industry for the price point that we do. And I’m very, very comfortable with that equation. It’s my job as the CEO of the business to ensure that we give more to our customers. Satellite messaging is one. It’s something… We found a way, we made it work, and we included it in our plans. You pay zero for it. I think we are adding significant value to customers, which is why our churn is so low. People can move wireless easily, but because of the value we bring to them every single day, they like us and they stay with us. One of the things that’s interesting there is the comparison to televisions, which you made. The reason televisions got so cheap is that the industry realized that putting a computer in the TV let them develop huge new revenue models, right? A $500 TCL TV is actually a revenue generator because there’s advertising baked into every layer of that TV now, or effectively a free Roku box. Roku owns the entire ad stack. That’s how they make all their revenue. It’s easy for them to subsidize the TVs in that way. That’s not really the case with mobile handsets, right? It might be the case on maybe the low end of Android phones. There’s some subsidy happening there. With the iPhone 16 Pro, Apple’s not going to let you monetize that device as directly as anybody wants to. The push has always been to go up the stack, right? To go into the application layer. A decade ago, we had a fight about net neutrality where the carriers really wanted to be in the application layer and modify the network to prefer some applications over others. That has petered out. I think it burbles up every now and again, but it’s mostly petered out. Now you’re saying the opportunity is to bundle Disney+, right? To bundle other applications. Is that settled now that that is the strategy? Or is the push into developing custom applications for your network, or the push to prefer bandwidth for some applications? Is that incentive still there? I think what does Verizon bring to the table? We bring distribution. We bring billing and customer care. We know how to manage subscriptions. We bring a brand that has got unaided awareness of close to 100 percent. Those are the big things we bring. And I think what we’ve decided is that we want to build our non-connectivity. My non-connectivity business is almost $15 billion. It’s the size of Hilton Hotels. My non-connectivity business is a standalone company. And we partner with the best in the world to do that. I partner with Netflix. I partner with Disney. We have an insurance protection product inside that. We partner with other folks to do that piece. I think we want to use our distribution, our ability to scale subscriptions, our ability to lower the cost of acquisition, and partner with the best. But second, the more people use my network, the more excited I get. We are working very, very closely with the likes of Amazon, Meta, Google, and Apple to ensure that they use our network more to develop more services because we will monetize it at the network layer really well. Then, on top of the network, we’ll find adjacencies to sell in. But if people don’t use my network more, all the cool services I build ain’t going to matter much. I think we’ve pivoted to a strategy, which is single network, scaled network, put as much traffic on it as people can, and we’ll find ways to monetize it in a pricing construct if we do that. On top of that, we have adjacencies. We have six categories we sell into, and there we use our scale distribution, and some integration back with our network to make it real to do that. I think, in a way, we are probably the largest incubator in the world today because we work closely with companies for them to go and innovate services. It’s a pretty cool position to be in. And as we finish deploying 5G, we’ll start seeing more and more of those cool services come out. One of the things that I think about is that there was just an explosion of big carriers buying media, right? Because you have the distribution, you have the billing. It made sense to vertically integrate all the way up to the top. At one point, Verizon owned Yahoo, which was very confusing. You started what was like a prototype of TikTok called Go90, which failed almost immediately. It’s a long-running joke in our other show, The Vergecast. You owned HuffPost. You had Tumblr for a second. On the business side, you bought BlueJeans, which is a video conferencing solution. That notion that you need to actually own the icon that the user is pushing on or the media they’re consuming on the phone. AT&T bought Time Warner, another obvious disaster that collapsed almost immediately. Where did those incentives come from to do that? And do you think that they’ve gone away? Has everyone learned their lesson? Yeah, and look, it happens in every industry. Look, at the end of the day, you can either grow horizontally or you can go vertically. There are only two ways to grow. We went through a phase... Look, I was on the leadership team of Yahoo and AOL. I was sent from Verizon to help run those assets and eventually sell them. And part of the thesis was that we create data in the telco world, whether it’s clickstream data, location data, or other network data, that, if matched with online data, could create a better targeting engine for advertisers. That was a thesis going in all the way. But then we realized that customers trust us because we don’t share data. And it was a deep, insightful conversation we had within ourselves, and we realized that we should not be in a business sphere, so we sold that business. But, again, for a company our size, if you look at our enterprise value, it was still a rounding error for us. Fine, it was something we should not have done, but it was still a rounding error for us. At the end of the day, we are focused on our core. Our core tends to be mobility. Our core is fiber, and our core is cloud/AI, enabling those things. That’s it. Those are the only three businesses we are in right now. Carriers around the world have sort of come to a similar place, but we are probably, I would say, the most focused of carriers anywhere in the world right now. Verizon fights the hardest against any net neutrality rules that appear at the state level and at the federal level. We can set a watch on the Verizon lawsuit against those rules. It happens every time. You’re saying you don’t need those rules, right? If I’m listening to you correctly, you’re saying, “We’ve learned our lesson. We’re not going to monkey with the network. We’re not going to prioritize our own services or someone else’s services. We just want volume,” right? Pure volume is what will drive your growth. Why fight against the rules if you’ve already come to the same conclusion? I don’t know what net neutrality does. I’ve been in this business for a little north of 20 years. Before that, I was in college, having fun. And I still don’t know what problem we are trying to solve with net neutrality. I actually don’t understand that, because at the end of the day, if there are 300 people using a congested road, and if a firefighter needs to go through, people are going to move aside and let him go through. That’s all we are saying. For traffic management purposes, we need to have some controls in the network. Otherwise, when in New York City, when the traffic core or the emergency services want access and it’s congested, I’m going to have to move people off so they get priority service. That’s all it is. And we need traffic management tools. Or you have one person in your town who’s sucking up all the bandwidth, and we have places like that where they use 100 or 200 times the average bandwidth. And because of that, 99 percent of the people are getting a shitty experience. We’ve got to manage the traffic. That’s all we are saying about it. I think this was a little bit of drama about nothing. And at the end of the day, we want to build networks and we want people to use them. We just want the ability to manage network management in a way that’s good for the broad set of people. I don’t think we really care about making one group better versus one group worse, which is why I think it got no traction, because I don’t know what problem it was trying to solve. To be clear, it did get traction. It passed through the FCC under Title II in one administration. It was undone by another administration. I have never encountered a net neutrality rule at the federal or state level that hasn’t allowed for reasonable network management practices, right? That’s always the heart of the rule. It’s really: can you prefer some content and services over others, right? No blocking, no throttling. It’s the heart of the rules, and Verizon has fought against those. I have seen your competitors do things like sponsor data, right? I’ll let you off the hook for one second. AT&T, when they owned Max, exempted Max from their own data caps, which was just openly unfair, right? It’s just straightforwardly unfair that using Netflix would cost a customer money, and using AT&T’s owned and operated service would not. And that was an advantage that AT&T wanted to give to Max at that time. And that is the sort of thing that isn’t a firefighter on the road, that isn’t one person using all the bandwidth. That is a distortion in the market. That’s what the rule is supposed to correct. What good did it do for AT&T or for any customer in that scenario? Look, I don’t know what AT&T did, but I think at the end of the day... I don’t think a lot of these folks understand how networks work. Because at the core of these networks is a very complex set of technologies. You have the access network, you have the core, you have peering points, and you have the backbone of the network. Congestion can happen anywhere in the network. For example, if someone doesn’t come and peer with me, they’re going to get congested, but it has nothing to do with me. They’re congested because they chose not to peer with me, and they chose not to peer with me because they didn’t want to pay the $3 or three cents it needed to go and get a port in a particular porting hotel that was needed. I think the network is a very complex thing. It’s not a single pipe that starts at one end and ends at the other. There are a lot of different interfaces and other things. I think this whole concept that you’re going to unfairly manage someone’s network or give someone an unfair advantage, I don’t think it works that way. The second is an economic incentive piece. Look, in the case of AT&T, again, I’m being an academic here, which is that they bought Max, or whatever it was called back then, and they were willing to give up their dollars because network costs something. They’re able to give that up to drive sales of content. That’s a decision they made. In the end, it didn’t work out that well because it didn’t matter. I think there are economic incentives in place to manage all of this. That’s why I think net neutrality has gone literally nowhere because it doesn’t solve any problem that I think is a problem. Again, I want to be clear that it’s the law in New York. It’s the law in California. It was the law at the federal level, and it was rolled back. So, it did go somewhere at one point. And the most instructive thing I ever heard about net neutrality was that it was just the arc that Netflix went on. Netflix was once the loudest proponent of these rules. And then several years later, I saw Reed Hastings at the Code conference, he said, I believe it was to Peter Kafka, “Oh, we don’t need to have this fight anymore because we’re so big it doesn’t matter.” All that indicated to me was they needed the rule and they needed the fight when they were small, to preserve the access. And then they got so big that they didn’t need the rule to give them access because they were so big that taking access away wouldn’t be a problem. That’s the competitive playing field that I think you want at the application layer as well. It’s really hard for people to perceive. I think they didn’t realize it was a problem because it was not a problem. I think it had nothing to do with size. Well, that’s what Reed Hastings said. He said, “I am so big it doesn’t matter.” I know, but I think he probably said that to cover up something where he made a big to-do about nothing. In the end, it didn’t change anything. If customers want Netflix, they’ll get Netflix. We make shitty content, no one’s going to watch it. I think it’s the core of that issue. He very soon realized... I remember that conference. He realized this was a fight about nothing. At the end of the day, if you make good content, customers want it, they’ll appear, and you’ll get access to it. If you make poor content that nobody wants to watch, nobody’s going to watch it. Irrespective of all the so-called net neutrality rules you have. I think that was the perfect example of how it had nothing to do with size. It just had to do with the fact that they were chasing something that made no sense at that point, and he was the first to admit it, so he could focus his efforts on putting on new shows. By the way, I like their new show, The Residence. It’s a good show. You live in a different regulatory environment now. You have Brendan Carr, who’s the chair of the FCC. I’m not a fan of Brendan Carr. I think he’s wielding his power irresponsibly, and he knows that I think that. You mentioned earlier your deal with Frontier, that’s going to go through, and Brendan has been very clear that he will not allow these deals to go through unless you get rid of all your diversity initiatives. And he says there’s an investigation against Verizon on these initiatives. That feels like straight coercion. If Verizon wants to go body up and file lawsuits against the FCC imposing regulatory requirements, this would be where you do it. Are you going to fight that fight, or are you going to roll over? For Verizon, there are a couple of things. Internally, as a company, certain things are non-negotiable for us. How we treat human beings, human dignity, and ensure that we have the best talent pool when we build and operate the largest consumer telco company in the world. We ain’t walking away from that. I think that’s there. At the end of the day, we have to follow the rules and regulations of the land, and we will work constructively. We have a constructive dialogue with the FCC to ensure that we follow the rules and regulations of the land. That’s exactly the piece we are in right now with them. We got the letter from them. We are working closely with the staffers out there. Whatever the regulations or rules of the land are, we’ll follow them. Do you think that you’ll fight that as vociferously as you fought net neutrality? It goes down to the rule of law. Whatever the rule is. Do you think the FCC commissioner has the authority to tell you how to hire and fire inside your company? It goes back to the rules and regulations that the administration puts in place. They have certain rules, they work through it, and we have to follow the rules of the way it lays itself out. That’s all we are going to work towards: a constructive dialogue with Chairman Carr on that piece, and we’ll continue to deliver that. But at the end of the day, I want the best talent pool for my company. I will do anything that is needed to get the best operators, the best marketers, and the best network operators in the world for Verizon to do that piece. I’m walking away from that. I’m going to follow that. In the process, I have to follow rules and regulations — we’ll do that. And if there are some changes that have to be made, we will make those changes. But let’s not forget, this is about getting the best talent from us, and we are not walking away one minute from that mission. Literally, just a few days before we’re talking, I think T-Mobile closed the deal to do a JV on some fiber initiative. But to get there, they had to delete the word diversity from a bunch of its web pages. Is that the level of meddling that you’re willing to accept? We are still working with the FCC on what the rules are. How we develop the rules. How we execute the rules on that. It’s a work in progress right now. We are still working through that. But look, at the end of the day, we’re going to have to follow the rules of the land. We did that before, we’ve done that. We’re going to do that after that. This is just one of those pieces, we’re going to have to follow the rules that are there. I want to be very clear, I’m being very explicit about this. When the government passed net neutrality rules, it wasn’t, “We have to follow the rules of the land.” It was, “We are going to file lawsuits for a decade to get out of these rules because we think they’re dumb.” And in this case, you’re saying Brendan Carr, who has been openly censorious, openly chilling of speech, openly hostile to companies because they have diversity initiatives — you’re saying you just have to follow his rules? We have to follow the rules of the land. I don’t think those are his rules. They are the rules of the land and administration — Are you going to file a decade’s worth of lawsuits about these rules? We don’t know. We’re going to work constructively with them to follow the rules that are needed. But at the end of the day... Look, our role is to the stakeholders that we have. My stakeholders are my shareholders, my customers, my employees, and society at large. We have to manage, and we are going to deliver to those stakeholders what’s needed for us, and we will do whatever is needed with the administration to deliver to all the stakeholders. When you run a large company our size, you have to balance the different stakeholders, and we will balance those stakeholders. We’ve done it extremely well in the last 25 years that we’ve been Verizon, and we’ll continue to do that going forward. Can you put this in your decision matrix? When you look at an administration that shows up and says, “We’re going to start meddling with your deals.” From an agency that traditionally has not done this specific kind of meddling in how you hire and fire, how do you think about that decision in your two-by-two matrix? This is not the first deal we’ve taken through administrations. We worked with Democrats, we worked with Republicans, we worked with both sets of the administration. We’ve had good success working with both of them on that piece. Every time we take a deal through, there are trade-offs that have to be made. When we bought TracFone, we had trade-offs we had to make with California that were probably not perfect for us as well. I do think there are trade-offs that need to be made in any large transaction. But at the end of the day, you have to follow the rules of the land. I think that’s the most important thing, and we’ve got to manage the stakeholders. And that’s pretty much all we are going to do here. All right. I want to wrap up by asking you about a very silly thing from the first Trump administration. In the first Trump administration, T-Mobile bought Sprint. And at the time, that set of players in Trump one concocted a deal where Sprint would sell some assets to Dish Network, and we would invest in a thing called Open RAN to get away from Huawei and have more competition at the tower level. These are all good ideas in theory. Have you spent one minute thinking about the competition posed by Dish Network? Look, we have three large wireless carriers in a very, very competitive market. We have Dish with its Boost network, which is competitive in the prepaid space. They’re a pretty large player in the prepaid space. They’re starting to build postpaid. Then you have the cable companies today, Comcast, Charter, and Cox, all offer wireless services at very competitive prices. In fact, in many cases, the first line is free, and their average ARPU is significantly lower than ours. It is one of the most competitive telco markets in the world today. Three full players, a fourth facility player who is building up, and then a cable company that has 100 percent coverage of the country, which is able to offer wireless. It’s a pretty competitive market that we have in this space right now. No, but I’m asking you specifically about Dish, right? That was five years ago. I think June or July of 2020. That deal was completed. They had access to T-Mobile’s network for seven years. We’re coming to the end of that. They are supposed to have a next-generation 5G Open RAN that is a national competitor to you by now. Do you think they have a national, competitive Open RAN that causes you to lose any sleep? They’re a competitor to us. They have, I think, a little less than... The Boost network creates millions and tens of millions of customers — But that’s just what they bought from Sprint. That was the existing asset they bought from Sprint. That’s not the thing they were meant to build. They’ve built local networks. And do we compete with them? We compete with them in the space. But think about it, we have three full networks that are building up, and then we have competition. This is one of the most competitive markets. Look, Open RAN is a completely different animal. We should definitely talk about that. Look, over a period of time, Open RAN is a good thing, because it deconstructs the network a little bit. You can have multiple players in a stack. And for folks who are not close to this, today, when we buy equipment from a partner, we end up buying almost the whole stack. The head end that goes on to the tower, all the equipment at the bottom of the tower, is from a single provider. And Open RAN says, “Make those interfaces more standardized so that you can mix and match operators more easily.” I think philosophically, Open RAN is a good concept. I think more work is needed to get to the performance that makes us comfortable using it at scale. But what we’ve done is we’ve virtualized our networks more than any other carrier in the world. What does that mean? We’ve put generic hardware in our sites, and then the equipment providers have to load their software on it. We think that’s actually a more powerful tool in mix and match, scaling, and loading cost than sometimes de-standardizing or standardizing these interfaces. But over a period of time, it’s important to have more diversity of vendors and have more people play in this space. It’s good for us, it’s good for the economy. I think we are very supportive of O-RAN. We are part of the Alliance. We spend a lot of time, energy, and money on R&D and making those interfaces stable. But I feel it has a little more to go before they’re standardized, and they give you the performance that I get to put on my network. Well, Sampath, you’ve given us a lot of time. I feel like you should come back and we should talk about Open RAN for a full hour, because I can. I think it is fascinating. We’ll have to have you back soon. Thank you so much for being on Decoder.

Title: Cybersecurity’s Red Alert Moment: Hyperscalers Are Consolidating Power
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilsayegh/2025/04/21/cybersecuritys-red-alert-moment-hyperscalers-are-consolidating-power/

Full Content:
ByEmil Sayegh ByEmil Sayegh, Contributor. Hyperscalers are absorbing cybersecurity into their platforms — just as they did with storage, ... More compute and databases. Cybersecurity is no longer a standalone industry — it is becoming a native function of cloud infrastructure as evidenced by Google’s recent purchase of Wiz for a staggering $32B. As hyperscalers like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud embed AI-powered security features into their platforms, the $30 billion Managed Detection and Response market faces an existential threat. This isn’t just vendor jostling — it has deep implications for enterprise IT budgets, private equity-backed investments and even national security. For years, hyperscalers operated as neutral enablers — providing compute and storage while security vendors built the intelligence layer. But history tells us what happens next. First it was storage, then compute, then databases. Now it is security. The same pattern is unfolding again — and this time, they are not just partners. They are poised to be predators. History is the roadmap — and it shows exactly how they plan to attack and absorb this vulnerable, fragmented security services market. What was once outsourced — threat detection, endpoint protection, identity access management and data loss prevention — is now being baked directly into the core of their platforms. Embedded, automated and bundled — not sold as a product, but delivered as a feature. The original relationship was symbiotic. Security vendors brought innovation, the clouds brought scale. But now that balance has collapsed. The hyperscalers are no longer just competing — they are outpacing. They are building security into every layer of their platforms — from AI-powered identity controls to default encryption and automated threat intelligence. And because they control the infrastructure, they control the data. They have access to platform-native telemetry, logs and behaviors that no third party can match. The use of artificial intelligence gives them yet another advantage — one measured not in features but in speed, integration and insight. While independent providers race to keep up, the clouds are already embedding adaptive security into the very foundation of modern IT. MDR vendors like eSentire, Arctic Wolf, Expel, ReliaQuest and Rapid7 have grown fast by investing in automation and extended detection capabilities. But they are running uphill. These firms must build, market and sell their platforms to survive — all while hyperscalers quietly integrate competing capabilities into enterprise agreements. Look at Rapid7 — one of the only publicly traded players in this space. In 2024, it reported $844 million in revenue, up 9 percent year over year, with a 19 percent operating margin. But its stock fell 41 percent. Activist investor Jana Partners, holding a 5.8 percent stake, forced board changes and is now demanding a sale or strategic overhaul. Why? Because markets can smell what’s coming — margin compression and disruption from the inside out. Consider Microsoft Defender, Amazon GuardDuty, Google Chronicle and Microsoft Sentinel. These tools are not sold — they are embedded. They are often activated by default and subsidized through broader infrastructure contracts. They do not need to generate standalone profit — they exist to increase stickiness, lower churn and lock in the customer. In 2024 alone, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Meta spent over $250 billion in capital expenditures — much of it directed at embedding AI and security across their platforms. That figure is larger than the entire combined valuation of independent cybersecurity vendors. This is not competition. It is gravitational collapse, and it is exactly what happened in the last decade to smaller infrastructure providers. Artificial intelligence is the core disruptor. Hyperscalers are not merely building smarter tools — they are reinventing the security stack from the inside. AI is being trained on massive datasets, with full access to platform behaviors, identity systems and telemetry that no outsider can replicate. The result is security that is real-time, adaptive and invisible — not bolted on, but built in. That is not incremental innovation. That is systemic displacement. Regulators are waking up, but the question is whether it too late before the damage is done. In April 2025, Google lost its second antitrust case in less than a year. Meta is under scrutiny for monopolistic bundling. The hypercalers strategy is familiar — extend the platform, entrench the offering, exclude the competition. Cybersecurity is next. When hyperscalers start bundling endpoint detection and response, policy enforcement and threat management into their infrastructure deals — while underpricing or disabling competitive solutions — regulators will ask whether these behaviors mirror the extend-and-entrench tactics already flagged in other sectors. The questions now on the table in Washington and Brussels: This is not just a shift in architecture — it is a realignment of power. As cybersecurity collapses inward into the cloud platform itself, the ripple effects are being felt across the entire ecosystem. Every stakeholder — from service providers to financial sponsors to national defense agencies — must now reassess assumptions, business models and risk profiles. Managed Service Providers and Managed Security Service Providers built their business models on integrating best-of-breed, third-party cybersecurity tools — layering value through orchestration, visibility and incident response. But that stack is being flattened. Hyperscalers are disintermediating this layer by offering native tools that are cheaper, easier to deploy and pre-integrated with the infrastructure itself. Margins are under pressure. Many MSSPs rely on licensing arbitrage and volume-based resale models that are collapsing as cloud-native security offerings become bundled and commoditized. According to Canalys, spending on MSSPs is growing at just 8 percent annually — a slowdown from prior years — even as demand for cybersecurity services remains strong. That delta reflects erosion in value capture. Differentiation is also eroding. When every enterprise workload sits on a platform that already includes threat detection, identity and log correlation, MSSPs must go deeper — into vertical-specific advisory, regulatory mapping, zero-trust strategy and response playbooks. Those that cannot evolve beyond tool management will become expendable. The next-generation MSSP must pivot away from being a product stack integrator and toward being a trusted advisor. That means investing in proprietary frameworks, industry depth and human-led services that the hyperscalers — by design — cannot replicate. The private equity community has invested tens of billions into roll-ups, platform plays and specialty MSSPs under a common thesis: scale drives efficiency, and efficiency drives margins. But when hyperscalers remove the very foundation of third-party tool layers, that thesis begins to unravel. Multiples are already under pressure. Valuations that assumed sustainable 20 to 30 percent EBITDA on recurring security services may no longer hold. As bundled features reduce the need for outsourced detection or SIEM management, customer stickiness weakens — and churn risk increases. In several recent transactions, we’ve seen diligence processes stall or valuations renegotiated after cloud-native roadmap reviews showed major overlap with portfolio offerings. Even public market signals are clear — Rapid7’s steep stock price decline, despite revenue growth, reflects investor skepticism on long-term margin durability in this segment. Sponsors must now re-underwrite portfolios and exit timelines. The path forward lies in pushing platform companies into verticals or service layers that maintain pricing power — compliance-as-a-service, specialized forensics, incident response retainers — rather than assuming the old playbook of bundling tools will survive. There is no margin for error when it comes to national defense. Yet the same hyperscaler platforms that now power enterprise productivity are also hosting some of the most sensitive workloads in the world — from defense contractors and intelligence agencies to critical infrastructure providers. As cybersecurity becomes a native feature of these platforms, we are not just consolidating capabilities — we are consolidating control and amplifying systemic risk. This introduces a dangerous paradox: the cloud has become both the fortress and the attack surface. A single breach. A single rogue insider. A single software update gone wrong. That’s all it takes. The consequences could cascade across military logistics, energy grids, transportation systems and real-time battlefield surveillance. This is not a hypothetical scenario. The 2020 SolarWinds breach exposed how deeply embedded vulnerabilities can compromise trusted environments. In 2024, we saw how a single botched CrowdStrike update grounded flights, froze retailers and disabled hospital systems. The next time, it could be a compromised core service — not just a patch — and the damage could be exponential. Even more concerning is the opacity of the platforms themselves. When detection, prevention and response functions are all owned, operated and monitored by the same cloud provider, transparency disappears. Federal agencies are left with limited visibility and reduced oversight — unable to independently validate the integrity of the systems they now depend on. At the very moment when national cybersecurity defense should be distributed and resilient, we are centralizing it into a small number of hyperscaler environments. That may be efficient — but it is not safe. And it is certainly not sustainable. The same fate that befell private cloud hosting companies — disintermediated by the public cloud — now threatens MDR and MSSP vendors. This is not theoretical. This is déjà vu. And it is already underway. The industry has five years — maybe less — to adapt. That means redefining value, moving up the stack and delivering what the hyperscalers cannot: trust, objectivity, service and independence. If not, the industry will consolidate further — and this time, the collapse will be silent. This is not just a technology trend. It is a restructuring of the cybersecurity marketplace. And it is happening in real time. The only question is — will vendors, investors and regulators respond before it is too late?

Title: AppLovin (APP) Under Pressure: Analyst Downgrades Follow Short Seller Barrage, Investor Lawsuit – Hagens Berman

April 21, 2025 08:42 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads. Following the release of these reports, the price of AppLovin shares reportedly fell by more than 12%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the claims. “The allegations detailed in the short reports and outlined in the recently filed class action complaint, detailing the purported exploitation of user data and manipulative installation schemes, raise serious questions about the integrity of AppLovin's reported growth and the accuracy of its disclosures to the investing public,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: Congress’s Biggest Financial Priority Is “Stablecoin.” What the Hell Is That?

© THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Instead of tackling crashing markets, Congress is pushing a crypto sector that the Trump family is financially involved in. The Trump administration’s trade war with the world has roiled the stock market and threatens to plunge the country into a recession while jacking up the price of basic supplies. But instead of taking on the financial issues dominating the headlines, the House and Senate are racing to bring stablecoins — a cryptocurrency sector few Americans have even heard of — out from the shadows. The $230 billion stablecoin industry could be the first to benefit from Donald Trump’s promise to make the U.S. the world’s “crypto capital of the planet.” “Passing legislation gives them a first-mover advantage to profits that are to be gained.” Industry advocates say the legislation will clear up uncertainty around the regulation of their cryptocurrencies, unleashing a new era of financial innovation. Critics of the bipartisan push warn that the legislation risks another financial crash while enriching Trump, whose family is launching a stablecoin of their own. “Passing legislation gives them a first-mover advantage to profits that are to be gained. We saw that with the Trump meme coin, where a lot of people lost out but it didn’t matter because Trump’s platform was making fees,” said Mark Hays, of the group Americans for Financial Reform. “It just seems like a witches’ brew of problematic things that could lead to another crash.” To their proponents, stablecoins offer all the benefits of crypto without the downsides. They are pegged to real-world currencies, such as the U.S. dollar. The idea is that one dollar-denominated stablecoin can always be redeemed for one dollar. Stablecoin issuers use real-world assets, such as U.S. Treasury bonds, to back their offerings. Stablecoins live on blockchains — cryptographically protected digital ledgers — just like more famous tokens like bitcoin or Ether. Unlike bitcoins, they are supposed to be insulated from wild price swings by their currency pegs. That hasn’t stopped some stablecoins from collapsing. Boosters say that stablecoins can make payments faster, cheaper, and more efficient. They argue that stablecoins will make it easier to send money across international borders and create opportunities for the unbanked by cutting out traditional financial institutions. So far, however, they’re mostly used to buy other cryptocurrencies. Crypto traders use them to cash in and cash out of more speculative tokens without paying repeated fees. Former Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler has likened them to “poker chips at the casino.” Critics say that even though the biggest stablecoin was launched in 2014, the high-minded talk of improving the payment system has yet to produce results, and the only major users so far have been crypto traders, criminals seeking to evade money laundering laws, and people in the developing world whose own currencies face runaway inflation. “They have been around for a decade. There is no doubt people have been trying to turn them into a general-purpose payment instrument,” said Arthur Wilmarth, a professor emeritus at the George Washington University law school. “And it really hasn’t worked out.” That’s what their promoters would have you believe. In reality, stablecoins have “depegged” from the dollar dozens of times. As Sam Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent FTX exchange collapsed in late 2022, leading stablecoin issuer Tether saw its titular offering drop from the dollar by more than 2 cents. The second-biggest stablecoin, Circle’s USD Coin, dropped more than 13 cents amid revelations that many of its cash assets were jeopardized by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023. Then there was the notorious TerraUSD coin, an “algorithmic” stablecoin that was not backed by real-world assets. Its collapse took the token’s supposed value of $40 billion down to zero. Despite the promise of more concrete assets backing today’s leading stablecoins, even crypto boosters have questions about Tether. The El Salvador-based stablecoin keeps only 82 percent of its reserves in cash or cash-like instruments, dividing up the rest in more volatile investments such as bitcoin. Moreover, it has never subjected its reserve to a full financial audit. Tether is closely aligned with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, whose former firm Cantor Fitzgerald holds much of the Tether’s U.S. Treasury bonds. The very promise of stability can lead to runs on stablecoins, experts say. “If people think that even a few pennies of their dollar are at risk, they are going to run,” Wilmarth said. “They are not thinking, ‘I’ve put this money in the S&P 500, and I’ll ride it up and down.’” Trump has said he wants to sign a stablecoin bill by August. If it does, the legislation would be one of a handful of signature initiatives he approves this year — raising the question of why this niche topic is so important to Congress and the White House. Even supporters of the idea of passing stablecoin legislation say the urgency seems to be motivated in large part by the industry’s torrent of campaign spending. “That has had an effect,” said Tim Massad, the director of the Digital Assets Policy Project at the Harvard Kennedy School, who served as the chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission under Barack Obama. “There’s a valid substantive reason to prioritize it, in that stablecoins exist and we have been talking about it for a while, and I think there’s also some political reason why it’s being prioritized.” Two bills pending in Congress, the STABLE Act in the House and the GENIUS Act in the Senate, would largely accomplish the same industry-friendly goals if passed. Both bills would carve stablecoins out from securities law and the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission. And both would allow some stablecoin issuers to opt for state-level regulation instead of federal, potentially letting them to shop for friendlier jurisdictions. The bills would also create reserve requirements limiting what stablecoins can use as collateral, prohibiting them from investing in riskier assets such as bitcoins. That is also where critics start to see problems: The Senate bill would allow stablecoins to use money market funds, which had to be bailed out by the federal government in 2008 and 2020, as collateral. Meanwhile, both bills would ban regulators from imposing tighter reserve requirements designed to protect against market crashes. Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.

Neither bill goes far enough to outlaw foreign issuers of dollar-denominated stablecoins, potentially creating an incentive for issuers to move offshore and outside of U.S. regulation, according to Massad. And neither provides the Treasury Department with broad-enough authority to crack down on illicit finance, he said. Moreover, both bills would allow non-banks to enter the stablecoin market, Wilmarth said, opening the door for Big Tech companies such as Meta or Amazon to get in on the action. “Not only Big Tech but Big Finance,” he said. “They would have every piece of information about you if they could run all your basic financial transactions through their systems. I think that creates enormous concerns and problems.” If Big Tech does enter the stablecoin market, critics warn, a run on their coins could lead to a larger financial contagion. “You’re linking the commercial sector of our economy to our financial sector,” Wilmarth said. “Mark Twain supposedly said, ‘You can put all your eggs in one basket, but you better watch that basket.’” Last month, members of the Trump family announced that they were getting in on the stablecoin game themselves through their World Liberty Financial venture. The firm is helmed by the sons of Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. Like other stablecoins, it promises to be backed by assets such as U.S. Treasury bonds, with regular audits of its reserves. Massad said he could think of no similar move by other presidents. “Jimmy Carter put his peanut farm in a trust, but peanut farm regulation wasn’t exactly a big issue back then,” Massad said. “I think it’s totally inappropriate for the president or members of his family to be launching a stablecoin or otherwise engaging in crypto businesses.” The announcement of the Trump stablecoin didn’t just add another potential conflict of interest to the mountain of existing ones. It also alarmed crypto industry figures, who had been counting on stablecoin legislation as a surefire win this Congress after spending hundreds of millions of dollars on politicians in both major parties during last year’s election cycle. Both bills seemed destined to attract widespread, bipartisan support until the Trumps entered the picture. Instead, at a House Financial Services Committee meeting earlier this month, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., the ranking member of the committee, denounced the Trumps and said she could not be involved in passing a bill that would further enrich them. The House bill still passed out of committee with support from six Democrats, giving it a bipartisan sheen. The Senate’s stablecoin bill is co-sponsored by Republican Sens. Bill Hagerty, Cynthia Lummis, and Tim Scott, along with Democratic Sens. Angela Alsobrooks and Kirsten Gillibrand. WAIT!

Title: CE 100 Index Slips 0.2% as United Healthcare Plunges After Earnings

The CE 100 Index barely budged in a holiday-shortened trading week, down 0.2%. Earnings continued to dominate the headlines, and six pillars were lower, while five gained marginal ground. United Healthcare Declines on Medicare Advantage Outlook Leading to the downside in the “Be Well” segment of the CE 100 Index, which lost 3.7%, United Healthcare shares plunged 24%. The company reported earnings that CEO Andrew Witty said, showed “overall performance that was frankly unusual and unacceptable,” according to remarks on the conference call with analysts. The company lowered its full-year adjusted earnings guidance to $26-$26.50 per share, down from $29.50-$30. Revised guidance was lower than the Street expected, and the outlook was driven in part by “heightened care activity indications within [its] Medicare Advantage businesses, which became visible as the quarter closed, far above the planned 2025 increase, which was consistent with the elevated levels in 2024,” the release said. “This activity was most notable within physician and outpatient services.” Nvidia shares lost more than 8%, taking the Enablers segment of the CE 100 Index 2.3% lower. Nvidia said Monday (April 14) that its artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputers will be built in the U.S. for the first time, starting in the next 12 to 15 months. The company is working with manufacturing partners to build two manufacturing plants in Texas — one in Houston with Foxconn and one in Dallas with Wistron — and expects to begin mass production within that timeframe. Also within the Enablers group, and as reported this week, the antitrust case against Meta Platforms in federal district court began with FTC attorney Daniel Matheson telling the judge Meta “decided that competition was too hard and it would be easier to buy out their rivals than to compete with them,” according to reports from inside the courtroom. The FTC is seeking to force Meta to unwind its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, which the commission originally had approved in 2012 and 2014, respectively. The tech giant has countered that the case is “weak” and that the case engages in “revisionist history.” Payments-related names countered some of these losses. BNPL stalwart Sezzle was 16% higher. FIS shares were 3.1%. Global Payments sold its issuer solutions business to FIS for $13.5 billion and bought Worldpay for a net price of $22.7 billion. Worldpay is co-owned by FIS and private equity firm GTCR. PayPal shares lost 2.5%. The company announced that it and TerraPay are teaming to promote cross-border payments in the Middle East and Africa. The partnership is designed to speed cross-border money movement, while making payments more accessible by connecting banks, mobile wallets and financial institutions. TerraPay — via secure PayPal account linking — will act as an enabler, allowing mobile wallet and bank users across the MENA region to transfer funds to their PayPal accounts. American Express shares were up a slight 0.1%. PYMNTS’ coverage of first quarter earnings indicated that FX-adjusted basis, revenue rose 8% year over year — or 9% when factoring out the leap year impact — to $17 billion. Total Card Member spending also grew at 7% excluding the extra day. The full-year forecast for 8% to 10% revenue growth and earnings per share between $15 and $15.50, the ranges first set in January. “Our millennial and Gen Zs are performing significantly better both from a FICO perspective and from a delinquency perspective than the industry,” CEO Stephen Squeri said on the conference call with analysts.

All the sales were in January and February when Meta’s stock was still trading above $US600, hitting a peak of more than $US736 on Valentine’s Day. The social-media company’s share price has since slid 32 per cent amid the broader market sell-off. Another top seller was Safra Catz, Oracle’s chief executive officer, who unloaded 3.8 million shares worth $US705 million before the tech giant’s stock fell more than 30 per cent. Those proceeds, combined with her remaining stake and investment portfolio, give her a fortune of $US2.4 billion, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which is valuing her net worth for the first time. Dimon, CEO of the largest US bank, sold about $US234 million of stock during the quarter. He has a net worth of $US3 billion, according to Bloomberg’s wealth index.

Credit: AFP These are the most-read DIGITIMES Asia stories from the week of April 14 – April 20. Huawei unveils new AI chip just one day after US bans Nvidia's H20 exports Just one day after the US banned exports of Nvidia's H20 AI chip to China, Huawei launched its Ascend 920 on April 10. Slated for mass production in late 2025, the chip delivers over 900 TFLOPS, 4,000 GB/s bandwidth, and supports HBM3—offering a domestic alternative as China accelerates efforts to localize its AI compute infrastructure. Tariff maze deepens: US duties on Chinese goods up to 245% amid policy whiplash The Trump administration has issued nine tariff updates since January 2025—nearly equaling the previous two years combined—creating chaos for Chinese exporters. While devices like smartphones and laptops received temporary relief at 20%, tariffs on key tech exports now reach 245% for EVs, 195% for silicon wafers, and 70% for semiconductors. The layered tariffs, drawn from both Biden-era and Trump's ongoing retaliatory measures, create a convoluted regime with rates ranging from 20% to 245%, not including extra global duties on EVs, steel, and aluminum. TSMC hikes 4nm pricing; US clients scramble under tariff pressure Trump's tariff push has driven Apple, Nvidia, and AMD to increase orders at TSMC's Arizona fab, despite a 30% price hike tied to limited 4nm capacity. TSMC is now producing Nvidia's Blackwell chips and AMD's fifth-generation EPYC processors, with a 2nm "Venice" chip also taped out. Output is capped at 20,000–30,000 wafers per month, intensifying competition. Nvidia's US-based production, backed by Foxconn, Wistron, and Amkor, could total US$500 billion over four years. Analysts expect second-quarter revenue at TSMC to climb nearly 10%. Nvidia's China strategy set back by new US ban on H20 chip The US has imposed an indefinite export ban on Nvidia's H20 AI chip, citing risks of its use in Chinese supercomputers. Nvidia responded with a US$5.5 billion charge tied to inventory and commitments, sending its stock down 5% in after-hours trading. The restrictions also apply to AMD's MI308 chip and threaten key Chinese deals, including orders from Alibaba, delivering a major blow to Nvidia's China strategy. TSMC, Foxconn, and Wistron join Nvidia's US$500B push to manufacture AI chips and servers in the US Nvidia plans to produce up to US$500 billion in AI infrastructure in the US over four years, aligning with Trump's push for domestic manufacturing. Production of Blackwell chips has begun at TSMC's 4nm fab in Arizona, while Foxconn and Wistron prepare to build AI servers in Texas. Amkor and SPIL will manage packaging, establishing the first end-to-end US-based AI chip supply chain. Nvidia is targeting cloud providers like Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta, set to spend US$371 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025, with its US-based gigawatt-scale chip buildout. Trump hailed the initiative as a flagship success of his "America First" industrial policy. AMD advances US chip strategy with TSMC, joining Nvidia in massive domestic shift During her April 15 visit to Taiwan, AMD CEO Lisa Su confirmed that wafer production has started at TSMC's Arizona fab, with mass production of fifth-generation EPYC chips underway. AMD also unveiled its MI350 AI chip, built on TSMC's 3nm node with CDNA 4 and HBM3E, claiming 1.2x efficiency over Nvidia's B200. As tariffs reshape the tech supply chain, AMD joins Nvidia and Apple in expanding US-based production. TSMC projects second-quarter revenue growth of 5–9%, though demand may soften later due to frontloaded orders. Micron reportedly secures Nvidia certification for fifth-gen 12-layer HBM3E supply Micron has reportedly secured Nvidia's certification for its fifth-generation 12-layer HBM3E and will supply it for the Blackwell Ultra (GB300) AI chip. With mass production underway, Micron aims to lead HBM3E shipments by late 2025. Currently holding 5% of the HBM market—compared to SK Hynix's 53% and Samsung's 42%—Micron's entry into Nvidia's supply chain could reshape the competitive landscape. Article edited by Jack Wu

Title: Bhavish Aggarwal curbs ambition, seeks to raise $300mn for AI venture Krutrim

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. New Delhi: Bhavish Aggarwal is looking to raise up to $300 million for his artificial intelligence venture Ola Krutrim, curtailing his ambitions to snag about $500 million, after seeing poor investor appetite, three people aware of the development said. While there are no concrete investment offers on the table yet for the next round, Krutrim, led by its founder Bhavish Aggarwal, is “confident of bringing multiple big-ticket investors to the cap-table" in the coming months, these people said on the condition of anonymity. Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and SBI Capital Markets are the bankers involved in the funding round, one of the persons cited earlier said, adding that Krutrim will raise funds in a mix of debt and equity. The three banks did not respond to Mint’s emailed requests for comment. An Ola spokesperson said the company “does not comment on speculations." Mint could not independently ascertain the valuation being sought by Aggarwal for the latest funding round from investors. Read more: NRAI contests exclusion from CCI confidentiality ring in Zomato antitrust probe Matrix Partners, which initially led Krutrim's first $50-million funding round, is said to be contributing $25 million more in the upcoming round, the second person said. “The company is speaking with a number of top venture capital funds outside of India for additional capital—basing their pitch upon developing indigenous infrastructure and artificial intelligence models. No deal has matured yet," they said. The third person added that the company’s $500-million funding push “was a part of Aggarwal’s effort to complete the $1 billion fundraise before his deadline. That didn’t exactly work out." Aggarwal announced in February that Krutrim will attract investments amounting to over $1 billion by 2026. Krutrim, unveiled on 15 December 2023, is Aggarwal’s moonshot AI project that has claimed it will build foundational models for Indic languages, as well as India’s own graphic processing unit (GPU) chip, to make its own data centres and AI ecosystem. Krutrim is sanskrit for the word 'artificial'. On the 42nd day after the announcement, Aggarwal claimed to have raised $50 million for Krutrim at a valuation of $1 billion. On 4 February this year, Aggarwal claimed to have invested $230 million in Krutrim. This came after Aggarwal pledged about 8% of his shareholding in publicly-listed Ola Electric to raise debt to finance Krutrim's expansion. The funding round could be a key part of Ola’s claim to “make India independent of depending on Western companies for AI," as per Aggarwal’s statement on 15 August 2024. However, the company is yet to showcase the efficacy and veracity of its work at scale—something that investors and sectoral consultants said could be difficult. Read more: For the first time, India to make most of a laptop in-house “Ola is yet to release any peer-reviewed journal on its AI development, or showcase any product implementation at scale to build any kind of investor confidence. There are also major concerns that AI ventures do not necessarily need large funds as the cost of computing reduces, and India focuses on AI applications. Venture capitalists are also cautious as AI continues to change in terms of its fundamental nature, every few weeks. None of this would favour Ola’s push for a massive funding round," said Jayanth Kolla, partner at technology consulting firm Convergence Catalyst. Brain drain at KrutrimMeanwhile, Krutrim continues to lose senior engineers from its AI development. A senior industry executive with direct knowledge of the matter said that Krutrim “is yet to show why it needs sweeping funds to build any AI patent close to being comparable with OpenAI, Meta or Google." “In fact, at this moment, multiple executives including senior ones have left the core Krutrim engineering team that is led by Sambit Sahu," the industry executive said. When contacted directly, Sahu did not respond to Mint’s request for an interview. To make matters worse, India’s investors are not convinced about signing on large cheques to the scale of Aggarwal’s demand. “The investors that can offer such large amounts in funding are all based outside of India. But, the large VCs are focused on personalities who stand out with a world-leading pedigree of AI storytelling and product development. For Aggarwal, this is more difficult to pull off since his core competencies are not in AI," said Kashyap Kompella, AI consultant and chief executive of RPA2AI. Kolla said that relying on SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son—who has backed Ola before—may be out of the question “since Son is focused on pooling in his funds for the US’ Stargate AI initiative." Read more: SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son is making big bets, leaning heavily on borrowing Such a move could hurt Ola’s efforts to achieve its funding goal. Kompella added that the current macroeconomic environment “is not going to help either." “At this moment, Donald Trump’s trade tariffs are causing widespread uncertainties—with the markets fluctuating wildly. When there is business uncertainty, the first thing that is hit is dealmaking. Large funding efforts will thus be only concentrated around a few executives such as Mira Murati (of the OpenAI founding team), who stand out as veterans in the global AI industry, and smaller ventures without a clear-cut sector expertise may struggle to raise massive funding rounds," Kompella emphasized. The fundraising attempt from external investors comes at a time when Ola Electric is facing concerns over profitability and regulatory practices. Currently, it is facing questions from the Union ministry of road transport and highways and Ministry of Heavy Industries over the gap in its sales and registration numbers in the month of February. The government is also questioning the company's servicing capacity after thousands of consumer complaints emerged against its flagship electric scooters. Since debuting at the public markets in August last year at ₹76, its stock has lost more than 30%. From its peak, the share price has lost over 65% value in the past 9 months. On Thursday, Ola Electric's stock closed little changed at ₹50.24 on the BSE. (With Inputs from Sneha Shah) Meanwhile, Krutrim continues to lose senior engineers from its AI development.

When there is business uncertainty, the first thing that is hit is dealmaking. Large funding efforts will thus be only concentrated around a few executives such as Mira Murati (of the OpenAI founding team), who stand out as veterans in the global AI industry, and smaller ventures without a clear-cut sector expertise may struggle to raise massive funding rounds," Kompella emphasized. The fundraising attempt from external investors comes at a time when Ola Electric is facing concerns over profitability and regulatory practices. Currently, it is facing questions from the Union ministry of road transport and highways and Ministry of Heavy Industries over the gap in its sales and registration numbers in the month of February. The government is also questioning the company's servicing capacity after thousands of consumer complaints emerged against its flagship electric scooters. Since debuting at the public markets in August last year at ₹76, its stock has lost more than 30%. From its peak, the share price has lost over 65% value in the past 9 months. On Thursday, Ola Electric's stock closed little changed at ₹50.24 on the BSE.

April 20, 2025 08:52 ET | Source: Faruqi & Faruqi LLP Faruqi & Faruqi LLP Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP Securities Litigation Partner James (Josh) Wilson Encourages Investors Who Suffered Losses Exceeding $100,000 In AppLovin To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you suffered losses exceeding $100,000 in AppLovin between May 10, 2023 to March 26, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310). [You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. Then, on March 26, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a report (the “Muddy Waters Report”) concluding that AppLovin systematically used proprietary third-party data in ways that violated the terms of service of Facebook, Google, Snap, Reddit, as well as other platforms, potentially leading to backlash and service blocking and threatening the sustainability of AppLovin’s revenue growth. On this news, AppLovin’s stock price plummeted 20.1 percent, dropping from $327.62 to $261.70 per share on March 27, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding AppLovin’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the AppLovin class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/APP or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / APRIL 20 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives.

Title: The Nasdaq 100 Big Caps’ Big Price Drops: Apple, Meta, Nvidia Tesla

ByJohn Navin ByJohn Navin, Contributor. Nasdaq 100 These Nasdaq 100 Big Caps peaked months ago and have dropped in price steadily since then. Each stock has a separate, individual story but the Trump administration’s tariffs and their effects on prices play a big part on all of them. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell this week said that the resulting inflation may affect interest rate policy. It’s not a good mix, according to investors who have shown their dislike by selling the shares of these well-known names. What had been hot stocks are now in the cold as ice territory as the price charts show serious downtrends for each. Wall Street is having second thoughts. Apple daily price chart, 4 19 25 The early April slide below the August 2024 low near 195 is quite dramatic. The gap down from about $220 to just above $205 demonstrates the emotional quality to the selling. That buyers did not show up again until stock reached just below $170 does not instill confidence despite the short bounce that followed. That bounce failed to fill the gap down and the price remains below the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages. The tiny red circle shows the spot in early April where the former crossed below the latter, indicating the extent of trend weakness. The iPhone maker has been wounded by the Trump tariffs. Meta Platforms daily price chart, 4 19 25. Meta Platforms Chair, Chief Executive Officer and Controlling Shareholder Mark Zuckerberg cannot be too happy with the recent stock performance of the company. From the February peak of $740 to the current $501 is a two-month drop of 32%. The 50-day moving average is down trending as of late March/early April. The red-dotted line connects the February top with the April high and shows the serious downward slant of the price. Are we about to witness a re-test of the August 2024 low just below the $460 level? Nvidia daily price chart, 4 19 25. The semiconductor giant peaked in January at $152.50 and now goes for $101.49. For those who bought then and continue to hold, that’s a 33% loss. Note that since from that top to early April, the price has shown a series of lower highs and lower lows, the definition of a down trend. The 50-day moving average in mid-March crossed below the 200-day moving average, a further indication of the downward direction of trend. Although the price bounced upward for a few days, it failed to cross above the moving averages. It’s a negative as well that the April low dropped below the August 2024 low. Tesla daily price chart, 4 19 25. The November/December 2024 upward movement bears a certain resemblance to the Seig Heil hand gesture made in public in January by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Since the mid-December peak of $480 the stock has dropped to its present $241. That’s a 41% loss for those who purchased then and held on. The red circle shows where the 50-day moving average recently crossed below the 200-day moving average, an indication of trend weakness. Tesla has managed to stay above the August 2024 low, better than some of the other Nasdaq 100 big caps. A close below that level would not be pleasing to remaining investors.

More hot/cold feedback about how close to the mark one is and players may after time be able to generalise this to learn about likely hiding spots for eggs like in trees, under pot-plants in bushes for example. A quiet revolution is reshaping artificial intelligence, and it’s not the flashy one grabbing headlines. While chatbots and image generators dazzle, reinforcement learning, a method refined in academia over the past two decades, is powering the next generation of AI breakthroughs. Imagine a child learning to ride a bike: no manual, just trial, error, and the joy of balance. That’s reinforcement learning, which is an algorithm that explores, adjusts, and learns from feedback, akin to an Easter egg hunt guided by “warmer” or “colder” hints. This approach isn’t just changing how machines learn; it’s redefining what intelligence means. Illustrating the Three Types of Machine Learning: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement ... More Learning To grasp Reinforcement Learning’s s ascent, let’s first look at the two pillars of traditional machine learning: Both methods shine in their domains, and are used in combination yet they falter where data is scarce or goals are vague. That’s where Reinforcement Learning can help. Global interest in Reinforcement Learning has exploded since nature published two Google papers that ... More used to show how it could be used to train an AI to play Atari games (2015) and then that defeated the worlds Go champion (2016) Reinforcement learning learns by doing, guided only by rewards or penalties from its environment. It’s less about following a script and more about figuring things out. In 2015, Nature published a paper where Google researchers demonstrated how a reinforcement learning trained “agent” mastered Atari games using just screen pixels and the scoreboard. Through countless trials, it learned to win at Space Invaders, Q*bert, Crazy Climber and dozens of other games often with moves that stunned human players. A year later, research also published in Nature, Google used similar techniques to topple the world’s Go champion, which was a milestone once thought to be decades away. Reinforcement Learning thrives where explicit instructions don’t exist. It doesn’t need a mountain of labeled data but instead just a goal and a way to measure success. Reinforcement Learning edge lies in its efficiency and ingenuity: While OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, remains a private company, NVIDIA has become the public face of the generative AI boom. This chipmaker’s value surged from $200 billion to over $2 trillion in just two years. Many believed its advanced hardware, like that produced by NVIDIA, was essential for the massive data centers powering AI solutions from giants like OpenAI, Meta, Google, and Microsoft. NVIDIA’s relationship with ChatGPT has been compared to the iconic "Wintel" partnership between Intel and Microsoft during the rise of Windows. NVIDIAGPT Synergy: NVIDIA Share Price (Blue) Surges Alongside ChatGPT Global Search Interest (Green) ... More After Its 2022 Launch However in January 2025, DeepSeek, unveiled a new Large Language Model trained using Reinforcement Learning . This model rivals ChatGPT’s performance while requiring significantly less computational power. The announcement impacted NVIDIA heavily, causing its stock to drop more than 10% and temporarily erasing over $500 billion in value. Investors began to see that advanced AI might not always depend on such resource-intensive hardware. DeepSeek’s research quickly gained traction. Their paper, “DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning,” has been cited over 500 times, making it the most referenced reinforcement learning study of 2025. The work highlights how reinforcement learning can achieve high performance without relying on excessive computing resources.

Andrew Ng, an AI luminary and educator, touched on this in a chat with Toby Walsh at UNSW Sydney. Reflecting on his 2002 PhD thesis, Ng said, “My PhD thesis was on reinforcement learning… and my team worked on a robot.” His early bets are paying off today. Reinforcement Learning’s potential is vast: think more efficient energy grids, tailored education, or smarter robotics. But its autonomy demands caution and careful thought about the incentives used to train the models. An agent tasked with easing traffic might reroute cars through quiet streets, trade efficiency for disruption. Transparency and ethics will be key. Done right, though, Reinforcement Learning could usher in an era where machines don’t just mimic us but they illuminate new paths forward. Reinforcement Learning isn’t a footnote in AI’s story, it's a pivot. The hunt for smarter, leaner intelligence is on, and reinforcement learning is leading the charge.

Title: ‘Bitcoin Is Calling’ – Saylor Stirs The Market With Cryptic Clue

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Strategy chairman Michael Saylor, a vocal promoter of Bitcoin, stoked renewed chatter among crypto circles with his recent enigmatic tweet. Thursday’s message stating merely “Bitcoin is Calling” left many asking if a forthcoming significant purchase looms. The company recently acquired 3,450 Bitcoin at a price of $285 million. This was done after a short one-week break from their consistent acquisition pattern. Strategy has been steadfast in its aggressive acquisition strategy despite the fact that nearly all of its crypto acquisitions since November 18 have been made at higher-than-current market prices, according to reports. Saylor’s post might be a tease regarding another future purchase, given his history of sending such sarcastic remarks ahead of new acquisitions. The post also appeared to urge his 4.2 million followers to purchase BTC, which he has frequently called “the future of money.” Bitcoin is Calling. pic.twitter.com/0jo19Qbr5q — Michael Saylor (@saylor) April 17, 2025 Strategy’s shares have trounced the performance of America’s largest technology stocks, Saylor’s Wednesday filing showed. The crypto-focused firm has posted an astonishing 130% gain over the last year. These returns more than dwarf the returns of Tesla (57%), NVIDIA (30%), Apple (17%), Meta (4%), and Alphabet (2%). There is a @Strategy to beat the Magnificent 7. pic.twitter.com/TlD57hW0w0 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) April 15, 2025 Some top tech firms actually lost value during the same period. Amazon and Microsoft saw drops of 2% and 7% respectively. These comparisons highlight the significant rewards Strategy has reaped from its heavy crypto investment strategy. The chairman of Strategy has issued some provocative comments on BTC in recent weeks. Only two weeks ago, he asserted that the price volatility of the top crypto asset actually proves its utility instead of constituting a disadvantage. When someone brought up Bitcoin’s link with risky assets, Saylor contended this is so because Bitcoin is “the most liquid, salable, and accessible asset on the planet.” A day earlier than that remark, he underscored Bitcoin’s singular status among commodities by noting that there are no tariffs on it. His remark highlighted its digital nature and liquidity as central to what makes it functionally decentralized. Saylor has established himself as one of Bitcoin’s most vocal proponents. His tweets tend to center on the fact that there are only 21 million coins in existence, which he recently referred to as “the most important number in finance.” He has also likened Bitcoin to chess, although the meaning behind this comparison wasn’t elaborated in coverage. The chairman’s most recent statement comes as Strategy maintains its focus of continuing to buy Bitcoin for the long term, no matter what happens in the short term. With the company’s shares outperforming technology giants and Saylor’s ongoing public support, most crypto observers are now looking to see if another significant purchase of crypto comes after his cryptic “calling” tweet.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: AppLovin (APP) Under Pressure: Analyst Downgrades Follow Short Seller Barrage, Investor Lawsuit – Hagens Berman

April 18, 2025 14:36 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads. Following the release of these reports, the price of AppLovin shares reportedly fell by more than 12%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the claims. “The allegations detailed in the short reports and outlined in the recently filed class action complaint, detailing the purported exploitation of user data and manipulative installation schemes, raise serious questions about the integrity of AppLovin's reported growth and the accuracy of its disclosures to the investing public,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: Meta's antitrust trial heats up: Here's what we learned in week one
URL: https://qz.com/meta-ftc-antitrust-trial-week-1-zuckerberg-1851776650
Time Published: 2025-04-18T18:06:00Z
Full Content:
In week one of the Federal Trade Commission’s blockbuster monopoly trial against Meta (META), CEO Mark Zuckerberg spent around 10 hours on the stand as the agency questioned him about revealing emails from another era. This trial is only just getting started. Throughout it, the FTC will argue that Facebook engaged in a “buy or bury” ploy to eliminate its rivals and gain monopoly power in the social media market. Meanwhile, Meta will make the case that it is responsible for its acquisitions’ runaway successes — and that even after buying Instagram (in 2012) and WhatsApp (in 2014), Meta still faces formidable competition from the likes of TikTok and YouTube (GOOGL). At stake is Zuckerberg’s $1.27 trillion social media empire; if the FTC gets its way, Meta will be forced to give up Instagram and WhatsApp, eliminating “up to half of its ad business,” Jasmine Enberg, vice president and principal analyst at eMarketer, told Quartz earlier this week. The research firm expects Instagram alone to represent 50.5% of Meta’s U.S. ad revenue this year. Instagram and WhatsApp are both critical to Meta’s continued growth as legacy social app Facebook loses momentum with young people. Read on for a look at some of the key takeaways from the trial’s first week, including Zuckerberg’s old emails and the price Meta reportedly tried to pay to avoid the trial altogether. “The FTC kicked off the case with the biggest witness on its list. Only one other witness, the FTC’s economics expert Scott Hemphill, is slated to spend anywhere near as long on the stand as Mr. Zuckerberg,” Holland & Hart antitrust attorney Paul Swanson said in an email to Quartz. “Yet while the FTC confronted Mr. Zuckerberg with cringeworthy emails about Facebook’s schemes to beat back competition in the 2010s, none of that hit the key question: Is Meta currently maintaining a monopoly by virtue of the Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions?” According to Swanson, the agency didn’t get the “critical testimony it needs to show that Meta dominates a narrow market that excludes other social media platforms like TikTok and LinkedIn (MSFT).” Swanson added, “Mr. Zuckerberg deftly described a market in which Meta’s power is checked by competition from those companies.” In one example, Zuckerberg argued on the stand that Meta’s “growth slowed down dramatically” due to the rise of TikTok. In another comment, he said he thinks “people spend more time on YouTube than on Facebook and Instagram combined, certainly more than either one independently.” The FTC brought in old emails sent by the Meta CEO, and in one message Zuckerberg floated the idea of spinning off Instagram. He wrote at the time, “As calls to break up the big tech companies grow, there is a non-trivial chance that we will be forced to spin out Instagram and perhaps WhatsApp in the next 5-10 years anyway.” Zuckerberg added, “While most companies resist break-ups, the corporate history is that most companies actually perform better after they’ve been split up.” These comments contrast Meta’s extensive efforts to keep its “family of apps” together under one proverbial roof. The FTC brought in other Zuckerberg emails as evidence, including a 2011 message that called Instagram a “large and viable competitor to us on mobile photos” and a 2012 message that critiqued the teams led by Facebook’s chief tech officer at the time, Mike Schroepfer. “Messenger isn’t beating WhatsApp, Instagram was growing so much faster than us that we had to buy them for $1 billion,” Zuckerberg said. “That’s not exactly killing it,” he added, per a CNN (WBD) report. The following year, Facebook’s current chief operating officer, Javier Olivan, shared concerns with Zuckerberg about WhatsApp’s growth. Messages presented in court, according to The Hill, show that Olivan told Zuckerberg that he’d “been thinking hard about this for the past couple of sleepless nights since I am really worried … these guys are the real deal,” he said. Zuckerberg was reportedly worried at the time that WhatsApp could offer features similar to Facebook and “start winning in the U.S. and other markets.” Rebecca Allensworth, an antitrust law expert and Vanderbilt’s associate dean for research, told Quartz on Thursday: “So far, the government has done a good job using Zuckerberg’s own words against him, and he has done a good job deflecting them to the degree possible.” “But there is only so much Zuckerberg can do now to walk back on what he said then,” Allensworth added. “These are the worst facts of the case from Meta’s perspective, and the government laid some important blows.” Sheryl Sandberg, Meta’s former chief operating officer, also took the stand this week. There, the FTC confronted Sandberg about a message she sent in 2011, when Google debuted its now-defunct Facebook clone. Remarking on Google+, she reportedly told staffers that “the most important thing to acknowledge is that for the first time we have real competition and consumers have real choice.” About a year later, Sandberg said she “would block Google” from advertising its rival on Facebook, according to court evidence published by Bloomberg. Sandberg argued that these messages weren’t about putting its rivals at a disadvantage. “I said that to rally the troops,” she countered. Lots of interesting bits surfaced this week. In 2022, for example, Zuckerberg floated purging users’ friend lists as a “potentially crazy idea” to breathe some life into Facebook, according to evidence presented in the trial. Zuckerberg reasoned at the time that “wiping everyone’s graphs and having them start again” could reinvigorate engagement on the service, but it never came to pass. In a call to the FTC’s chair Andrew Ferguson, Zuckerberg tried to convince the agency to settle its antitrust case for $450 million — and later $1 billion, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. The FTC, meanwhile, was looking for a settlement worth 30 times as much, per the Journal. Going forward, “the big thing I’m looking for is some expert testimony on what is the right way to think about the market here and Meta’s alleged monopoly power,” Allensworth said. “So far, on that front, we only have testimony by executives at Meta and potential other competitor (like YouTube) about their perceptions of whether Meta faces meaningful competition from social media companies that are not ‘personal,’ like TikTok and YouTube.” Allensworth added, “Judges tend to put a lot of stock in expert opinion in antitrust cases, especially when it comes to market definition and monopoly power.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances AI responses by combining the generative AI model’s capabilities with information from external data sources, rather than relying solely on the model’s built-in knowledge. In this post, we showcase the custom data connector capability in Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases that makes it straightforward to build RAG workflows with custom input data. Through this capability, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases supports the ingestion of streaming data, which means developers can add, update, or delete data in their knowledge base through direct API calls. Think of the examples of clickstream data, credit card swipes, Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data, log analysis and commodity prices—where both current data and historical trends are important to make a learned decision. Previously, to feed such critical data inputs, you had to first stage it in a supported data source and then either initiate or schedule a data sync job. Based on the quality and quantity of the data, the time to complete this process varied. With custom data connectors, you can quickly ingest specific documents from custom data sources without requiring a full sync and ingest streaming data without the need for intermediary storage. By avoiding time-consuming full syncs and storage steps, you gain faster access to data, reduced latency, and improved application performance. However, with streaming ingestion using custom connectors, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases processes such streaming data without using an intermediary data source, making it available almost immediately. This feature chunks and converts input data into embeddings using your chosen Amazon Bedrock model and stores everything in the backend vector database. This automation applies to both newly created and existing databases, streamlining your workflow so you can focus on building AI applications without worrying about orchestrating data chunking, embeddings generation, or vector store provisioning and indexing. Additionally, this feature provides the ability to ingest specific documents from custom data sources, all while reducing latency and alleviating operational costs for intermediary storage. Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies such as Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Stability AI, and Amazon through a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities you need to build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI. Using Amazon Bedrock, you can experiment with and evaluate top FMs for your use case, privately customize them with your data using techniques such as fine-tuning and RAG, and build agents that execute tasks using your enterprise systems and data sources. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases allows organizations to build fully managed RAG pipelines by augmenting contextual information from private data sources to deliver more relevant, accurate, and customized responses. With Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, you can build applications that are enriched by the context that is received from querying a knowledge base. It enables a faster time to product release by abstracting from the heavy lifting of building pipelines and providing you an out-of-the-box RAG solution, thus reducing the build time for your application. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases supports custom connectors and the ingestion of streaming data, which means you can add, update, or delete data in your knowledge base through direct API calls. For this post, we implement a RAG architecture with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases using a custom connector and topics built with Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) for a user who may be interested to understand stock price trends. Amazon MSK is a streaming data service that manages Apache Kafka infrastructure and operations, making it straightforward to run Apache Kafka applications on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The solution enables real-time analysis of customer feedback through vector embeddings and large language models (LLMs). The following architecture diagram has two components: Preprocessing streaming data workflow noted in letters on the top of the diagram: Runtime execution during user queries noted in numerals at the bottom of the diagram: The implementation follows these high-level steps: To build a generative AI stock analysis tool with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases custom connector, use instructions in the following sections. To try this architecture, deploy the AWS CloudFormation template from this GitHub repository in your AWS account. This template deploys the following components: In the precreated MSK cluster, the required brokers are deployed ready for use. The next step is to use a SageMaker Studio terminal instance to connect to the MSK cluster and create the test stream topic. In this step, you follow the detailed instructions that are mentioned at Create a topic in the Amazon MSK cluster. The following are the general steps involved: To create a knowledge base in Amazon Bedrock, follow these steps: Now, using API calls, you configure the consumer Lambda function so it gets triggered as soon as the input Apache Kafka topic receives data. The Apache Kafka consumer Lambda function reads data from the Apache Kafka topic, decodes it, extracts stock price information, and ingests it into the Amazon Bedrock knowledge base using the custom connector. Now that the required setup is done, you trigger the workflow by ingesting test data into your Apache Kafka topic hosted with the MSK cluster. For best results, repeat this section by changing the .csv input file to show stock price increase or decrease. If the data ingestion and subsequent processing is successful, navigate to the Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases data source page to check the uploaded information. Within the Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases console, you have access to query the ingested data immediately, as shown in the following screenshot. To do that, select an Amazon Bedrock FM that you have access to. In my case, I chose Amazon Nova Lite 1.0, as shown in the following screenshot. When it’s completed, the question, “How is ZVZZT trending?”, yields the results based on the ingested data. Note how Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases shows how it derived the answer, even pointing to the granular data element from its source. To make sure you’re not paying for resources, delete and clean up the resources created. In this post, we showed you how Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases supports custom connectors and the ingestion of streaming data, through which developers can add, update, or delete data in their knowledge base through direct API calls. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases offers fully managed, end-to-end RAG workflows to create highly accurate, low-latency, secure, and custom generative AI applications by incorporating contextual information from your company’s data sources. With this capability, you can quickly ingest specific documents from custom data sources without requiring a full sync, and ingest streaming data without the need for intermediary storage.

Title: Damn the tariffs! Full speed ahead on AI!
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/04/18/damn-tariffs-full-speed-ahead-ai/
Time Published: 2025-04-18T14:58:35Z

UPDATED 10:58 EDT / APRIL 18 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Seemingly oblivious to the faltering economy, new artificial intelligence models kept coming fast and furious this week, especially from OpenAI — and apparently they’re pretty popular. China’s DeepSeek? Not so much, at least with the U.S. government, as a House committee just labeled it a security threat. In perhaps a sign that its massive funding is burning a hole in its pocket, OpenAI is also looking at creating a social network. Perhaps Sam Altman sees an opening, given that TikTok still faces having to shut down in the U.S. and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg tried and failed to pay off the FTC to drop its antitrust lawsuit this week, which could force it to unwind its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. But honestly I don’t really get it any more than I get Elon Musk trying to goose Grok by connecting it to X. IPOs surprisingly aren’t quite dead yet, as Figma filed confidentially this week and Kodiak Robotics said it will go public via a SPAC. But with Trump kicking the economy into a ditch, it’s hard to see any kind of IPO revival. Meanwhile, the tariff gyrations caused tech stocks to plunge again Wednesday, and the overall market fell Thursday too. Nvidia is producing its latest-generation Blackwell AI chips in Arizona with TSMC, and it’s building AI supercomputers in Texas with Foxconn and Wistron — both no doubt in the works for years, even if Trump likely will try to take credit. But that won’t help prevent more troubles from tariffs and other trade limitations, as Nvidia faces a $5.5 billion sales hit from limits on shipping its H20 chip to China. AMD also estimates an $800 million charge from U.S. restrictions on China trade, and ASML missed order expectations amid tariff uncertainty. And surely there’s more trouble coming. No wonder Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang just hopped on a plane to China to smooth things over with officials and local customers. Private equity is staying busy as the stock market creates bargains and targets: Elliott Management has bought up $1.5 billion worth of HPE’s stock. Suffice to say, expect some changes ahead for HPE. Meantime, Intel sold 51% of Altera to Silverlake for $3.4 billion, at a valuation of $8.75 billion — a big haircut from its original acquisition price of $16.7 billion. Google lost another antitrust case, this one on its ad tech offering. But Google will appeal and ad tech is 17% of its business, so the previous case declaring Google Search a monopoly, which awaits a judge’s remedies, remains the bigger deal. If government agencies can still work together in this day and age, it’s not a stretch that a deal involving both cases could happen in place of years of further litigation. The critical CVE Program for tracking cybersecurity vulnerabilities got a last-minute funding reprieve, but it never should have come to this. It’s hard not to feel that we’re one more bad decision by the confederacy of clowns away from disaster. Infrastructure is still getting some big fundraises: Hammerspace raised a hefty $100 million for its Linux-powered data management platform. And Auradine nabbed $153 million to develop bitcoin mining and AI networking hardware. Tech earnings season gets underway in earnest next week with SAP, Tesla, IBM, ServiceNow, Check Point Software, Pegasystems, Intel and Alphabet. The results won’t be nearly as interesting as the outlooks, which surely won’t be robust. Here’s all the news this week from SiliconANGLE and beyond, which you can hear and read more about in John Furrier’s and Dave Vellante’s weekly podcast theCUBE Pod, up on YouTube now.

Title: Freshman Rep. Suhas Subramanyam Blasts Data Centers While Cashing In on the Tech Companies That Own Them

He's talking tough on big tech—but banking on their servers. Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, a freshman Democrat who represents Northern Virginia, is sounding the alarm about the large data centers that have cropped up in his district, blasting them as "invasive" pollutants that could attract cyberattacks. Those centers support more than 78,000 jobs in Northern Virginia. And while Subramanyam doesn't want them in his backyard, he owns hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of stock in the companies that own them, records show. Subramanyam is sitting on at least $630,000 worth of stock in companies like Amazon, Meta, and NVIDIA, with holdings potentially in excess of $1 million, according to congressional financial disclosures. The companies own or provide critical support to a lion's share of the Virginia data centers, which help power the internet by storing user data for some of America's largest companies. Subramanyam's district is home to more data centers than any other in the country—but during a recent committee hearing, he portrayed them as a creeping menace. "They seemed like a great idea at the time ... but our community is paying the price now, and we're a cautionary tale for the rest of the country," Subramanyam said, calling the centers "not great for the communities." "[In]the next five years alone, data centers can increase customers bills by up to $276 a year, and people's utility bills may double in the next 7 to 10 years just to power data centers," Subramanyam said. "And the environmental impact is real as well. These green spaces are disappearing. Pollution is rising and water supplies are being stretched thin. It's making reaching our clean energy goals in Virginia nearly impossible." "And it's also a security risk," the congressman continued, warning that Russia or other malign actors would be tempted to target the data center hub which had emerged in his district. "You just look at the Ukraine war. When Russia failed to hack Ukraine’s telecom networks, what did they target? They targeted the data centers." A combination of factors—including tax incentives, an abundance of skilled labor, good climate, and proximity to cable internet infrastructure—has made Northern Virginia an ideal spot for the tech sector's data centers. Should they move elsewhere, Subramanyam's stock portfolio would likely rebound—and the area he represents would lose some $31 billion in economic output, according to the Northern Virginia Technology Council. Subramanyam specifically holds at least $500,000 in NVIDIA and at least $130,000 more in Amazon and Meta, according to his most recent personal financial disclosures. Amazon alone maintains at least 93 data centers in Northern Virginia, according to DataCenters.com, a third-party monitoring website. Meta's data center in Sandston, Va., occupies 450,000 square feet and cost $1 billion, according to the Virginia Economic Development Partnership. And while NVIDIA does not own centers outright, they play an integral role in the data center ecosystem. The company's NVIDIA DGX-Ready Data Center program partners with centers by providing coveted certifications guaranteeing they are optimized to handle the various demands and requirements of their parent companies. Rep. Nick Langworthy (R., N.Y.) sent a message to the companies operating data centers in Subramanyam's district. "We need to focus on keeping America competitive and powering our future," he told the Washington Free Beacon. "If Rep. Subramanyam is too foolish to want these great jobs in his district, bring them to mine!" Subramanyam did not respond to a request for comment.
