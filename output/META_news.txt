UPDATED 06:33 EDT / JULY 19 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill.

That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis.

Title: Treasury Yields Slide After Waller's July Rate Cut Call: Markets Wrap

Bond yields fell as Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller reiterated his case for a July rate cut, while data showed consumer expectations for inflation improved. Stocks wavered amid earnings. President Donald Trump signed the stablecoins bill in a win for the crypto industry. Short-dated Treasuries led gains as Waller hinted he would dissent if his colleagues vote to hold rates steady in July. Bonds also rose as University of Michigan data showed consumers expect prices to increase at an annual rate of 4.4% over the next year, down from 5% in the prior month. The S&P 500 was little changed. The dollar edged lower, but notched an advance for the week. “Investors have something to cheer about with signs of improved inflation expectations,” said Jeff Roach at LPL Financial. “According to this report, the trajectory looks encouraging.” Meantime, Waller said he sees no sign that inflation expectations are on the rise, which allows the Fed to move forward with rate cuts. He also restated the case the Fed should cut when policymakers gather later this month, given data suggesting the US labor market is “on the edge.” “We think he is correct. The Fed’s role is to think ahead, not look behind, which is what Waller is doing concerning the slowing employment situation,” said Andrew Brenner at NatAlliance Securities. “Nonetheless a July cut won’t happen.” Money markets still assign near-zero odds of a cut on July 30. They price in about 45 basis points of easing by year-end, down from more than 65 basis points at the start of the month. US consumer sentiment rose to a five-month high in early July as expectations about the economy continued to improve. The preliminary July sentiment index rose to 61.8 from 60.7 a month earlier, according to University of Michigan data released Friday. The report offered further relief after data this week showed US retail sales rebounded in June in a broad advance, tempering some concerns about a retrenchment in consumer spending. To Mark Hackett at Nationwide, macroeconomic data remains broadly supportive, and the recent strength in markets has been impressive, though perhaps even more noteworthy is the prevailing sense of calm amid a busy and often volatile news cycle. “Investors have responded positively to robust economic indicators and earnings reports that highlight continued resilience in US consumer spending,” he said. “The rest of earnings season will be a key test given elevated valuations and expectations, though with current momentum and sentiment, the path of least resistance is higher.” At Wolfe Research, Chris Senyek says economic data releases this week have been consistent with his view that the US economy is coming in better than consensus expects. “However, we continue to be worried about the risk of inflation remaining stickier than expected in the back half of 2025,” Senyek noted. The stock market’s relatively modest gains this week despite mostly solid economic data and earnings could be a preview for much of the rest of the year, according to Daniel Skelly, head of Morgan Stanley’s Wealth Management Market Research & Strategy Team. “While tariff uncertainty continues, the markets may be learning to live with it, to a certain extent,” he said. “But with a decisive resolution unlikely in the near term and the Fed holding the line on rate cuts, price action at the index level could remain congested.” Trump is readying plans for industry-specific tariffs to kick in alongside his country-by-country duties in two weeks, ramping up his push to reshape the US’s standing in the global trading system by penalizing purchases from abroad. Trump is pushing for a minimum tariff of 15%-20% in any deal with the European Union, the Financial Times reported. Meantime, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated the two nations could reach a “good” trade deal while signaling the process may take more time. “The lack of any clear damage from the tariffs, solid earnings results, a firm job market, and consumers who keep spending are supporting the high valuations,” said Louis Navellier, chief investment officer at Navellier & Associates. The Food and Drug Administration plans to ask Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. to pause shipments of its Elevidys treatment after three deaths were linked to the company’s gene therapies, according to a person familiar with the matter. Humana Inc. lost a lawsuit seeking to reverse cuts to its Medicare bonus payments, a blow for the insurer that had hoped the court would restore billions in revenue. American Express Co.’s expenses grew in the second quarter as the firm made risk-management investments for its affluent consumers, who continued to spend amid economic uncertainty. Netflix Inc. beat expectations for second-quarter results and continues to trounce rival media companies, yet the shares slipped on Friday as investors took a pause after the stock has nearly doubled over the past year. 3M Co. raised its profit forecast and beat Wall Street’s estimates for the second quarter as Chief Executive Officer William Brown’s effort to reinvigorate the company gained momentum. Chevron Corp. has prevailed in a 20-month fight to buy Hess Corp. for $53 billion, overcoming a challenge by arch rival Exxon Mobil Corp. that was unprecedented in the modern history of Big Oil. SLB, the world’s largest oil-services provider, sees resiliency in the industry and remains constructive about the second half of 2025 despite uncertainties in customer demand. Interactive Brokers Group Inc. reported total net interest income for the second quarter that beat the average analyst estimate. Charles Schwab Corp. reported earnings per share that topped estimates as the firm said client assets hit a new record and trading revenue rose. Ally Financial Inc. left most of its forecast unchanged despite strong second-quarter consumer auto-loan originations and earnings. Meta Platforms Inc. said it won’t sign the code of practice for Europe’s new set of laws governing artificial intelligence, calling the guidelines to help companies follow the AI Act overreach.

A billionaire who made his fortune at Tiger Global just poured more than $300 million into a high-growth stock that’s skyrocketed over the last year. Karthik Sarma, who now spearheads SRS Investment Management, sold all of the hedge fund’s massive investment in Nvidia (NVDA) between Q1 of 2024 and Q1 of 2025. Now, new 13F filings show Sarma has piled about $334 million, purchasing 4.74 million shares, into Tapestry (TPR). The luxury goods company, known for its premium handbag and accessories brands like Coach and Kate Spade, has seen its stock surge over 100% in the past 12 months. Tapestry specializes in designing and retailing high-end fashion accessories, leveraging its iconic brands to capture the growing demand for luxury lifestyle products. The company’s strong cash flows and strategic share-repurchase program may have also caught Sarma’s eye, with SRS Investment Management now allocating about 4.5% of the hedge fund’s portfolio to the new investment. That makes Tapestry the fourth-largest allocation at SRS, following Pdd Holdings Inc. at 6.45%, Planet Fitness Inc. at 6.09%, and Meta Platforms Inc. at 5.75%, highlighting a strategic focus on e-commerce, fitness, AI and tech, alongside luxury retail.

("DoubleVerify" or the "Company") (NYSE: DV) investors of a class action representing investors that bought securities between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, inclusive (the "Class Period"). DoubleVerify investors have until July 21, 2025 to file a lead plaintiff motion. Investors are encouraged to contact attorney Lesley F.

CASE ALLEGATIONS: DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. provides media effectiveness platforms that help advertisers optimize digital ad performance. According to the class action lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose material facts, including that:(i) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting ad spending away from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the company’s technological capabilities were limited and faced direct competition from native tools offered by platforms such as Meta and Amazon;(ii) developing DoubleVerify’s technology for these closed platforms was far more costly and time-consuming than represented to investors;(iii) monetization of Activation Services on closed platforms would take several years, contrary to defendants’ suggestions;(iv) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to implement AI solutions on closed platforms, impairing DoubleVerify’s competitiveness and profitability;(v) the company systematically overbilled customers for ad impressions served to known bots operating from data center server farms; and(vi) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially misleading by presenting already occurring issues as hypothetical risks. The lawsuit further alleges a series of corrective disclosures that negatively impacted the company’s stock price: February 28, 2024: DoubleVerify issued lower-than-expected Q1 2024 revenue growth guidance, citing a “slow start by brand advertisers” and slow onboarding of new customers. On this news, the stock dropped over 21%. May 7, 2024: DoubleVerify cut its full-year 2024 revenue outlook, attributing the change to reduced ad spending by customers. The stock declined nearly 39% following this announcement. February 27, 2025: DoubleVerify reported disappointing Q4 2024 earnings and sales, revealing that the shift from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the company.

Title: AI mania is worse than 1999's tech bubble, Apollo's top economist warns

Skip to comments. Posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye A top Wall Street economist is sounding the alarm on sky-high valuations in AI stocks — and drawing comparisons to the tech bubble of the late 1990s. "Yes, AI will do incredible things for all of us," Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. "But does that mean I should be buying tech companies at any valuation?" According to Sløk, the answer is increasingly no. In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. 1 posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

Pluribus Unum Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds. In practice, it is GIGO. Definitely true of public domain use of AI. I can see practical use of AI with certain amounts of datasets constrained to only data that's been verified. Or perhaps use AI for early layers of forensic research, even looking at large public data sets of unverified data, but only with the understanding that eventually the AI research results themselves have to be investigated to be certain. But AI as we often see it used is definitely just GIGO on steroids. 8 posted on 07/18/2025 11:16:13 AM PDT by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 8 | View Replies] To: lasereye Task-specific “AI” can work well, but the idea that anyone is ever going to create some all-knowing infallible digital oracle is pure fantasy. That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

Ferrari has a PE of about 51 and is more profitable than Tesla. Tesla is simply a car maker and ranks globally in the bottom of the pack by number of units but second to Ferrari in profitability per unit. Watch what happens there without the subsidy.

Wrong, and full of FUD. Tesla is much more than a car maker. Heavily invested in AI, robotics, energy creation, etc. Just their energy division may surpass their car profits (they're becoming a power-utility company). Then there is their contributions to research with Musk's other companies, like SpaceX with Starlink and metals research, and AI with NeuraLink. I suggest you do some research into Tesla and their operations. Musk suggested that they won't be focused on selling cars in the future, it will be a side operation for producing RoboTaxis and commercial vehicles. 19 posted on 07/18/2025 11:38:15 AM PDT by roadcat ( ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: TexasGator What? Solar, home power batteries, charge points? All made more attractive if not feasible by incentives. Let’s see how it works out now that those incentives are disappearing. There is not enough blue sky in Tesla for me to ever pay to access a PE of 177. I will eventually put in solar but the payout on batteries just does not float even at higher electricity prices, which I expect to arrive as the net zero falls apart and is replaced in a panic by expedient sources. Excess capacity and reverse metering don’t work either. You can’t pay a low enough cost to make excess capacity payout in a reasonable time. The RoR of that investment is a loser at the rejected cost of power. Your thoughts are your own and you are welcome to them. Maybe one of us will be right. 20 posted on 07/18/2025 11:45:07 AM PDT by Sequoyah101 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 15 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-40, 41-45 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second.

In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

Wrong, and full of FUD. Tesla is much more than a car maker. Heavily invested in AI, robotics, energy creation, etc. Just their energy division may surpass their car profits (they're becoming a power-utility company). Then there is their contributions to research with Musk's other companies, like SpaceX with Starlink and metals research, and AI with NeuraLink. I suggest you do some research into Tesla and their operations. Musk suggested that they won't be focused on selling cars in the future, it will be a side operation for producing RoboTaxis and commercial vehicles. 19 posted on 07/18/2025 11:38:15 AM PDT by roadcat ( ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: TexasGator What? Solar, home power batteries, charge points? All made more attractive if not feasible by incentives. Let’s see how it works out now that those incentives are disappearing. There is not enough blue sky in Tesla for me to ever pay to access a PE of 177. I will eventually put in solar but the payout on batteries just does not float even at higher electricity prices, which I expect to arrive as the net zero falls apart and is replaced in a panic by expedient sources. Excess capacity and reverse metering don’t work either. You can’t pay a low enough cost to make excess capacity payout in a reasonable time. The RoR of that investment is a loser at the rejected cost of power. Your thoughts are your own and you are welcome to them.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak. It may be a good idea to take some profits on any AI related stocks. 1 posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: lasereye Theoretically, AI is the wisdom of crowds.

A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

Title: AI mania is worse than 1999's tech bubble, Apollo's top economist warns

Posted on 07/18/2025 11:02:45 AM PDT by lasereye A top Wall Street economist is sounding the alarm on sky-high valuations in AI stocks — and drawing comparisons to the tech bubble of the late 1990s. "Yes, AI will do incredible things for all of us," Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. "But does that mean I should be buying tech companies at any valuation?" According to Sløk, the answer is increasingly no. In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

"But does that mean I should be buying tech companies at any valuation?" According to Sløk, the answer is increasingly no. In a research note to clients this week, he pointed to internal data showing the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) of the 10 largest companies in the S&P 500 — many of them AI stock picks like Meta and Nvidia — have eclipsed P/E levels seen at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999. That signals a dangerous concentration of investor exposure in just a handful of tech giants, Sløk argued. "Almost 40% of the S&P 500 is made up by the 10 largest companies," he said. "So if I take $100 as an investor and buy the S&P 500, I think I have exposure to 500 different stocks, but I'm really just betting on the Nvidia and the AI story continuing." In his note, Sløk noted that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. His concerns echo a growing unease on Wall Street over how much of the recent stock market rally is driven by AI euphoria and momentum trades. BTIG analysts flagged similar warning signs in a note this week, describing market sentiment as "frothy" and raising the possibility of a near-term pullback in high-flying AI names. Their focus was on the BUZZ NextGen AI Sentiment Index, a benchmark of AI-related stocks popular with retail investors. The index is up 45% over the past 16 weeks.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak.

Or they were on their way to bankruptcy when they were bought by large companies when they were down over 90% from their peak levels. Some of them were just smoke and mirrors, with little or no sales. The high-flying AI startups are not equivalent to those companies, although they may well be overpriced. But some big companies also got way overpriced back then, which is the focus of this analyst. For example Microsoft was at $62 in December 1999. After the bubble popped it didn't get back to that until April 2017. It's around $511 today, which works out to an annual return of around 8.5% if you bought it at the bubble peak.

That foolish belief is an outgrowth of a materialistic worldview. These people don’t believe in God or in the existence of a non-physical soul. They think that human consciousness and the ability to think and ponder comes merely from the physical properties of the brain. That’s what leads them to the blindingly stupid conclusion that if they can simply create a sufficiently sophisticated computer, they can replicate, or surpass, the human ability to think. They even believe that such a computer could become conscious. Total idiocy. Limited, narrowly-focused applications, such as automated navigation, either in the air or on the ground, can work well because those are primarily mechanistic tasks. But computers are not good at those tasks because they’ve somehow obtained the ability to think. They’re good at them, even better than humans at times, because they can use a multitude of sensors to give them better situational awareness, and they can calculate at extremely high speeds. These are tasks that are perfectly suited for what is just a very advanced calculator. But the pipe dream of “general AI” will never work, for among many reasons the fact that these software algorithms make constant errors (because they can’t actually think!), and that the larger they grow the more errors they make and the more difficult (and eventually impossible) it becomes for humans to detect errors and correct them. A sufficiently comprehensive “AI” would be impossible to quality check, because no human or even team of humans would be able to know how and why it made every one of its trillions of decisions per second. Unless we’re just going to create an idiocracy that unquestioningly trusts anything some “AI” algorithm spits out (a very real risk given the current foolish feeding frenzy), I see no long-term place for “general AI.” The very concept is fatally flawed, no matter how advanced the calculation engines that it runs on become. 12 posted on 07/18/2025 11:26:50 AM PDT by noiseman (I The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.)

I will eventually put in solar but the payout on batteries just does not float even at higher electricity prices, which I expect to arrive as the net zero falls apart and is replaced in a panic by expedient sources. Excess capacity and reverse metering don’t work either. You can’t pay a low enough cost to make excess capacity payout in a reasonable time. The RoR of that investment is a loser at the rejected cost of power. Your thoughts are your own and you are welcome to them. Maybe one of us will be right.

July 18, 2025 08:49 ET | Source: Grabar Law Office Grabar Law Office PHILADELPHIA, July 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC): Grabar Law Office is investigating claims on behalf of shareholders of Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC). The investigation concerns whether certain officers and directors breached the fiduciary duties they owed to the company. If you purchased Centene (NYSE: CNC) shares prior to December 12, 2024 and still hold shares today, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/centene-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085 to learn more. You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. WHY? As alleged in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint, Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC) provided investors with material information concerning Centene’s expected revenue guidance and adjusted diluted EPS for fiscal year 2025. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company’s enrollment and morbidity rates, as well as strong retention rates in Centene’s Medicare business. The Complaint alleges that Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Centene’s enrollment and morbidity rates. The Complaint claims that such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Centene’s securities at artificially inflated prices. WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW: If you purchased Centene (NYSE: CNC) shares prior to December 12, 2024 and still hold shares today, you are encouraged to visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/centene-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085. You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. If, alternatively, you purchased your shares between December 12, 2024 and June 30, 2025, you can participate in the class action. $CNC #Centene DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV): If you have held DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV) shares since prior to November 10, 2023, and would like to learn more about the investigation and your rights, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/doubleverify-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call us at 267-507-6085. Why? As alleged in an underlying securities fraud class action complaint, DoubleVerify, via certain of its officers, failed to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the above, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. What You Can Do Now: Current DoubleVerify shareholders who have held DoubleVerify shares since prior to November 10, 2023, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to them whatsoever. If you would like to learn more about this matter, you are encouraged to visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/doubleverify-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. $DV #DoubleVerify Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC) Shareholder Class Action Survives Motion to Dismiss: If you are a Current Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC) shareholder who has held Napco shares since prior to November 7, 2022, you can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. Click here to join or learn more: https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. Why? Key allegations in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint against the company and certain of its officers have survived a motion to dismiss. That complaint alleges that Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC), through certain of its officers and directors, made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Napco failed to address any material weaknesses with internal controls regarding cost of goods sold ("COGS") and inventory; (2) Napco downplayed the severity of material weaknesses regarding their internal controls; (3) Napco’s unaudited financial statements from September 30, 2022 to the present included “certain errors” such as overstating inventory and understanding net COGS, resulting in overstated gross profit, operating income and net income for each period; (4) as a result, Napco would need to restate its previously filed unaudited financial statements for certain periods; and (5) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. On April 11, 2025, the federal court determined that key allegations would survive Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint. In so holding, the court determined “Plaintiffs have adequately stated Exchange Act claims by pleading scienter [knowledge of wrongdoing] through defendants’ unusual stock sales and by plausibly alleging loss causation between the corrective announcement and stock price drop. Plaintiffs have also stated Securities Act claims against Napco and the underwriter defendants.” . . . “Taking the well-pleaded facts as true, there is no question that plaintiffs have adequately pled scienter. First, the stock sales were highly unusual in timing and amount. As to amount, the total proceeds of over $108 million from stock sales by the officer defendants weigh in favor of a motive. . . . And the officer defendants sold hefty percentages of their holdings – 48.5% for Soloway and 45.5% for Buchel.” What To Do Now: If you have held Napco shares since before November 7, 2022 and would like to learn more about this matter, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever. $NSSC #NAPCO Treace Medical Concepts, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMCI) If you have held Treace Medical Concepts (NASDAQ: TMCI) shares continuously since prior to May 8, 2023, you can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the Company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost you. Visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/treace-shareholder-investigation/, or contact Joshua H. Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com or call 267-507-6085 to learn more. Why? A recently filed securities class action complaint alleges that, Treace Medical Concepts, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMCI), via certain of its officers, made materially false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, the Complaint alleges Defendants failed to disclose that: (1) competition impacted the demand for and utilization of its primary product, the Lapiplasty 3D Bunion Correction System; (2) as a result, Treace Medical’s revenue declined, and the Company needed to accelerate its plans to offer a product that served as an alternative to osteotomy (a surgical procedure involving the cutting and realignment of a bone to improve its position or function); and (3) Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. What You Can Do Now: Current Treace shareholders who have held Treace shares since prior to May 8, 2023, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to them whatsoever.

Posted on July 18, 2025 by Nick Roach 2 Comments The Divi 5 Public Alpha is available for use on new websites. If you use Divi 5, you’ll notice an update notification for Public Alpha Version 19. We release new Divi 5 versions every two weeks, and it gets better each time. If you haven’t tested Divi 5 yet, try it and let us know what you think. I didn’t publish a post for Public Alpha 17 and 18, so I’ll cover everything that has changed since then. We implemented 121 bug fixes and improvements, five new features, including Flexbox Layouts, Interactions, Improved Backward Compatibility, Relative Colors, and Find and Replace, and made significant progress on two upcoming features. Regarding bug fixes, almost every team has finished their features and is now focused on fixing bugs in preparation for the upcoming public beta. You can expect bug fixes to ramp up over the next month, with a new focus on testing and fixing migration-related issues. In addition to all the little bug fixes, Public Alpha 19 also comes with a few minor improvements: Of course, these minor improvements don’t include all the big features we introduced, so keep reading to learn about those! We’re moving full speed ahead with feature development. We have seven teams working full-time on Divi 5. Here is what they’re up to. 👇 We finished this feature and released it in Divi 5 Public Alpha 18.2. 🎉 Divi 5’s new Flexbox layout system has arrived. This is no minor update. It reinvents Divi, allowing you to build any layout structure, including responsive layout breakdown, custom module ordering, easy vertical alignment and element positioning, and much more. No stone was left unturned, no option was forgotten—we did it all, and it’s best in class. Give it a try today! We finished this feature and released it in Divi 5 Public Alpha 18.1. 🎉 Interactions is a robust system for creating interactive elements such as popups and toggles, and creative scroll-based and mouse-movement-based effects. It’s not a pop-up builder; it’s an anything builder. Create a trigger, assign an effect, choose a target, and bring your custom interactions to life. Give it a try today! We finished this feature and released it in Divi 5 Public Alpha 18. 🎉 We’ve been testing all the top-selling products in the Divi Marketplace and improving Divi 5’s backward compatibility system so that, when the time comes, everyone will be able to upgrade. With the improved backward compatibility update, legacy modules are now available in the Add Module panel and will function much better than before. Give it a try today! We finished this feature and released it in Divi 5 Public Alpha 17.1. 🎉 Divi’s color revolution has arrived, positioning Divi as the clear leader in color management and advanced color systems. 🎉 Divi’s color picker has been completely redesigned, and it doesn’t get any better. Using HSL, you can create mathematically beautiful, variable-based color systems that are easy to manage, revolutionizing how you manage colors on your websites. Give it a try today! We finished this feature and released it in Divi 5 Public Alpha 17. 🎉 Find and Replace is an impressive efficiency tool for Divi power users that will speed up your workflow and play an essential role in helping old websites adopt Divi 5’s new design systems, such as variables. Right-click on any field to find and replace its value within a given scope. It’s a simple concept, but boy, is it useful, and it’s not something you’ll find in most page builders. 🤩 Give it a try today! We gave a sneak peek at Loop Builder last month, and it’s almost finished. Our goal is to release it next week! The idea behind Divi’s loop builder is simple: loop anything! You can create new post-based content by looping sections, rows, columns, groups, modules, and sub-elements. Our first batch of WooCommerce product modules is almost finished and will be the next feature we release after Loop Builder. Here is a list of all the changes implemented in Public Alpha 17 through Public Alpha 19. It’s important to note that Divi 5 is production-ready for use on new websites today! Due to the scope of the Divi 5 project, we took a non-traditional approach to its release schedule, releasing it in five phases. The ultimate goal is to make Divi 5 as helpful as possible, as soon as possible, to as many people as possible. We are in the Alpha phase, akin to “Divi 5 Lite.” It’s missing a few features, but what’s done is ready to be used. It’s far superior to Divi 4 in almost every way. If you prefer Divi 5, you can use it to build new websites. If an existing website depends on a feature that hasn’t been added to Divi 5, you should continue using Divi 4. WooCommerce modules are the only things missing. Even then, Divi 4’s legacy WooCommerce modules will still work in Divi 5 in backward compatibility mode. We aim to enter beta within ~1.5 months based on our progress; 2-3 weeks to wrap up Loop Builder and Woo Modules, followed by a few weeks of focused bug fixing. There are two things we want to accomplish before entering the beta phase, and the majority of our team is now focused on these tasks: Divi 5 will reach its “final form” before the end of the year, with the ultimate goal of leapfrogging the competition before the year ends. Part of that goal involves aggressively developing new features as part of the feature swap. But don’t forget! Between now and then, you can use Divi 5 whenever it becomes your preferred experience. Instead of rushing to a final release, we’re maintaining both Divi 4 and Divi 5, giving users a choice. Once we’re confident in removing that choice, we’ll make it “official,” and everyone will get the Divi 5 upgrade notification. The Divi 5 Public Alpha is available today. Give it a try, and let us know what you think! If you find a bug, report it to our team, and we’ll fix it. We’ll continue to work aggressively to add new features and address feedback. Stay tuned for a new Divi 5 version every two weeks. Browse hundreds of modules and thousands of layouts. Learn about the new way to manage your Divi assets.

Title: Ads of the Week: Duck boats, Chalamet quirks, milk musicals and ketchup devotion
URL: https://www.thedrum.com/news/2025/07/18/ads-the-week-duck-boats-chalamet-quirks-milk-musicals-and-ketchup-devotion
Time Published: 2025-07-18T03:21:00Z
Full Content:
Advertisement July 18, 2025 | 10 min read Listen to article 4 min When hot dogs steal the show, duck boats double as training films, and Timothée Chalamet shops for cattle feed, you know advertising is having a week. These campaigns prove that wit, weirdness, and well-placed heart can turn everyday products into cultural side characters worth rooting for. 125 Years of The Chesapeake Way / Chesapeake Bank Why it works: It tosses out the usual banking tropes in favor of local charm, employee cameos, and a duck boat to prove community banking doesn’t have to be boring. To celebrate 125 years in business, Chesapeake Bank teamed up with agency Familiar Creatures for a campaign that is part ad, part onboarding film, and fully committed to authenticity. Titled 125 Years of The Chesapeake Way, the centerpiece is a 1:45 minute hero spot filmed aboard a duck boat cruising through small-town Virginia, starring actual employees and local characters. Rather than lean on stock footage or corporate buzzwords, the campaign embraces oddball humor and lo-fi storytelling. With nods to Wes Anderson, the spot doubles as a real onboarding video for new hires, highlighting the bank’s values through crochet references, desk décor, and real-life crab cake stunts. The duck boat driver is the actual owner. The crab cake is a 400-pound beast served to baseball fans in Richmond. From social clips like Is That a Duck Boat? to bite-sized 30- and 15-second cutdowns, the campaign taps into regional pride with a knowing wink. It’s a rare example of a financial brand leading with personality over polish, proving that relatability and local flavor can still break through in a category built on sameness. Why it works: It skips fintech jargon in favor of surreal humor and star power, making people curious about money in a fresh way. Cash App’s newest ad taps into Timothée Chalamet’s signature eccentricity. The actor wanders a store filled with strange produce before selecting a mangelwurzel, an obscure root vegetable often used as animal feed. When he tries to pay, the scene shifts into a generational debate about outdated currencies like salt and cowrie shells. The two-minute spot was developed by Cash App’s in-house team, directed by Aidan Zamiri, and written by Elijah Bynum. It’s airing in theaters ahead of Superman and The Fantastic Four: First Steps, with OOH placements in New York and Los Angeles. A co-designed limited-edition Cash App Card stamp with Chalamet is also on the way. It’s a stylized, offbeat campaign that avoids the usual product pitch and instead makes a cultural statement about how we think and talk about money. Why it works: It turns the daily grind of motherhood into a stage-worthy performance, with milk as the quiet but powerful co-star. MilkPep’s latest campaign, Mom’s Show Must Go On, is a high-energy tribute to moms who juggle snack time, tantrums and living-room dance breaks like pros. Rolled out across TikTok, Netflix, Meta and YouTube, the campaign embraces the humor and mess of parenting while drawing a direct line to milk’s role in keeping moms going. Created by agency Gale, the work casts mothers as lead performers in the everyday theater of home life, with kids as their discerning audience. The creative blends relatable chaos with playful spectacle, making milk feel less like a nutritional box to check and more like a backstage essential. The campaign follows MilkPep’s recent efforts to keep dairy relevant in modern culture, trading nostalgia for emotional honesty and short-form storytelling. It’s a smart shift that connects with parents on a personal level while quietly reinforcing milk’s value. Advertisement Why it works: It turns a safety concern into a simple, actionable idea that empowers parents without talking down to them. Tesco Mobile’s latest campaign addresses a growing gap between generations. As digital slang evolves, nearly half of parents and caregivers admit they struggle to understand the way kids communicate online. To bridge that gap, the brand launched a series of outdoor, radio, and digital ads that decode terms commonly used by young people—some of which may carry more serious meanings than they appear. Created by BBH London, the campaign builds on cultural momentum around online safety, sparked in part by Netflix’s Adolescence, which highlighted how emojis and casual slang can hide risky behavior. The goal is to help parents feel more confident, equipping them to spot red flags and open conversations with their kids. By packaging digital literacy into a clear, creative format, Tesco Mobile positions itself as more than a service provider, it becomes a partner in parenting. It transforms sustainability from a feature into a full-blown creative concept that feels fun, not preachy. To launch its new upcycled ‘Stracciatella Saddle,’ Italian cycling brand Selle Royal leaned into whimsy with a musical stop-motion film that spotlights circular design. Built from discarded saddle materials and foam offcuts, the saddle’s marbled pattern recalls the classic stracciatella gelato—making a virtue of its recycled roots. Created by Milan-based agency Adverteam, the campaign centers on Stracciatella Fella, a frame-by-frame animated film crafted from over 2,000 photographs. Using miniature sets, clay figures, and actual recycled foam fragments, the spot turns reuse into a story of reinvention. The campaign is a smart example of how eco-conscious innovation can be marketed through entertainment rather than education, giving Selle Royal cultural texture and personality in a category that often plays it safe. Advertisement Why it works: It captures a universal truth with humor and clarity: when the food hits just right, nothing else matters. In Lost in Love, Heinz’s latest European campaign, a tennis fan is completely absorbed in his ketchup-covered hot dog, tuning out the match around him as if the world has disappeared. The moment is simple, funny, and instantly relatable. Developed by Wieden+Kennedy and Heinz’s in-house agency The Kitchen, the campaign is rolling out across the UK, Ireland, Netherlands and Italy. It is the first time Heinz has launched a campaign simultaneously across its European markets, with a consistent presence on TV, social and out-of-home. By focusing on one irresistible moment of taste, the work reinforces Heinz's brand promise without overexplaining. It is product-led storytelling with just the right amount of charm. Why it works: It strips away the usual supermarket noise and replaces it with quiet, human moments that feel instantly familiar. In a category packed with price flashes and glossy product shots, Ocado’s Shopping List Stories takes a softer approach. Created by Uncommon Creative Studio, the campaign pairs understated shopping lists with emotionally resonant images, from a blurred photo of a handhold to snapshots of birthdays, breakups, and everything in between. Each list hints at a deeper story. One simply reads: “One tin of Ocado Gold Roast Instant Coffee. Zero words.” It’s minimalist, but it lands with unexpected weight. This outdoor-focused campaign isn’t trying to shout louder than its competitors. Instead, it invites viewers to pause, connect, and remember that behind every grocery order is a life being lived. That shift in tone makes Ocado feel more thoughtful and more human without ever needing to show a price tag. Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) are two medically important causes of respiratory tract infections and diseases. After more than five decades of research and development, vaccines have recently been approved for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV. However, vaccines for hMPV remain in early-stage development. Here we describe the design and characterisation as well as pre-clinical development of a bivalent vaccine, VXB-241, comprised of the recombinantly expressed viral fusion proteins from both RSV and hMPV, stabilised in their pre-fusion conformation by combining the use of two technologies, the second-generation molecular clamp (MC2S) and key pre-fusion stabilizing mutations. Each of the two antigens were produced at high yield in a mammalian expression system and purified by an affinity capture resin specific to MC2S. Each antigen was demonstrated to adopt the pre-fusion conformation, which was stable for at least twelve months in liquid formulation at 2–8°C. Head-to-head evaluation in mouse immunogenicity studies showed that the VXB-241 candidate vaccine induced a neutralising immune response that was superior or equivalent to the pre-fusion stabilised comparator antigens for either RSV or hMPV, including the RSVPreF3 antigen of the licensed RSV vaccine, Arexvy (GSK). The results presented here have supported progression of VXB-241 into a Phase 1 clinical trial which commenced enrolment in August 2024 (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT06556147). A second-generation molecular clamp was used to help lock viral glycoproteins in a stabilised native prefusion conformation to elicit highly protective immunity and to enable consistent manufacture of highly stable, ready-to-use, fully liquid vaccines. The first- and second-generation molecular clamp platforms were previously validated in two successful Phase 1 clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (NCT04495933 and NCT05775887). This work is the first presentation of the pre-clinical development of a multi-pathogen vaccine, VXB-241 targeting both RSV and hMPV. The two antigens (VXB-213 and VXB-221) were shown to be stable for at least 12 months at 2–8°C and are able to elicit a strong neutralising immune response against RSV and hMPV in mouse immunogenicity study. VXB-241 is currently under evaluation in a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT06556147). Citation: Young A, Kolekar S, Mendoza CA, Jaberolansar N, Modhiran N, Webb T, et al.

RSV was discovered in 1956 and causes infections at all ages and is a major cause of severe illness, especially for infants and older adults. There are 2 major antigenic subtypes of human RSV (A and B). By 2 years of age, virtually all children will have been infected with RSV. RSV is the most common cause of respiratory tract infections leading to bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children younger than 1 year of age in the United States. Moreover, the epidemiology of RSV shows high incidence of RSV hospitalisation among older patients as well as high risk for severe disease in immunocompromised adults [1]. Long-term care facility residents are particularly vulnerable to outbreaks and serious illness [2]. RSV burden of severe disease may be comparable to influenza [1]. Since the discovery of hMPV in 2001, the virus has been identified worldwide. Through genetic analysis hMPV has been characterised into 2 groups A and B which are further divided into 4 sub-lineages [3]. hMPV can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages, especially among young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. hMPV is associated with acute lower respiratory infections and can result in bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Overall, the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of hMPV infection are like those in RSV infection [4]. Although nearly all populations will experience primary hMPV infection by age 5, hMPV re-infection occurs throughout adult life. Rates of hospitalisation of children for hMPV infection are highest in the first year of life but occur throughout early childhood. Pre-existing conditions, particularly asthma, play a role in disease severity and hospitalisation [5]. It has been documented that both RSV and hMPV have a high incidence rate and burden of illness, especially amongst susceptible populations including newborns, young children under 5 years of age, older adults, elderly and immunocompromised host. In children under five years of age, RSV infections were estimated to cause per year 33 million acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs), and to be associated to 3.6 million hospitalisations and 100,000 deaths worldwide [6]. Within the paediatric population globally in 2018, hMPV infection was estimated to be the cause per year of 11 million ALRI cases, 502,000 hospitalisations and 11,300 deaths [7]. In older adults over the age of 60, RSV infection is estimated to account for 5.2 million ALRIs, 470,000 hospitalisations and 33,000 deaths in high-income countries alone [8]. Within the older adult population, the burden of disease caused by hMPV has been less intensely studied, however there is an increased availability and implementation of molecular assays in clinical practice to analyse the virus causing lower respiratory tract disease [9]. Recent studies, conducted in the US and several countries worldwide, have shown that RSV and hMPV are similarly related to acute respiratory diseases, with similar reported percentage of virus detection, hospitalisations and deaths in susceptible populations [10]. After more than 5 decades of research and development [11,12], three vaccines have recently been approved in Europe, the USA and elsewhere for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by RSV in older adults: two subunit vaccines, Arexvy (GSK) [13] and Abrysvo (Pfizer) [14], and a mRNA vaccine, MRESVIA (Moderna) [15]. Abrysvo has also received approval for vaccination during pregnancy for the protection of infants against RSV throughout the first six months following birth [16]. Each vaccine has demonstrated high levels of protective efficacy and favourable safety in their respective target populations [13–16]. The transformational discovery at the heart of these advances has been the recognition that during the fusion of the viral envelope to the host cell membrane, glycoprotein F transitions irreversibly from a pre-fusion (RSV preF) to a post-fusion (RSV postF) conformation. RSV preF is an unstable conformation that is able to elicit strong neutralising antibody (nAb) activity while the conformationally more stable RSV postF elicits poor nAb activity [17,18]. While there are no vaccines currently available for hMPV, a bivalent mRNA vaccine developed by Moderna targeting hMPV and parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) has demonstrated potential to boost neutralisation responses in a Phase 1 clinical trial [19]. Moderna is currently conducting further clinical trials of a bivalent mRNA vaccine targeting RSV and hMPV. Icosavax, now part of AstraZeneca, is also developing a bivalent RSV-hMPV vaccine (IVX-A12), based on virus-like particles (VLPs), which has been demonstrated to boost neutralsing antibody titres against both RSV and hMPV by 3–5 fold [20]. As with RSV, the hMPV preF has been demonstrated to elicit a higher neutralising immune response than hMPV postF [21–24], however there are also some differences between the two viruses. For RSV most neutralising immune responses are specific to RSV preF [17,18], however for hMPV neutralising immune responses overlap between hMPV preF and postF [25–27], with some neutralising antibodies (nAbs) recognising epitopes on the internal trimer interface [25,28]. While the newly approved RSV vaccines have great potential to protect vulnerable individuals and reduce the burden on hospitals during peak RSV seasons, equitable distribution of ready-to-use vaccine formulations remains a significant barrier to access these important vaccines, especially within LMICs. Both approved subunit vaccines (Arexvy and Abrysvo) are lyophilised products that require reconstitution prior to administration [13], and MRESVIA, like other mRNA vaccines, is stored frozen and must be thawed prior to administration, cannot be refrozen and must be discarded if not used within 24 hours of thawing [14]. Such requirements complicate real world use. Costly manufacturing and distribution requirements also likely add to the price per dose for these vaccines, impacting global supply and equitable access. A further challenge exists now that three separate respiratory virus vaccines are recommended for elderly populations (seasonal influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and RSV) as vaccination compliance becomes more challenging. The prospect of adding further vaccines to cover and protect against high burden respiratory diseases caused by other viruses such as hMPV and PIV into the current schedule will increase compliance challenges. To address this medical need, multivalent vaccines will be of increased importance and will require developing stable antigens that can be combined in one vaccine. In this work, we describe the development and pre-clinical evaluation of a bivalent candidate vaccine (VXB-241) to provide protection against RSV and hMPV ALRIs. VXB-241 is composed of two antigens: RSV preF (VXB-213) and hMPV preF (VXB-221). The two antigens are stabilised in their pre-fusion conformation by combining the use of two technologies, the proprietary second-generation, immuno-silenced, molecular clamp (MC2S) platform, which enables trimerisation and purification, and key pre-fusion stabilising mutations. The two candidate vaccine antigens show high production yield, liquid stability and the ability to elicit a strong neutralising immune response against RSV and hMPV. A first-in-human, Phase 1 clinical trial is currently underway with the key objective being the assessment of safety and immunogenicity of VXB-241 in healthy adults, 18–40 and 60–83 years of age (clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT06556147). Following the finding in late 2020 that the immune response induced by a first-generation molecular clamp (MC)-stabilised SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, Sclamp, interfered with some HIV diagnostic tests [29], the original MC platform was re-engineered to avoid the use of sequences derived from HIV-1 gp41. A panel of candidate heptad repeat sequences was screened to identify those that form highly stable 6HB structures. Subsequent rounds of optimisation and testing led to the identification of molecular clamp 2 (MC2); details available WO2023187743. As HIV-1 gp41 derived sequences are not included in MC2, cross-reactivity to HIV diagnostics was not anticipated. However, given the similarities in quaternary structure, to rule this out an ELISA was conducted using two different reference serum samples readily available for HIV diagnostic testing. Testing via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that both NIBSC HIV reference serum and BioRad Geenius HIV+ control serum revealed reactivity to MC but no detectable reactivity to MC2 (S1 Fig). Both MC and MC2 were compared, and tested with three different viral antigens that had been validated on the first-generation platform (antigen from SARS-CoV-2 [29], Nipah virus [30], influenza A virus [31]), as well as an early iteration of the RSV preF antigen that was in development. For the four antigens; comparable antigen homogeneity and oligomeric characteristics were conferred by MC and MC2, as demonstrated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (S2 Fig). Immunogenicity in mice was also compared, with sera from mice vaccinated with MC2 and MC2S stabilised antigens shown to elicit equivalent or superior levels of neutralising immune responses compared to MC (S3 Fig). The second-generation clamp was further developed to incorporate additional N-linked glycosylation sites to dampen immunogenicity, referred to as Molecular Clamp 2 Silenced (MC2S). RSV preF incorporating MC2S was compared to MC and MC2, with antigen homogeneity again shown to be comparable and superior neutralising immune responses elicited in mice compared to MC (S2 and S3 Figs). The effect of silencing was demonstrated by comparing the immune response in mice after vaccination with RSV F antigen containing either MC, MC2 or MC2S. The relative percentage of elicited IgG binding to MC2S was reduced by >2-fold from a geometric mean of 34.3% for MC2 to 15.8% for MC2S (S4 Fig). To further determine whether there was any cross-reactivity to HIV gp41, sera from mouse vaccinated with either MC or MC2 stabilised SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was analysed by ELISA against HIV gp41. The MC2 stabilised spike elicited approximately 38-fold lower cross-reactivity compared to MC, essentially at, or near the LoD of the assay (S5 Fig). The RSV and hMPV candidate vaccine antigens including MC2S were generated and analysed side by side with well characterised recombinant protein controls for comparison. Briefly, there were two categories of controls, controls that were classed as non-stabilised soluble controls (RSV Fsol and hMPV Fsol), and controls that were preF stabilised benchmark comparators with a foldon trimerisation domain (RSV DsCav1 [32], hMPV DsCavEs2 [21] and hMPV v3B-Δ12_D454C-V458C [23]). From the new candidate vaccine antigens containing MC2S, one antigen has been selected for RSV, RSV preF, called VXB-213 and another for hMPV, hMPV preF, called VXB-221. VXB-213 was engineered to include the optimal disulfide bridge linkages and furin cleavage site deletion identified by McLellan et al., [32] and Joyce et al., [33], whereas VXB-221 included an unmodified TMPRSS2 cleavage site, a proline substitution and a single disulfide bridge [21,34]. The nomenclature with brief description of each antigen is summarised in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1013312.t001 At a research laboratory scale for antigen discovery purposes, the recombinant antigens were expressed as secretable proteins in mammalian suspension culture (Chinese hamster ovary cells, ExpiCHO-S, Thermofisher) and purified from clarified supernatants by immunoaffinity chromatography using either a ligand-resin with affinity for MC2S (AVI-8740) or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the viral ectodomain. They were buffer exchanged into PBS and characterised by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Superdex Increase 10 300 GL (Cytiva) SEC column (Fig 1). Both the RSV and hMPV antigen panels showed similar trends for their oligomerisation profiles, with the non-stabilised Fsol proteins producing the greatest proportion of aggregate (RSV Fsol, 94% aggregate, 0% trimer; hMPV Fsol, 25% aggregate, 19% trimer, 56% monomer), the MC2S-incorporating antigens showing high degrees of trimer homogeneity (>89% trimer for both VXB-213 and VXB-221) with the comparator antigens being intermediate to these two (RSV DSCav1, 69% trimer; hMPV DSCavEs2, 54% trimer). hMPV DsCavEs2 produced two overlapping peaks within the trimeric fractions, suggesting that the trimer may adopt distinct conformational or oligomeric states. This observation differs from the results reported by Hsieh et al., [22], where hMPV DSCavEs2 was expressed in Freestyle 293-F cells, in the presence of co-transfected Furin and an additional SEC purification step. Similarly, we cannot exclude the possibility that RSV DSCav1 produced here in expiCHO-S (Thermofisher), may be conformationally different to that produced by McLellan et al., in HEK293K cells [32].

For the RSV antigens, ELISAs were performed in a sandwich format with antigens captured using a reformatted murine IgG2 isotype of Motavizumab [35] and probed with preF-specific human-type mAbs D25 [36], MPE8 [37] and AM14 [38]. For VXB-213 (Vicebio RSV preF) and the DsCav1 comparator, sub-nanomolar dissociation constants (KD) for all three mAbs were observed (Fig 1G). AM14 binds a preF, quaternary epitope and its binding to vaccine antigens has been correlated with protective immunity [38]. This mAb showed poor reactivity to the non-stabilised Fsol antigen, while binding VXB-213 with 8 picomolar KD; a 6-fold higher avidity relative to DsCav1. For the hMPV antigens, a broader panel of mAbs targeting diverse epitopes across the topology of preF was tested against the antigen series in an indirect ELISA format (Fig 1H). VXB-221 (Vicebio hMPV preF) was shown to be recognised with sub-nanomolar binding to five of the six mAbs tested. Only DS7 [39], which binds to the post-fusion conformation or a pre/post intermediate, showed low affinity for VXB-221. Neutralising antibodies with moderate or strong pre-fusion preference (MPV467, MPV-487 and MPE8) [37,40], showed similar sub-nanomolar affinities for VXB-221 and comparator antigens DSCavEs2 and v3B-Δ12_D454C-V458C, but poor reactivity for hMPV Fsol. Neutralising antibodies known to recognise the internal trimer interface (MPV-458 and M8C10) [25,40], were able to bind with sub-nanomolar affinity to MPV-Fsol, DSCavEs2 and VXB-221 but showed poor affinity for v3B-Δ12_D454C-V458C, which contains an interprotomer disulphide bridge and has been optimised to adopt a closed, pre-fusion conformation [23]. Further analysis of the antigens by SDS-PAGE showed that the VXB-213 and VXB-221 were both highly pure and homogenous bands of predicted size for the non-cleaved products (S6 Fig). RSV Fsol and DsCav1 controls both showed a major band at the appropriate size for the furin cleaved product. hMPV Fsol showed a major band consistent with the non-cleaved product, DsCavEs2 also showed the presence of two major bands consistent with partial furin cleavage. All four controls exhibited some smearing that could be due to either impurities or proteolytic degradation. The ability of each antigen to deplete neutralising antibodies from a pooled human plasma sample was compared either by directly pre-incubating plasma with antigens in solution or with immobilised antigens coupled to CNBR Activated Sepharose (Invitrogen). Consistent with previous reports [17,18], RSV Fsol performed poorly at removing neutralising antibodies from human plasma, whereas both DSCav1 and VXB-213, were highly efficient at depleting neutralising antibodies (S7A Fig). DSCavEs2 and VXB-221 were also both able to efficiently deplete hMPV neutralising antibodies, although hMPV Fsol was not tested (S7B Fig). BALB/c mice were immunised with 2 µg of the recombinant antigens by intramuscular injection (IM) in 2 doses, 3 weeks apart, with a squalene-based oil-in-water adjuvant, AddaVax (InvivoGen). To ensure RSV and hMPV Fsol antigens were fully in the post-fusion state they were first heated to 70°C for 2 hrs. At completion, analysis of mouse sera by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) indicated that the immunisations had been effective in inducing IgG against each respective antigen. The bivalent candidate vaccine, VXB-241 (a combination of VXB-213 and VXB-221), elicited a response to both the RSV preF and hMPV preF antigens (Fig 2A). Each antigen also elicited a response to the trimer stabilising domain that was detectable via ELISA with a non-homologous antigen (Nipah F) stabilised with either foldon or MC2S. By comparing EC50 values for total antigen-specific IgG and tag-specific IgG for each mouse we were able to estimate the proportion of tag-specific response. This response was considered undesirable as it will not contribute to protection. For VXB-213 and VXB-221 the geometric mean of the relative response to MC2S was found to be 9.3% and 6.3%, respectively, while with the bivalent VXB-241 the relative response to MC2S was found to be 4.7% (Fig 2B). In comparison, for the RSV F DSCav1 the geometric mean of the relative response to foldon was found to be 19.9%. For the hMPV F DSCavEs2 comparator, which also contains foldon, the geometric mean (GM) of the relative response to foldon was 3.1%. This response was somewhat variable with very low titres for 5 individual mice and relatively high titres for the remaining 3 mice.

This analysis demonstrates that VXB-213, at a dose of 2 µg delivered twice, 3 weeks apart, induces a neutralising immune response to RSV A2 (GM = 489; 95%CI = 222–1208). The response to VXB-213 is equivalent to comparator antigen RSV F DSCav1 (GM = 475; 95%CI = 255–946), and approximately 10-fold higher to heat-treated RSV Fsol (GM = 59; 95%CI = 32–125). The analysis of neutralisation against hMPV (Strain CAN97–83) demonstrates that VXB-221 induces a neutralising immune response to hMPV (GM = 1384; 95%CI = 1094–1762). The neutralising immune response elicited by VXB-221 was 2.5-fold higher than comparator antigen hMPV F DSCavEs2 (GM = 558; 95%CI = 336–971) and approximately 5.5-fold higher to heat-treated hMPV Fsol (GM = 252; 95%CI = 99–778). Statistical comparison of the neutralising immune response elicited by VXB-221 to comparator hMPV F DSCavEs2 showed a highly significant difference (Mann Whittney Test; p = 0.0003). The combined VXB-213 and VXB-221 (the selected RSV preF and hMPV preF) antigens mixed prior to injection in mouse, elicited a strong neutralising immune response against both RSV A2 (GM = 329; 95%CI = 171–687) and hMPV (Strain CAN97–83) (GM = 755; 95%CI = 543–1069). A larger scale 50L manufacturing scale production run was performed with the resulting antigens analysed and data compared. For this 50L scale production, stably transfected pools were generated for each antigen. High expression clonal cell lines for VXB-213 and VXB-221 were isolated from CHO K1 stable cell pools and a top clone was selected for production of two specific clonal cell banks. For each antigen an initial production batch was completed at 50L scale to generate material for use in the currently described mouse immunogenicity studies. Production of VXB-213 yielded 1.7 g/L and production of VXB-221 yielded 5.5g/L respectively compared to laboratory scale transient production using the ExpiCHO-S (Thermofisher). This corresponds to production level increases of 70- and 300-fold for VXB-213 and VXB-221, respectively. To assess antigen stability in a liquid formulation over time, a panel of assays was developed. This panel included monitoring for proteolytic degradation by Capillary Electrophoresis under reducing and denaturing conditions (CE-SDS), monitoring for the stability of the soluble trimer by Size Exclusion High Performance Liquid Chromatography (SE-HPLC) and use of a capture ELISA based potency test for each antigen. For VXB-213 (RSV preF), the ELISA included the mAbs Motavizumab [41] to capture and AM14 [38] to probe and for VXB-221 (hMPV preF), DS7 [39] to capture and MPE8 [37] to probe. Stability assessment conducted over twelve months with VXB-213 and VXB-221, showed that both antigens retain >99% single product by CE-SDS, > 90% soluble trimer by SE-HPLC and no decrease in reactivity by Potency ELISA (S8 Fig). Material from the RSV preF (VXB-213) 50L batch was biochemically tested by SDS-PAGE alongside the current Arexvy (GSK) and Abrysvo (Pfizer) antigens. As these comparator antigens are distributed as a lyophilised powder, they were first reconstituted in PBS containing 0.05% PS80. Under reducing conditions, the VXB-213 and VXB-241 samples were highly pure with >95% product forming a single band at 60–70 kDa (S7 Fig). Both the Arexvy and Abrysvo antigens produced a major band between the 37 and 50 kDa markers with faint smearing of larger molecular weight products, and a secondary band slightly larger than 20 kDa. This appears to be consistent with near complete furin cleavage of the antigens. In addition to the above, the antigens manufactured at the 50L bioreactor scale were similarly tested for the induction of immunogenicity and neutralisation responses using BALB/c mice. This study involved two immunisations of either 0.5 µg or 3 µg of each antigen (RSVpreF3 from GSK’s RSV vaccine Arexvy, VXB-213, and VXB-221), or with either 1 µg or 6 µg of the combined VXB-213 and VXB-221 mixed prior mouse injection, called here VXB-241. Two doses were given, 3 weeks apart, all adjuvanted with AddaVax (Invitrogen). Three weeks after the second dose, serum was collected and assayed by ELISA to determine total IgG against each antigen, and the ‘tag-specific’ reactivity using an antigen containing either the MC2S domain or the foldon domain with a heterologous ectodomain (Fig 3A). For VXB-213, VXB-221 and bivalent VXB-241, the geometric mean of the relative response to MC2S for each group ranged between 3.7 and 11.2% (Fig 3B). In comparison, for the Arexvy RSVPreF3 antigen the geometric mean of the relative response to foldon was around twice as high at 15.5 and 15.4%.

At the lower dose level of 0.5 µg of RSV antigen, monovalent VXB-213 and bivalent VXB-241 both stimulated a strong neutralising immune response to RSV A2 (GM = 5,272; 95%CI = 2,884–10,046 and geomean = 8,453; 95%CI = 4,966–14,894, respectively), which was approximately 6- and 10-fold higher relative to the dose-matched Arexvy antigen (GM = 817; 95%CI = 420–1,710). At the higher dose level of 3 µg of the RSV antigen, monovalent VXB-213 and bivalent VXB-241 also stimulated a strong neutralising immune response to RSV A2 (GM = 6,124; 95%CI = 4,375–8,690 and geomean = 7,534; 95%CI = 5,082–8,690, respectively), which was approximately 2- and 2.5-fold higher relative to the dose matched Arexvy antigen (GM = 2,958; 95%CI = 1,361–6,982). Statistical comparison of the neutralising immune response elicited by VXB-213 to the response elicited by the Arexvy antigen showed a significant difference at the 0.5 µg dose level (Mann Whittney Test; p = 0.003) but not at the higher dose level of 3 µg (Mann Whittney Test; p = 0.13). The equivalent analysis of neutralisation against hMPV preF (Strain CAN97–83) is shown in Fig 3D. At the lower dose level of 0.5 µg of hMPV preF antigen, monovalent VXB-221 stimulated a strong neutralising immune response (GM = 1,074; 95%CI = 818 - 1,426), however the neutralising immune response was approximately 5-fold lower for the bivalent VXB-241 (GM = 185; 95%CI = 98–380), potentially indicating some interference due to immunodominance of the RSV preF antigen. At the higher dose level of 3 µg of hMPV antigen, both monovalent VXB-221 and bivalent VXB-241 stimulated a strong neutralising immune response (geomean = 721; 95%CI = 339 - 1,694 and geomean = 519; 95%CI = 235 - 1,288, respectively). Historically, broadly applicable platform technologies for vaccines have saved countless lives. Such platform technologies have included bacterial polysaccharide vaccines (Meningococcus, Streptococcus, Hemophilus) [42], chemical inactivation of viruses (polio, influenza, rabies, Hepatitis A) and viral attenuation (Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Yellow Fever, Varicella) [43]. While successful, the application of these technologies to new targets often took upwards of 5- > 20 years. In recent years, a variety of platform technologies have been established that have significantly streamlined vaccine development and manufacturing. This is most clear in the mRNA vaccine revolution that has been brought forward in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic [44]. As there are still several challenges linked to the mRNA vaccines field (high reactogenicity, poor longevity, requirement for frozen storage) [44], having a broader variety of established vaccine platforms that are based on different approaches remains valuable. Here, we have demonstrated that vaccine antigens produced with the Molecular Clamp (MC) platform offer key advantages such as liquid stability and improved immune responses. The MC platform provides the versatility to target diverse viral pathogens. The MC platform is essentially a high stability trimerization domain, similar to previously utilised alternatives GCN4 and Foldon [45,46]. The broadly applicable potential of a first-generation Molecular Clamp based on the HIV-1 gp41 6HB domain was demonstrated in preclinical studies for several viruses such as influenza, Ebola, Nipah, Lassa, and MERS coronavirus [30,31]. In 2020 a SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccine progressed through Phase 1 clinical trial, with demonstrated safety and good immunogenicity profiles, but was not progressed due to interference with some HIV diagnostic tests, generating false positives [29]. A re-engineered, non-HIV antigen based MC2S sequence, provides the same candidate vaccine attributes, but overcomes the hurdle that prevented progression of MC. The MC2S platform provides high production yield and purity with a universal purification system (AVI-8740 affinity resin), which facilitates rapid advancement through pre-clinical development. For two viral targets (RSV preF and hMPV preF) transient expression yields of 10 – 30 mg/L were achieved with purity above 95% by SDS-PAGE and approximately 90% homogenous trimer by SEC. This level of production comfortably accommodates pre-clinical testing, including in vitro assessment and animal immunisation studies. Furthermore, transition to 50L scale manufacture uses a comparable process regardless of antigen and was able to increase yields to >1 g/L. Production yields such as this with a consistent manufacturing process have the potential to dramatically reduce investment required to achieve commercial scale vaccine production. Following the approval of a first generation of RSV vaccines, Arexvy (GSK) [13], Abrysvo (Pfizer) [14,16], MRESVIA (Moderna) [15], a large unmet medical need remains with the combined burden of other severe respiratory tract infections amongst highly susceptible populations including newborns, children under 5 years of age, older adult elderly and the immunocompromised. Moreover, there are areas in which the currently approved RSV vaccines can be improved. The two subunit vaccines (Arexvy and Abrysvo) are lyophilised products that require reconstitution prior to administration [13], and the LNP/mRNA vaccine (MRESVIA) is stored frozen and must be thawed prior to administration [14]. All three current RSV vaccines must be discarded if not used within a defined short period of time. In comparison, our current data show that the MC2S incorporating RSV antigen VXB-213, as well as VXB221 (hMPV preF), are both stable in liquid form at 2–8 °C for > 12 months. This finding supports compatibility with prefilled syringes at 2–8°C. The approved RSV vaccines have been demonstrated to have good protective efficacy, which extends over seasons, however the dose level administered to achieve this protective efficacy is relatively high at 120 µg per dose. This is substantially higher than the 15 µg of hemagglutinin (HA) per strain included in standard dose influenza vaccines, and higher even than the 60 µg HA per strain included in high dose formulations [47]. We have shown in a dose and adjuvant matched naïve mouse immunogenicity study that VXB-213 elicited a significantly higher neutralising immune response than the Arexvy RSVpreF3 antigen at the lowest dose levels tested (p = 0.003), likely indicating better presentation of neutralising epitopes to naïve memory B-cells. This result is consistent with previous findings where a fully optimised RSV preF antigen which included the same pair of disulfide bridge stabilisations and optimal deletion within the furin cleavage site was shown to elicit strong neutralisating antibody responses relative to the original RSV preF DsCav1 antigen [33]. VXB-213 incorporates the same ectodomain modifications that are present in this optimised RSV preF antigen. A further complexity exists now that three separate respiratory virus vaccines are recommended for elderly populations (for seasonal influenza virus, COVID-19 and RSV). hMPV is another high burden respiratory virus with a comparable incidence rate and severity to RSV in the older adult population [10]. The prospect of adding further vaccines into the annual schedule is a challenge and would likely impact coverage. We have focused on developing liquid stable antigens for both RSV and hMPV to be combined in a bivalent vaccine to reduce burden on healthcare providers and individuals. While there are currently no approved vaccines for hMPV, there have been a wealth of pre-fusion stabilised antigens produced based on the learnings from RSV [21–24]. We chose two of these, DSCavEs2 [21] and v3B-Δ12_D454C-V458C [23], to include as comparators for in vitro analysis. Consistent with expectations, prefusion specific nAbs were able to bind with similar affinity to VXB-221 and comparator antigens, while nAbs recognising the internal trimer interface bound to VXB-221 and DSCavEs2 but not the closed pre-fusion stabilised antigen v3B-Δ12_D454C-V458C. DSCavEs2 was then included as a positive control within a dose and adjuvant matched naïve mouse immunogenicity study. Here, VXB-221 elicited a significantly higher neutralising immune response relative to HMPV preF DSCavEs2 (p = 0.0003), however it should be noted that differences in purification methodologies used here and those used by Hseih et al., [22] may have contributed to this difference. The 2.5-fold improvement in elicited neutralising immune response was unexpected given that DSCavEs2 has been highly optimised for stability of the pre-fusion conformation. Monoclonal antibody avidity to VXB-221 and DSCavEs2 also appeared to be relatively similar, except for neutralising mAb DS7 which recognises an epitope shared between the pre- and post-fusion conformations. A potential explanation for the improved neutralising immune response may relate to DSCavEs2 being optimised for efficient cleavage at the F1/F2 cleavage site [21], whereas VXB-221 is non-cleaved. It has previously been suggested that F1/F2 cleavage assists in the formation of a stable closed trimer, which was assumed, based on the earlier results for RSV preF would be the optimal antigen for stimulating a neutralizing immune response [23,24]. While nAbs recognising the internal trimer interface bound with similar affinity to both VXB-221 and DSCavEs2, accessibility to the trimer interface may be different in the context of vaccination. Alternatively, there may be additional neutralising epitopes that are specific to the non-cleaved hMPV preF. Of note, proteolytic cleavage of hMPV preF is inefficient relative to RSV preF [48,49], and timing of cleavage within the viral life cycle has not been well characterised. Contrary to structure-based antigen design focusing on the closed and/or fully cleaved hMPV preF which have included multiple structure stabilising mutations [21–24], VXB-221 is expected to adopt an open and non-cleaved preF conformation. This conformation allows for broad display of neutralising epitopes with minimal modification away from the native sequence. However, we note that monoclonal antibodies targeting the internal interface of the hMPV F protein exhibit varying levels of neutralizing potency. While some, such as M8C10 and MPV465, show modest neutralizing activity, others like MPV-458 demonstrate both high neutralizing potency and cross-reactivity across hMPV strains, highlighting the potential importance of this conserved epitope for vaccine design [28,50]. In mice that were vaccinated with the bivalent vaccine VXB-241, we observed some reduction in the neutralising immune response to both RSV and hMPV relative to the monovalent vaccines. This effect was particularly evident at the lowest dosage tested, where the neutralising response to hMPV was reduced by 5-fold; this was not seen for RSV. This finding is consistent with the immunodominance of RSV F relative to hMPV F, however it is unknown whether this same phenomenon will be observed in human clinical trials. As with the MC2S platform, approved RSV subunit vaccines, Arexvy (GSK) and Abrysvo (Pfizer) both include a preF stabilising trimerisation domain [13,14]. The trimer stabilising domain present in Arexvy and Abrysvo RSV preF antigen, is the T4 fibritin sequence-foldon based and the same foldon is also included in RSV preF DSCav1 and hMPV preF DSCavEs2 antigens [21,32]. It has recently been reported that foldon can stimulate an ‘off-target response’ in human vaccine recipients that may negatively impact vaccine potency after repeated administrations [51]. It was recently demonstrated that further stabilisation of the RSV preF ectodomain can facilitate the omission of a trimerization domain thereby eliminating any off-target immune response from this domain [51]. We also recognized the importance of reducing the off-target immune response and achieved this through the incorporation of multiple N-linked glycosylation sites into MC2S. This strategy provides the benefit of easy purification process without drawback of off target response. For each naive mouse immunogenicity study, we calculated the fraction of vaccine elicited IgG that was directed to the T4 fibritin based-foldon or the MC2S trimer stabilising domain, by directly coating antigen to ELISA plates. It should however be noted that direct coating can cause antigen denaturation and so such results may underestimate antigen specific or domain specific IgG responses. Nevertheless we found that typically 10–30% of IgG elicited to foldon containing antigens was specific to the foldon sequence, and therefore unable to contribute to virus neutralisation. This was highly variable and sometimes constituted 40–50% of the elicited IgG response. In comparison, the fraction of IgG directed to the MC2S domain was typically below 10% of the elicited IgG response. Even when mice were immunised with the bivalent VXB-241, in which both antigens contained an identical MC2S domain (with different ectodomains), there was very little overall IgG directed to MC2S. In an ongoing clinical trial by Vicebio, we are exploring the comparative immune responses against the trimerisation domains of both the MC2S containing candidate antigens, and Arexvy as an active comparator (NCT0655614). In summary, the candidate vaccine antigens developed for RSV and hMPV using the second-generation, immuno-silenced, molecular clamp platform show high production yield, high liquid stability, and the ability to elicit a strong neutralising immune response against RSV and hMPV. A first-in-human, Phase 1 clinical trial is currently underway to assess safety and immunogenicity of VXB-241 in healthy adults, 18–40 and 60–83 years of age (clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT06556147). The molecular clamp platform technology contributes to the stabilisation of the antigens and offers the potential to advance the development of safe and effective vaccines for prevention of multiple medically important viral diseases. A subunit vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 generated with the non-immunosilenced, MC2 sequence, recently completed Phase 1 trial testing (clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT05775887) further demonstrating the broad applicability of the proprietary platform. The high yield and consistent production process of MC2S containing candidate vaccine antigens together with the focus on creating liquid stable, multivalent formulations, has the potential to maximise global distribution, improve vaccine compliance, and protect vulnerable populations from medically important respiratory viral diseases. All animal work related to this study was performed in accordance with policies for the proper use and care of animals set by The University of Queensland Animal Ethics Committee (AEC numbers: 2021/AE000123, 2021/AE000183, 2021/AE000571, 2023/AE000539). Experiments were designed to minimise animal numbers, and all animals were housed in suitable facilities with ad libitum access to food, water and environmental enrichment. All procedures were performed under anaesthesia by isoflurane inhalation by properly trained personnel. At the completion of the study, mice were euthanised by CO2 asphyxiation. Vaccine antigen coding sequences codon optimised for Cricetulus griseus and synthetic DNA was synthesised in vitro as gblocks (IDT). Antigen coding sequences were cloned into mammalian expression vector pXC-17.4 (Lonza Group, Basel Switzerland) by In-Fusion Cloning (Clontech). The resulting plasmids were transformed into Stellar Competent Cells (Takara Bio) and screened for correct insertions by colony PCR. Plasmids from selected colonies were isolated and DNA sequencing was conducted to confirm sequence fidelity. Recombinant proteins were expressed transiently in ExpiCHO-S culture (ThermoFisher) using manufacturer’s instructions. RSV and hMPV antigens were purified from cell culture supernatant by affinity chromatography using either an affinity column coupled with monoclonal antibody 101F [52] or resin specific to the clamp domain (AVI8740, Avitide, Repligen). Additional antigens were purified by affinity chromatography with either MC (HIV-1 gp41) specific antibody, HIV1281 [53], SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody CR3022 [54], Nipah F virus specific antibody mab66 [55], or influenza H1 virus specific antibody 5J8 [56]. Immunoaffinity columns were prepared by chemical coupling of mAbs to NHS-Activated Sepharose Resing (Cytiva) using manufacturer’s instructions. Antigens were purified using high pH elution from immunoaffinity resin as previously described [30,31]. Affinity purification of MC2S containing antigens was conducted by pre-equilibrating resin with 50mM Tris, 150mM NaCl, pH 7.4. The column was then washed with 50mM Tris, 600mM NaCl, pH 7.4 and eluted in 50mM Tris, 1M MgCl2, pH7.4, before then being buffer exchanged into PBS pH 7.4. Homogeneity of purified proteins was analysed using SDS-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography. Panels of antibodies specific to RSV and MPV F proteins were generated by cloning the antibody variable domains into mab-xpress vectors by previously described methods [57]. The genetic constructs were expressed in CHO-S mammalian culture and purified using a MabSelect Sure affinity column (Cytiva). The variable domain sequences for 101F [52], D25 [36], MPE8 [37], AM14 [38], DS7 [39], MPV458, MPV483, MPV467, MPV487 [40], M8C10 [25], CR3022 [54], mab66 [55], and 5J8 [56] were obtained from public databases. Purified proteins were characterised by standard ELISA using a panel of mAbs described above. Briefly, for RSV antigens ELISA 96-well Maxisorp plates (ThermoFisher) were coated with 2 µg/mL of mouse isotype Motavizumab (ref). Plates were blocked with blocking solution (PBS supplemented with 5% milk diluent (KPL, SeraCare)). Commercially acquired Arexvy (GSK) or Abrysvo (Pfizer) antigens were resuspended in PBS containing 0.05% PS80 and gently mixed to dissolve. Antigens were added to plates coated with capture antibody at 2 µg/mL in blocking buffer and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. After washing with PBS-T, these plates were then probed with a serial dilution of the stated monoclonal antibody, starting at 33.33 nM and serially diluted 5-fold in blocking solution. After incubating for another hour at 37°C plates were washed as above and bound mAb was detected using goat anti human HRP (ThermoFisher) diluted 1:2000 in blocking buffer. TMB substrate was added and incubated at RT for 3 minutes 30 seconds before the reaction was stopped with 1M H2SO4. Absorbances were then read at 450 nm. Background absorbances of the full reaction without primary mAb were averaged and subtracted from the respective test absorbance readings. Antigen oligomerisation profiles in solution were assessed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL resin filtration column (Cytiva). Antigens (40 ug) were applied using a 500 ul sample loop. 50L batches of VXB-213 and VXB-221 were produced using each of the CHO K1 clonal cell lines to produce material for use in a human Phase 1 clinical trial. Briefly, cells were expanded in shake flasks and then a Rocking Motion Bioreactor (Sartorius), before inoculation into 50L HyPerforma Single-Use Bioreactors (ThermoScientific). Production batches were maintained for 14 days with an optimised feed strategy and standard monitoring for growth rate, viable cell density, pH, osmolarity, glucose level, lactate level, ammonia level and carbon dioxide level After the 14-day production run, cell culture supernatant was harvested by two-stage depth filtration and purified by AVI-8740 resin affinity capture, two ion exchange/mix mode column purification steps, viral inactivation with TNBP/PS80, viral nanofiltration and tangential flow filtration (TFF) into the final formulation buffer. Mouse immunisation studies were conducted using female BALB/c mice 6–8 weeks of age, housed at the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN) Animal Facility in the University of Queensland, Australia. Mice were immunised with 0.5 µg, 2 µg or 3 µg per recombinant protein antigen stated (maximum dose 6 µg for bivalent group) with squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant, AddaVax (InvivoGen). Immediately prior to mouse vaccination, the Arexvy antigen vial was resuspended in PBS containing 0.05% PS80 and then mixed with AddaVax (InvivoGen). Each group (n = 8) was bled via the caudal vein 1 day prior to receiving the first dose (day -1). They were then immunised IM on day 0 and again on day 21 (3 weeks). On day 42 (6 weeks), animals were euthanised and blood was taken by cardiac puncture. The blood was allowed to coagulate overnight at 4°C before centrifugation to isolate the serum. Serum was heat inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes for use in immunological assays. Mouse IgG titres were determined by standard ELISA as described above with the following deviations. Antigens were coated directly on the ELISA plates at 2 µg/mL and probed with a 1/20 initial dilution of mouse serum that was serially diluted 5-fold in blocking solution. Following incubation and washing, the bound serum was detected using goat anti mouse HRP (ThermoFisher) at 1:2,000 dilution, before detection and reading as stated above. To determine the total IgG, the serum was tested against the vaccine antigens. To identify ‘tag-specific’ reactivity (i.e., reactivity to either the MC2S domain or foldon domain), the serum was assayed against a Nipah F containing the respective tag. RSV A2 and MPV-GFP1 virus (strain CAN97–83) were propagated on Vero cells and stocks prepared were stored at -80°C. Viral titres were determined using plaque assay [58]. Briefly, Vero cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates (Nunc) at 5 × 104 cells/well in Opti-MEM supplemented with 3% FBS and 100 U penicillin with 100 μg/mL streptomycin. After overnight growth to allow a confluent monolayer, serial dilutions of virus stock were prepared in Serum-free Opti-MEM with 100 U penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. It was also supplemented with 2 µg/mL of TPCK-Trypsin and 1X Glutamax in the case of MPV. Cell monolayers were inoculated with 50μL of virus and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. After 1 hour incubation, in the case of RSV, the inoculum was topped up with overlay medium (Medium 199 with 1.5% methylcellulose, 2% FBS, 100 U penicillin with 100 μg/mL streptomycin), and in the case of MPV, the viral inoculum was removed before topping up with 1.5% CMC media. The plates were further incubated at 37°C for 72 hours. At the end of 72 hours, overlay medium was removed, the cells were fixed (80% acetone) and plaques were immunostained with either RSV specific human IgG Motavizumab or hMPV-specific human IgG MPV483. The primary antibody staining was followed by IRDye 800CW goat anti-human IgG, LI-COR Biosciences (1:2,500). Plaques were read using an Odyssey Imager (LI-COR Biosciences) and titre was recorded as PFU/mL. PRNT assays were performed as previously described [58]. Briefly, mouse sera samples were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes and serially diluted 1:10–1:21870. Equal volumes of viral suspension made in inoculum media by addition of virus stock to achieve the desired concentration of 2X103 PFU/mL were added to the serum dilution to achieve a final serum dilution of 1:20–1:43,740 and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour for the virus to be neutralised by serum antibodies. The inoculum media used for RSV was Opti-MEM with 100 U penicillin with 100 μg/mL streptomycin, while the media used for hMPV was also supplemented with 2 µg/mL of TPCK and 1X Glutamax. The residual viral infectivity in the sera/virus mixture was assayed by adding the mixture in duplicated to Vero cells monolayer cultivated in 96-well flat bottom plates. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour for virus adsorption to take place. This was directly followed by addition of overlay media in the case of RSV while the viral inoculum was removed before adding 1.5% CMC media in the case of hMPV. The plates were further incubated for 72 hours before fixing the cells with 80% acetone and plaque visualisation by immunostaining as above. PRNT assays for SARS-CoV-2 strain 614G and Influenza virus H1N1pdm A/California09 were conducted with similar methodologies as previously described [31,59]. Nipah virus neutralisation titre was assessed by lentivirus-based pseudo particle assay, as per a method previously described [60]. Human plasma depletion PRNT assays were performed as above. In the case of RSV, human plasma was serially diluted then first incubated at 37 °C for 1 hour either alone or with RSV Fsol, DSCav1 or VXB-213 diluted to 0.5 µg/mL. RSV A2 was then added to achieve the desired concentration of 2X103 PFU/mL and again incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. The mixture of virus, human plasma and depletion antigen was then added directly to cells and the PRNT assay performed as above. In the case of hMPV, the presence of antigen within the human plasma depletion PRNT assay had a non-desirable effect of directly blocking viral entry, presumably by receptor binding. Instead, 1.4 mg of VXB-221 or DsCavEs2 were each coupled to 0.1 g of CNBR-Activated Sepharose resin (Cytiva), as per manufacturer’s instructions. A control 0.1 g of CNBR-Activated Sepharose resin was produced with coupling buffer alone in parallel. The three Sepharose resins (control, VXB-221 and DSCavEs2) were inactivated and washed as per manufacturer’s instructions and then equilibrated with PBS. 1 mL of heat inactivated (HI) human plasma was added to each Sepharose resin and incubated on an end over end mixer for 2 hours at room temperature. Antigen depleted and control depleted human plasma were then collected into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and passed through a 0.22 µM filter syringe to ensure sterility and removal of Sepharose beads. Antigen depleted and mock depleted human plasma were then used directly in the hMPV PRNT assay as per mouse sera. Plaque visualisation for human plasma depletion PRNT was completed as above, however with RSV specific mouse IgG Motavizumab or hMPV-specific mouse IgG MPV483 followed by IRDye 800CW goat anti-mouse IgG, LI-COR Biosciences (1:2500). Analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 10.0.2 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, California USA, www.graphpad.com. Mann Whitney Test was performed to assess the statistical significance of differences between treatment groups in neutralising immune response.

Title: Wall Street’s AI Bubble Is Worse Than the 1999 Dot-com Bubble, Warns a Top Economist
URL: https://gizmodo.com/wall-streets-ai-bubble-is-worse-than-the-1999-dot-com-bubble-warns-a-top-economist-2000630487

Back in 1999, Wall Street lost its collective mind over the internet. Companies with no revenue were suddenly worth billions, “eyeballs” were treated as currency, and market analysts predicted a frictionless future where everything would be digital. Then the bubble burst. Between March 2000 and October 2002, an estimated five trillion dollars in market value vanished into thin air. Today, it is happening again. This time, the magic word is not â.com.â It is âAI.â According to Torsten Slok, the influential chief economist at Apollo Global Management, a major global investment firm, the current AI driven market bubble is even more stretched than the dot com frenzy of the late 1990s. And he has the data to prove it. âThe difference between the IT bubble in the 1990s and the AI bubble today is that the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 today are more overvalued than they were in the 1990s,â Slok wrote in a recent research note that was widely shared across social media and financial circles. The chart from Apollo compares the 12 month forward price to earnings (P/E) ratios of the top ten companies in the S&P 500 against the rest of the index. In plain English, a P/E ratio measures how expensive a stock is by comparing its price to its profits. A high P/E ratio means investors are paying a premium and are betting on strong future growth. Slok’s chart reveals something stunning: in 2025, the P/E ratios of the top ten companies are even higher than they were at the absolute peak of the dot com bubble in 2000. Torsten Slok: "The difference between the IT bubble in the 1990s and the AI bubble today is that the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 today are more overvalued than they were in the 1990s" pic.twitter.com/OEervHU4WG — zerohedge (@zerohedge) July 16, 2025 This means investors are betting so aggressively on AI giants like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Google that their stock prices have become detached from their actual earnings, even more so than tech darlings like Cisco and AOL were in the nineties. The top 10 companies driving this frenzy, which hold the most significant market value on Wall Street, include tech titans like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, and Meta. It is a super concentrated AI frenzy that is pushing a handful of mega cap stocks into nosebleed territory. You have probably heard that the S&P 500 is performing well this year. Here is the uncomfortable truth: most of those gains are coming from just those ten companies. The other 490 companies in the index are barely moving. This kind of narrow rally is incredibly risky. It means the health of the entire stock market is dependent on the performance of a very small number of firms. If Nvidia sneezes, the entire market could catch a cold. The problem is that Wall Street is treating AI as if it has already fulfilled every promise, from a productivity revolution to trillion dollar cost savings. The potential is being priced as a certainty, even though most of those gains have not yet materialized. In 1999, the internet was real. It did change everything. But that fact did not stop investors from wildly overpaying for companies that could not deliver on the hype. The parallels with todayâs AI excitement are chilling. Every corporate earnings call now dutifully mentions an “AI strategy,” just like every company in 1999 slapped on a â.comâ to its name. Stocks are surging on the vague potential of AI, not necessarily on real, current revenue. Wall Street is pricing in a perfect AI future without acknowledging the enormous risks: regulatory crackdowns, staggering compute costs, model hallucinations, or simply a slower than expected adoption rate. As Slokâs chart shows, the market is pricing these top ten AI heavy firms as if they are invincible. That is never a good sign. This is not a question of whether AI will change the world. It will, just as the internet did. The real question is how much investors are willing to pay today for profits that might not arrive for years, if ever. If history teaches us anything, it is that bubbles do not pop because the technology is fake. They pop when investor expectations dramatically outpace reality and the flow of easy money dries up. The more Wall Street bets on AI perfection, the more fragile this market rally becomes. If corporate earnings do not catch up to these sky high valuations, and soon, the market may not even need a specific trigger to deflate. The valuations alone could do the job. And when bubbles pop, they do not do so politely. They implode, wiping out trillions in value and shattering investor trust in the process. The technology called AI will certainly survive. The top ten companies likely will too. But the portfolios chasing this dream without a parachute might not. Just like in 2000, when it seemed the internet had made financial gravity obsolete, the AI hype train is speeding toward a cliff it thinks it can fly over.

Title: Synopsys CEO Sassine Ghazi took us inside his $35 billion acquisition of Ansys, which closes today

Diane Brady is an award-winning business journalist and author who has interviewed newsmakers worldwide and often speaks about the global business landscape. As executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative, she brings together a growing community of global business leaders through conversations, content, and connections. She is also executive editorial director of Fortune Live Media and interviews newsmakers for the magazine and the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. Synopsys CEO Sassine Ghazi just did something that’s making jaws drop: He convinced regulators in China and the U.S. to approve the company’s $35 billion acquisition of Ansys that’s set to close today. The reaction from fellow CEOs, he told me: “How did you get one of the most complex deals done in such a complex time?” With tensions high, the business case for bringing together two U.S. tech companies making products critical for Chinese clients wasn’t going to sell itself. “I’ve been to China maybe eight times this year,” he said. “I found myself being a U.S. ambassador to China, explaining the Synopsys position and understanding what they care about. And, back in the U.S., representing the importance and need for us as a global company to continue leading with innovation.” The tough part wasn’t the antitrust review of a $6.1 billion-a-year leader in chip design’s bid to buy a $2.5 billion-a-year leader in engineering software, he said. It was negotiating “access to the technology in the event things happen between the two countries.” What helped was “overwhelming customer support” and a recognition among Chinese regulators that “if they were too difficult or too constraining, it’s not good for China.” (The Federal Trade Commission had granted conditional approval in May.) His advice for others trying to win over authorities in both markets? “From the beginning, the message was consistent with the U.S. and with China: I’m not a politician. I represent a global company with opportunities that we see across every region,” he said. “With China in particular, I believe they have a great opportunity to take their strength in manufacturing and take it to the next level of intelligent manufacturing. And the U.S. has many, many other strengths with compute, software applications, etc. It’s important for Synopsys to have access to both markets to continue leading.” And it mattered that he went to China to speak with officials himself. “I was not getting an update once a month on how things are going. Did I have moments where it was depressing, leaving a meeting and seeing all kinds of surprises happening out of our control? Of course. At the end of May, we had a complete blackout and restriction on selling to China. That was a tough moment. I happened to be in China the week after, having to explain it, not knowing how long these uncertainties will be. I never doubted we’d get it done, but I started doubting the timing.”Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com 150 more countries will get tariffs of 10%-15% President Trump said letters would be sent to each government informing them of the “deals” they would receive. He also said he was “indifferent” to negotiating further with Europe. Trump claims he has changed the formula for Coca-Cola The president said the company had agreed to use cane sugar in its recipe moving forward instead of corn syrup. The company did not immediately confirm the change. JPMorgan plans data fee that could hit crypto JPMorgan’s plans to charge fees for access to customer account data could make it economically impossible for many consumers to use stablecoins and crypto, according to three industry executives, who declined to speak on the record for fear of retaliation. “This would cripple the crypto industry,” one of the execs said. How Carney approaches Trump Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has a remarkable way of keeping President Donald Trump calm and collaborative—so much so that he’s been dubbed the “Trump whisperer.” Here’s how he does it. Markets fluctuate on Powell moves Meanwhile, President Trump maintained on Wednesday that he was “highly unlikely” to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell despite reports this week of a letter Trump had drafted to do so. Markets dropped earlier in the day, but finished slightly higher on Wednesday than where they started. HPE reaches deal with Elliott Management Hewlett Packard Enterprise will give activist investor Elliott Management as many as two board seats as part of a new agreement following the latter’s criticism of the struggling company. The pressure on HPE CEO Antonio Neri won’t stop, however, and he could still lose his job. That Epstein thing won’t go away In a long post on Truth Social, the president insisted that anyone calling for the release of further information held by the government regarding Jeffrey Epstein was participating in a “hoax.” He said he wanted a decisive break with his own supporters who continue to push for more transparency around what the Department of Justice knows about the late billionaire financier and how he gathered his fortune: “I don’t want their support anymore!” Context: Epstein claimed he and Trump were friends for many years. S&P 500 futures were flat this morning, premarket. The index closed up 0.32% yesterday. STOXX Europe 600 was up 0.7% in early trading. China’s CSI 300 Index was up 0.68% this morning. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.6%. The UK’s FTSE 100 was up 0.4% in early trading. Bitcoin is holding on at the $118K level. Macquarie on the “fiscal capture” of tariffs: “Traders are staying complacent in the face of the new ('August 1') US import tariffs; they may reason that Pres. Trump doesn't want to preside over another market crash. But there's also the more ominous possibility that Trump has "moved on" from using tariffs to extract concessions, and is now using tariffs to boost tariff revenues. If that's the case, August 1 may see a flood of new higher tariffs, as well as retaliation. This "fiscal capture" of tariff policy shouldn't seem peculiar. After all, there are a myriad of reports that Trump's desire to replace the Fed's Chair also comes from a need to "fiscally capture" monetary policy, thus reducing the federal government's interest burden should debt levels rise,” per Thierry Wizman. Wedbush on woes at ASML: “View: ASML's preliminary remarks highlighted the impact geopolitical tensions and threatened US tariffs are having on future business prospects. While ASML's bookings (~25% ahead of prior expectations) seemingly point to solid near-term conditions; management pointed to a lack of clarity around future results given the potential impact of policy decisions. ASML management noted for instance a 30% tariff on European goods could for instance lift the price of an EUV tool from €250 to €325). As such, management suggested they could not at this juncture confidently forecast revenue growth in 2026 (a result that in turn is weighing heavily on the stock this AM),” per Matt Bryson and Antoine Legault. Wedbush on Q2 tech earnings preview: “In our view the Street is underestimating the underlying AI driven growth ahead and we expect a very strong 2Q tech earnings season over the coming weeks that further validates our bullish thesis led by Big Tech stalwarts … Our top 5 Wedbush tech picks for the second half of the year are Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft, Palantir, and Tesla,” per Daniel Ives et al.

Shareholders of tech and social media giant Meta, have sued for more than $8 billion in in fines and legal reimbursements, in relation to an alleged privacy scandal at Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook, as per reports. The action is based on relevations that data of millions of Facebook users was accessed by now defunct political consultant Cambridge Analytica, and alleges that around 11 executives — including Mark Zuckerberg himself and former Chief Operating Officer (COO) Sheryl Sandberg — indulged in insider trading and used the company to conduct illegal data harvesting, while the board failed to oversee the social media giant's operations. Interestingly, Cambridge Analytica worked for Donald Trump's successful US presidential campaign in 2016. Spokespeople for Meta did not immediately respond to queries, Bloomberg and Reuters said. The report said that the Meta shareholders, comprised largely of union pension funds, alleged that Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg “ran the company as an illegal data harvesting operation”, while the board “completely ignored their duty to oversee the company”. The claimants want reimbursement of over $8 billion in fines and legal costs from executives to Meta, which was paid to settle the 2012 privacy agreement violation to the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Trail in the Facebook ‘privacy scandal’ began at a Delaware court on July 16 (Wednesday), and is scheduled to last until July 25 (next Friday), according to a Reuters report. Notably, the case is being heard by Chancellor Kathaleen St. J McCormick — the judge who rejected Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s $55 billion pay package, as per a Bloomberg report. Among the defendants in the case are, venture capitalist and current board member Marc Andreessen; and former board members Peter Thiel, Palantir Technologies co-founder, and Reed Hastings, co-founder of Netflix. The suit alleges: Notably, after the insider-trading claims, Zuckerberg moved to seal his stock-trading strategies from public revelation during the trial, claiming that it is highly confidential information. Mark Zuckerberg controls about 61 per cent of the Meta board’s voting power through a dual-class share structure, effectively granting him sole control over the board composition and corporate strategy — past, present and future, the BB report noted.

Title: Corporate turnaround artist Jim Lanzone is “sticking to what users need” as CEO of Yahoo

On this episode of Fortune’s Leadership Next podcast, cohosts Diane Brady, executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative and Fortune Live Media, and editorial director Kristin Stoller talk to Jim Lanzone, CEO of Yahoo. They talk about the company’s nostalgia aspect, where it fits in a new era of search and AI, and keeping Yahoo a “guide to the World Wide Web.” Listen to the episode or read the transcript below. Jim Lanzone: But if you just stick to what users need, really need, not technology for technology’s sake. I saw this tweet, I can’t remember who did it, but she said, “I don’t want AI to create art so that I have time to do my laundry. I want AI to do my laundry so that I have time to make art.” Diane Brady: Good luck with that. Brady: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Leadership Next. The podcast about the people… Kristin Stoller: …and trends… Brady: …that are shaping the future of business. I’m Diane Brady. Stoller: And I’m Kristin Stoller. Brady: Yahoo, that’s what we’re talking about. I say “Ya-hoo” because I’m Canadian. Stoller: It’s your accent, and I love how you say it. But I, as a ’90s kid, say Yahoo. Brady: Yeah, and I say pasta. So it’s Yahoo and it’s Jim Lanzone, and he is the new CEO of a brand that is kind of hard to figure out. Tech, search, it’s media. It has been a cautionary tale. Is it a turnaround tale? What do you think? Stoller: I just want to bring us back for a second, to the golden age of Yahoo. Founded in 1994, think back, Diane—what were you doing then? And did you have a Yahoo email address? Or what was your email provider? Brady: I had just graduated. I was living in Asia. I remember my first email had many numbers in it, so I don’t think it was Yahoo. And look, I remember my first real encounter was when I came to the States, and I remember the arguments over whether we had to put the exclamation point, because they had an exclamation point in their name. And it used to honestly annoy me. It felt a bit sort of hubristic but yet it was the big beast in town. Stoller: See for me, all the cool kids at school had Yahoo and AOL. I was stuck with CompuServe because I think my dad got it for free. Yeah, I hated it. But okay, so now we’ve moved past—and although I don’t want to say move past, because they still have people with Yahoo email addresses, it’s still the number-two email I would assume, after Google or Gmail. Brady: A long number two. It has 3 billion hits a month, which makes you wonder about that intersection of influence—do eyeballs and influence still mean the same thing? And look, he’s an interesting guy. He’s an entrepreneur. He was at Tinder. He’s basically been a turnaround artist. He’s been there four years. And so what do you think? How much is Yahoo on your radar screen these days? Stoller: It’s really not. But I will say that I have two friends who work at Yahoo Finance and Yahoo News, and they love it and tell me they do really good work over there. Other than the journalism part of it, and I use Yahoo Finance to check stocks. I use it for stuff like that. I don’t use it for search. I don’t use it for anything else. And it was kind of a brand that I had thought, you know, had its heyday back in the early 2000s and they had so many missed opportunities. They lost the chance to buy Facebook, they missed out on a bunch of other deals. And I just thought they were kind of stagnant. Brady: But it lives to see a new day and like you, I’m very fond of the media properties, top notch journalists that they hire, I have to say. And look, I look forward to hearing what his vision is. You know, again, it’s, it’s past its 30th anniversary. As you pointed out, it’s still here, much like Ask Jeeves, which he also worked at. Stoller: Yes, he was the CEO of that pre-Google, pre-ChatGPT. Brady: So how do you turn around a legacy brand that has become a case study in failure. What does success look like? And it still has incredible traffic. So the bones, as he would say, are probably pretty good. Yeah, lots to talk about. Stoller: We’ll be back with Jim after the break. Brady: We’re entering an era of innovation unlike any we’ve witnessed before. You all see it: The pace of technological change is staggering, and it’s challenging for any leader to keep up. We spoke with Jason Girzadas, the CEO of Deloitte US, which is the longtime sponsor of this podcast. Here’s his advice for leaders on how to navigate this new world. Jason Girzadas: There’s probably nothing more important for CEOs, no matter what organization they’re leading, to really be thinking about technology’s impact on our workforce. It’s really a function of, how do you think about technology in concert with your workforce? We at Deloitte talk about it as the age of width, the age of technology with your workforce, and really embracing this idea of the codependency of technology and workforce. We’re also an environment of a very tight workforce where there’s a scarcity of top talent. That’s going to be the challenge for organizations, to demonstrate to top talent that they can grow and evolve the work that they do, working with leading technology in a very aligned way. Finally, it’s what top talent really wants in an organization, is to learn and grow and to be part of an organization that’s supportive of them actually embedding technology in their work. Brady: Jim, I think the first thing that would be good is define Yahoo as it is now, because obviously, it’s, you know, media, it’s been search, it’s email, it’s so many different—it’s a tech company. I mean, how do you define it in your mind? Lanzone: It’s funny, and I’ve said this a couple times, but historically speaking, they would ask that question of the Yahoo CEO onstage at conferences. Brady: Oh, well, here we are asking. Lanzone: It’s a bit of a gotcha. So it’s a great first question. But because, you know, again, I think all the different ups and downs in the company and along the way as a public company, which there’s a lot of different pressure that came along with that, had to try to figure out what its way was going to be as the internet was evolving. And I can go into it, but our team picked it up after that, so we didn’t have all those pressures. You can step back and look at it when we picked it up, and understand, first of all, it’s a conglomerate of a lot of different products. Some of those products have media or or use media as a feature. Some are utilities, right, like search or email. Even within some products. So let’s take sports where we definitely have media. We have the number one NBA podcast, we have the number one combat sports podcast, we have the number one newsletter. But the spine of the book for sports is fantasy sports. You know, where we’re the OGs, you know, sports scores and things like that. And those are more products. So I think at the end of the day, Yahoo is a product company, and I can go all into product… Brady: …a product conglomerate. A conglomerate of different products. Lanzone: But that is common these days. If you think about Meta, right? You have Facebook, you have Instagram, you have WhatsApp, you have Oculus. Now, you have AI. Even Google, with anything from Android to Waze to Android to YouTube. Amazon, obviously, same thing. All of the major internet companies, and Yahoo, after all this time, is still a top five internet company in the US and globally. We get there as a combination of brands, but Yahoo—and my team, we had to figure this out when we got here, you know, after all this time. We just had our 30th anniversary this year, you know. Brady: And you’re approaching your fourth. Lanzone: Yeah, I started [at the] end of September of 2021, right after Apollo bought the company. But you know, what’s our reason for being? Like, why does Yahoo exist, and why has it been so successful through all the ups and downs? Why is it still so large and used? And you know, the answer to that was one answer, which is in all the categories where we were still at the top. So we’re number one in finance, number two in news, really number two in sports. Brady: Doesn’t sound like much of a gotcha question, then. Lanzone: Well, all of these categories where we were still at the top is—we were still fulfilling the founder’s original mission of the company, like back in 1995, which was to be the trusted guide, you know, through the Wild West of the internet. It’s just that that job changed between 1995 when you were just trying to find websites to get things done, all the way through to now, where you’re deploying things like AI to help people get things done, right? So how you do it changes, but what we do, being the trusted guide to the internet, doesn’t change. Stoller: So I’m a kid of the ’90s, born almost around the time Yahoo was founded. So I remember it very vividly. I remember—also, I think it’s funny that this is very full circle for you, coming initially from Ask Jeeves, you were the CEO of that, and now coming back to an internet company, which is very full circle. So you’re right. I think Yahoo has gone through a bunch of ups, a bunch of downs, totally different than what it was in 1994. But I think that, you know, in the mid-2000s people were really worried about this company. And so when people came to you and said, “Hey, Jim, do you want to take this job?” What made you say, Yes, I will. I will do it in this uncertainty.” Brady: Jim, I like a challenge lens. Lanzone: Yeah. Well, I always wanted a crack at this. I knew every previous regime of this company, a lot of friends and colleagues who went through here…. Brady: …should we rate them all? Lanzone: No, I mean all the different teams, like, you know, Jimmy Pitaro and Jeff Weiner and Brad Garlinghouse. You know, just the really original teams. You know, even the first team, because I really had two things… Brady: …Jerry Yang? Lanzone: Jerry Yang, who’s still involved with the company. I just had him back for an all-hands meeting. He was amazing, yeah, for the 30th. He’s an investor in the new version of the company after we spun out of Verizon. It’s really a new corporation. So it, yeah, and he invested in it. So it’s amazing. But no, I had done two startups in the ’90s, or was involved with two early-stage companies in the ’90s. So that led me to Ask Jeeves, that was my first turnaround, and I learned the hard way, like, why were we able to do that? And we, you know, I think we almost 50x the stock from where we picked it up at the crash, in 2001 to the peak of where we got to before we sold to IAC. And we had a lot of traffic, but we had a product that had seen better days, and a brand that had been through the ringer, and a team that had been also through it because it was the first crash. So you had to rebuild all that. And once you got the basics right and you got the team rebuilt, and you were actually executing on your basic value proposition, you know, then you could innovate. And we innovated our tails off in that time period, 2003 to 2007. We were, you know, we were the ones who innovated, who really created the [inaudible] approach to search. That was what we were known for. We were the first major partner of Google when they started to syndicate AdWords, and that really made us profitable. Stoller: …and I used Jeeves like the OG ChatGPT, I would ask it so many questions. Brady: I want to bring us up to 2025, I mean, like, but let me ask, because I do—think you mentioned turnarounds, and Ask Jeeves is just one of the many you’ve done. And what was it, to Kristin’s point, that you saw as the opportunity with Yahoo? Because we’ve just heard a litany, and it’s all very correct as to where you’re number one. Obviously, it’s also been a case study in what not to do. What did you see as the runway that you could create? Lanzone: Well, remember that the—let’s say, the case study in what not to do, it was very interesting… Brady: …don’t turn down Google. Lanzone: Well, if you go do the forensics, which I did, if you are in the late 1990s early 2000s, search doesn’t have a business model yet, and you are the trusted guide to the internet, and there’s been a market crash and everything, outsourcing search to Google, and before that, they did [inaudible] me for the best price possible, which included a link to Google with their logo on the page that when you got there was only a search box, which is how 91% of internet sessions started at the time. That was like a good deal, just so happens that, you know, it really ceded search to Google, and I think the company spent a lot of time trying to figure out what it should be, and it went into media, and it tried to look at social, and it took another crack at search, and I mean, all kinds of things as a public company. It then eventually sold to Verizon in the mid-2010s. And so when we got it, it was after all that. So we had the luxury of not being public, but those basic ingredients were there, which was a huge audience, huge and very important categories. And so both Apollo, who bought the company, and then brought me in as CEO, and me, we, you know, I talked to them before they bought the company. Our thesis was, if you could get that asset at the right price, and it was around $5 billion and if you look around everybody in the top 10 Comscore internet companies, they’re all trillion-dollar companies. You could work with that. And so I, you know, again, I could go through it, but we set about the turnaround process using those raw ingredients, and that’s where we are today. Stoller: What was the hardest decision you had to make when you took over? Was it cutting, restructuring, betting on a new product? What was really difficult for you? Lanzone: Well, you knew all that coming in. You knew that there was gonna have to be some turnover on the team. You also, and this has been true every time I come into a new company, you also find a lot of talent and can redeploy them in new ways. So step one is always rebuilding the team, getting great people involved. You know, as a CEO, especially if something is big, you can’t do everything and so that always is step one, and, and so yeah, from there, there are certain products that, you know, like search or email that are huge and things you need to invest in to get back on track. And, and then ones where, you know, in the case of email, it hadn’t really been upgraded. And I mean, literally over a decade at those levels. And so when you start putting those things in place, you can start to get early returns. The hardest decision was probably how early on we had to essentially renovate our ad tech group, which was something that both AOL and Yahoo had spent many years acquiring a lot of companies, 30-plus companies. Brady: What do you mean renovate? How does one renovate an ad tech group? Lanzone: Well, we had to make some really hard decisions about what we’re going to invest in and where we didn’t have a right to win. And so we were doing a lot of things, a lot of different businesses. We had a native advertising business, we had a supply-side platform. And we shut those down. In some cases, we outsourced those to others, and then we decided, well, where we can win is our DSP, our demand-side platform, so we’re going to invest there. So that decision, my second year there, or, you know, actually made the decision before my first anniversary, required, you know, having a lot of people leave the company and doing deals to outsource things that we had been building for years. But that decision saved hundreds of millions of dollars a year on the cost side, but really strategically, let us refocus on put something that could really be a big asset creation opportunity, which is our DSP, where we are now the world’s largest private DSP, competing with trade desk, Google, Google’s version of that, Amazon’s version of that. And, you know, I think we’re still early days now and innovating in that space. Brady: I want to talk about what’s ahead. But one of the things I like about your career, Jim, is the eclectic nature of it. And I know I’ve, I’ve had an eclectic career myself. One of the benefits is you get to work with all kinds of cool people. And I think of your career, you’ve got Les Moonves, you’ve got Barry Diller. You mentioned Jerry Yang. I mean, there’s so many different people. I’m curious who stands out for you as either a mentor or just somebody—I mean, these are personalities. I’ve met them myself, and how has that influenced you? And when you look back, who do you think of fondly, or maybe not so fondly? I mean, we’re open to both here. Stoller: Yeah, give us all the dirt, Jim. Lanzone: When you’ve been around doing this this long, and again, I’ve done consumer internet now for basically 28 years, and have had those different times. I can bore you with how many of those are influential on me. Brady: No, go ahead. I want to hear. Stoller: Name-drop, feel free. Lanzone: When I left Barry and [unintelligible] I did a startup from scratch. And Bill Gurley, who wrote for Fortune for many years, and Jeff Yang were my two main investors. And the idea for that came from another big mentor of mine, Dave Goldberg, who was a very close friend, but also a huge mentor, we came up… Brady: Yeah, I knew Dave. SurveyMonkey. Lanzone: Well, he did SurveyMonkey when I went to do Clicker, but the whiteboard was in his EIR office, a benchmark of doing the future of video search and and then Blake Krikorian, another very close friend who passed away a year later, who was the founder of Slingbox, was also on the board of that startup, and was a huge friend, but also a huge mentor, you know, of mine. Yeah, you learn different things from all of them along the way, and, and obviously, with Barry, you know, I remember, we were in the back of a car, and I’ve always been fascinated by, well, by media, but also by, like, the history of things. And so I would always pepper him, like, how did you greenlight Airplane? And I get the story about he and Michael Eisner, you know, had offices next to each other, and he heard laughs coming out. And you know, they both had been reading the script. And he says, but before that was The Kentucky Fried Movie. And I mean, you just hear this history of how they do these things. And I remember him saying to me, you know, this is in the back of the car in like, 2007, I wonder if we started today, if we would have been as successful. And obviously, 18 years later,the answer is, of course. Barry Diller is one of the world’s best entrepreneurs, it turns out, you know, over the last 30 years. But his way of drilling into the core idea of things. Always, I remember him saying, there’s always another way around the mountain. And I always say that to my team, if we get stuck on something, Brady: You know, he told me once, the hardest thing to hire for is curiosity, which always stuck with me, because he’s right, and you’re very curiosity-driven. That’s the way you talk to people, isn’t it? You mentioned, you just go and you try to get to know them. Lanzone: Well, that’s part of his drilling down on, on the core idea, you know, and not just going just off the data, which, again, is also very important. I’m a product person at heart, you know, if I take a new job, drilling into the data is probably the first thing I do. But between him, less, where, you know who ran, obviously, that company very successfully as a public company. But what was also the number one? Brady: This is when you were at CBS Interactive? Lanzone: At CBS Interactive, and knowing that it also was about gut and the core idea, and I’ve other friends, like Tony Fadell, who helped… Brady: …with Nest… Lanzone: … with Nest but also created the iPod and helped create the iPhone. And there’s a lot of it that is the art side too. And I really believe in the right-brain side of this, the taste side of this. And in the early stages of a turnaround, you can’t always show that side, but then you always get to the point, right? At CBS, the initial challenge was they had bought CNET, which was a struggling public company, and it needed to be turned around first. The reward for that was we created CBS All Access, which was one of the first streaming platforms, and we launched that in 2014, five years before HBO Max and Disney+ and that was at the end of the day, a gut decision. We got criticized when we launched that, that it wasn’t going to work, and how dare one network have its own streaming service? So, yeah, I’ve learned that both of those are very important. Stoller: For us, I feel like, or at least for me, and maybe you, Diane, when I think Yahoo, I immediately think media. And I think it’s just, you know, we’re journalists. We have all these… Brady: Not email? My sister still has her Yahoo email account. Stoller: Yeah, as I told you earlier, I was a CompuServe girl then an AOL, so sorry, Jim. Lanzone: Still have all of those URLs. Stoller: Yeah, exactly. But I’m wondering about, you know, from a non-journalist perspective, how do you kind of view the media industry at Yahoo and just in general, how are you looking at what’s next for your journalists? Lanzone: Yeah, well, part of what we figured out when we got here was, again, you do the forensics on the company. What makes it successful. The history of why Yahoo even got into media at all was not by being investigative journalists or on the enterprising side of news, but by being the first and best aggregator of news and being a partner to people like Fortune, by sending them traffic, sharing the revenue. It’s funny to see AI companies now trying to ink those deals. We have 1000s of those deals that go back 20+ years with companies. We still operate that way today. If you go to our page, we are sending traffic to Business Insider who would have, you know, those stories and help them be successful. We then, you know, accentuate that with our own journalists who are providing context to that. Whether it’s sports or Brian and Julie and team in finance, that really is where Yahoo is strong, and how we do journalism. And over the last three years, as we figure out what’s our role in that ecosystem, I think our role is to be the trusted guide, to be purple, to be neutral, and to help our users wherever they may fall on any spectrum, get to the content that they’re looking for and be partners with people. Brady: Asset-light. It sounds like an asset-light strategy. If I look at the humans as assets, does that position you well, for the next generation of where we go with media? Lanzone: Well, we do—look, we also have a lot of humans… Brady: …we know several… Stoller: …yeah, I know two of them! Lanzone: If you come up to our studio, uptown, we have an amazing studio, and, you know, by the end of this year we’ll be doing 50 hours a week of original programming just in sports. So we also are producing media, but again, I would say, in service of helping our users accomplish their goals. And that is a little bit different, right? Because in finance, they’re trying to make money or save money. In sports, they are trying to beat the snot out of their friends in fantasy, or they’re trying to be a smarter fan about their team that they’re following. It always is in service of something that our users are trying to get done. And so I would just say our role in the ecosystem of media is, I think it’s very important, because we have a huge amount of traffic, and we send a huge amount of traffic, and we’re very thoughtful about how we do that and what that product needs to look like, and how we partner to keep it a very healthy media ecosystem. We’re big believers in that. If we violate trust with our users, and I would say over time, that is something that you know, probably as the different variations of Yahoo and different owners of Yahoo, it probably wavered a bit, but we knew that is the first thing. Like, we have to be the trusted source for people, and that means we also have to have trusted partners. Like, we can’t be sending people to click bait or to attention vampires who are just trying to get you. We got to send them to the highest quality content. Stoller: It seems like you have competitors in a bunch of different spaces. You have, like Google, dare I say, you have other media competitors like Fortune. Brady: And AI. I keep waiting for the deepfake news call, right? Stoller: Yeah. I think you know, what they’re going to do to search is wild. Who do you view as, like, your biggest competitors? And how are you fighting back? Lanzone: Well when we did the original Google deal in 2002, Eric Schmidt, people said, “How could you do that?” I mean, we were the fourth-ranked search engine. We survived everybody else. Stoller: So people were questioning it back then? Lanzone: Oh yeah, how could you do that? And Eric had the term “co-opetition,” and… Brady: …as he would… Lanzone: …but we were public and they weren’t. So we were almost their tracking stock for the first couple of years, and so, yeah, I mean, we helped each other on that front, and maybe we competed for users. But from our standpoint, we always had to have a unique reason for being relative to them. That’s true of anything that I’ve ever run. You know, CBS products, Yahoo products, I mean, they all have to be unique. So that’s how I think about it. If you talk to my team, though, you would hear every single one of our team say the same thing, which is we really don’t get distracted by competition. You have to keep tabs, obviously, on the way the ecosystem is changing. When I took this job in September ’21 it was still 14 months before ChatGPT launched. That changed the world. That created opportunities and threats for us. I think they’re more market driven then, instead of individual companies and products necessarily. And we think about taking over Yahoo, we have so much to do that I really think we’re competing against ourselves more than we are anybody else, at least for now. We’ve just so many things, if we get those right, that we will keep growing. We are growing a really healthy clip again now, and so that’s really what I focus on. Brady: So let’s talk about that a little bit. And I want to unpack your background a bit more too. But where, you said it’s early days, what are you focused on right now? I mean in terms of your priorities, the pain points. I mean, what should we be expecting in terms of what’s around the corner. Because you’re private, you can tell us.. Lanzone: That’s been great. I still think of myself as an entrepreneur at core and a founder, but I’ve been wound up in all these public companies and larger companies. It does feel good to be able to do this in private for a while and in Apollo, as the, you know, full owners of Yahoo, we have some other investors, but it really is an Apollo company, they’ve been great. Because we were one of the fastest returning deals in the history of Apollo, and that’s enabled us to be all upside. And so they really have been letting us do this right and play a little bit of a longer game than you might get normally in private equity. And so I think about that product by product, and in terms of, like, what we do, you know from here. And I would say we are—the reason I think it’s still early days is step one was just fixing the things that were wrong. And you’d be surprised, like, how little this company, even on the very back end, had moved to the cloud. I’m just saying something as basic as… Brady: Even with Verizon as an owner, I’m surprised by that. Lanzone: You’d be surprised. And now I would say, is every pixel of that something that I want to put my name next to and say that is the best product that that can be? No. You know, I think there are 10 levels left to go here on what we can do. And I also always tell the team we can’t just be brats. And, you know, I always say skip levels of the video game, you know, you got to earn it every level by every level, to earn the right to innovate and progress. Now with AI, that’s added a whole other set of things that we need to do. I feel like we’ve been out ahead of that. We were one of the first ones to integrate, let’s say, AI into email to help people create, search, edit their mail. There are other, you know, parts of that that are coming. You know, same thing in search. Even things like fantasy sports have AI integrated to help you manage your team. There’s even a smack talking email that comes out, you know, from AI every Sunday night, whether you won or lost. Thinking about finance, you know this category and how it helps you build your portfolio. So besides the basics, we have to do that, and then there’s innovation and our hopes and dreams for where all these products can go next. I’d also lastly say the brand is another very important part of this, because the Yahoo brand did go through the ringer for a lot of years. Lanzone: That exclamation point used to always piss me off. Stoller: I like it. Lanzone: Yeah, people love it. Brady: It used to, now I have a different view. Stoller: So is it a marketing push to revamp a brand, or, how do you revamp a brand that kind of, as you said, went through the ringer? Lanzone: I mean, it takes time. Yeah, you really have to earn that. And again, having seen that movie a few times. The thing about Yahoo that is awesome, is that even though there is a bit of that, you know, that history and so people are going to want to ask that question, and we’re going to really have to earn it. There’s also this interesting latent kind of love for the brand that is in there and people, especially as you kind of get out of the Valley a bit, and I think the Valley has started to feel good about what we’ve been doing with the company. But to get to the, let’s say the average American, there is some latent love in there if you do it right. And including, you know, half of our audience today is Gen Z and millennials. Brady: You have a massive audience, we will point that out. Stoller: Half of them weren’t born when Yahoo was created, Lanzone: Yeah, and so, so everybody’s using Yahoo at a certain point in time, and we’re top five, we touch 90% of all the U.S. any given month. But again, as a brand, you have to earn that right to where they’re proud to be using Yahoo and be talking about it. And so that’s brick by brick, over time. And we, you know, we’ve started down that pathway. Step one, you have to have great products. If you don’t have that, people are going to talk smack about the brand, let alone love it. But I think we’re on the pathway there. And then we, you know, we started with small things up to big things. On the small side, through a really interesting event at South by Southwest, where we partnered with this retro, kitschy brand called Poolsuite, and we had a ’90s-vibe party that everyone was like, “Oh, this is the coolest party in South by Southwest. I can’t believe it’s Yahoo.” Stoller: You’re leaning into the ’90s cheese I love. Lanzone: And that was, like a small one. On the larger end, we did a Super Bowl ad this year for the first time in 23 years, but we did it in a super unique way, where we weren’t asking for anything. We weren’t trying to market our way to success. It was just getting the brand back out there. And again, we did it uniquely. We had Bill Murray. Bill Murray is a very unique character. We only bought the ad locally, so it was actually very cost-effective as well. And then the ad was really just a 15-second teaser that got people into an online experience using Yahoo Mail, where you would email back and forth with Bill Murray, and he would send you additional videos that were vignettes that told this story that he wrote with his writing partners. Stoller: How’d you convince Bill Murray to do it? Brady: He’s everywhere. He’s a good guy. Lanzone: Harder than you think. It was only the second ad he’s ever done. Stoller: What was the pitch? How’d you do it? Lanzone : Actually, he famously has no agent and no manager, and you have to call a 1-800 number. We somehow worked it through to get his attention and explain it to him. And Bill is interesting. He likes the underdog, and he loved the idea of working with Yahoo to help us kind of fight back. And I would argue, he almost really took us under his wing. Another example of that is that one of the things that they conceived of was that he would answer those emails live on camera at halftime. And up until the day before the game, we didn’t know if it was gonna happen. I mean, he really, he’s a busy guy. He was like in a band. He played a concert the night before. Brady: Can he type that fast? I don’t even know. Lanzone: So not only did he do it, but we announced it only 20 minutes before it happened through social channels. And we end up getting millions of people up against the Kendrick Lamar halftime show tuning in to watch Bill on camera, and he would, he was actually like, talking to the user who emailed in, and he would answer it live. He would do it into a microphone. He was saying what he… Brady: The beauty of improv. Lanzone: Yeah. And then he continued to do it the entire second half. Didn’t have, didn’t have to do it. And so it was a personal thing for Bill. And so, yeah, so I’m still in touch with him. He’s an amazing guy. Brady: I can picture you. The Yahoo CEO sort of emailing Bill Murray and getting good advice from him. Lanzone: He wouldn’t do it if it wasn’t authentic. And I think, again, if I were to say what the take on rehabilitating the brand has to be, is it has to be authentic. We can’t be too thirsty about wanting attention or trying to classically market your way there. Brady: You know, one of the benefits of working in different roles, starting companies, you discover what you’re good at. You know, when, when did you discover that you were particularly good at the things that you think are helping you in this role? Lanzone: That’s a great question. The whole way I started doing this was I went to law school. I hated it. I would have left, but I met my wife the first minute of law school… Brady: …stick around to court each other… Lanzone: …we were living together two weeks later, and that was 31 years ago. We’ve been together that whole time. If it wasn’t for that, I wouldn’t have stayed. And I had some friends who did the business school program, so I, with no experience, applied and got in, and that summer, somehow wound up working for a company that was digital in the old school way. They sold public records to like, law firms and, you know, businesses and private detectives whenever, through dial up. And my job was to get them an internet website. And the CEO thought I was, you know, I was an early adopter of the internet, obviously, and used it a lot. So I copied the fantasy baseball website that I used at the time, and we turned that into, by the end of the year, a top 100 website. I worked with the engineers to build it. I did all the PR. I put the ads on the page. I did everything. And so that led to me joining a startup while I was still in school, and we raised money and so I was always a product person. So I’ve always come at this, when I got to Ask, I was the head of product. Our turnaround was so successful that my boss, Steve Berkowitz, who was the CEO, got hired to run all of internet for Microsoft. Satya [Nadella] reported to him, and that’s how I got promoted to CEO. So I only got, you know, I never really applied for a job. I always started companies that have been acquired, and in this case, I was part of Apollo’s research team, essentially for whether you should do Yahoo. But I come at this as a product person, as a founder, not as big boss man corporate, you know, person. And I think the best internet companies are still or technology companies are still run that way. Whether you are the founder, you’re not. My job is to push to be the, you know, to determine whether something is good enough, and to really drive that, obviously, to help set the strategy and the roadmap, but to be a source of momentum. And you know, that grind of doing a startup or doing a turnaround, that’s all I’ve ever done. And so the way to do that is you push and with great people around you, and that that’s what we do. Stoller: If you could go back in time and give advice to Yahoo’s leadership, you know, during the dotcom boom, what would you want to say to them as a CEO today? Lanzone: I really, I mean this in a non… Brady: …buy Facebook… Lanzone: …well, here’s the thing, not everybody, if everyone can hear the whisper, everybody tried to buy Google. Ask Jeeves tried to buy Google. They couldn’t hit the number. So they bought a company called Direct Hit, which actually was the inventor of all user behavior algorithms that that Ask eventually licensed to Google. So there’s always another way around the mountain if you don’t get it. Brady: Success comes in many forms. Lanzone: I really don’t know that any of us can put ourselves in the position of a public company, of the biggest internet company in the year 2000. The market crashed, I think, in March of 2000. We were writing our S1 to go public, my startup, though, and then one by one, everything crashed. So AltaVista didn’t get out. And then this happened. So how do you go back and tell them not to outsource search to Google, right? Or if you do make it white label, don’t give them a link and a logo. Brady: I remember Priceline was having us bid for groceries and web fans. So things change. But well, let’s put you then circa 2025, and you are in a big legacy brand. If you were starting out now, you know, entrepreneurial as you are, what would you be doing? Would you be doubling down on, you know, some of the AI companies—because here we are at the dawn, you know, we had the internet, we had 2.0 and here we are at the dawn of a whole new age of innovation. Obviously, you’re navigating through that, trying to bring in those tools and that innovation. But what would you be doing at this point, starting out? Lanzone: Man, there’s so many ways. I would be founding a company, you know, and it would have to be in the AI space, obviously, from my background. And by the way, my son has now just turned 24 and it’s his second year out of college. He’s a programmer at an AI startup. Called Meeno… Brady: …and shoutout to Meeno, well done, son. Lanzone: But by the way, there are others. So you know, one of my longtime colleagues, who’s a board member, has a very successful startup called Array that has defined the next generation of labor, and is deploying, you know, real people and humans. You know, they talk about manufacturing, moving to China and needing to bring it back. There’s already a lot of great people in the US doing this. His company does that. It definitely deploys AI and technology. But starting great companies doesn’t have to be that, but if it was me, of course, it’s too… Brady: …but you’re also trying to recruit great talent. So why do they want to come to Yahoo right now? Lanzone: Look, a lot of places you go, first of all, you’re going to be a cog in the machine. So a lot of people who come here, and by the way, it’s a lot easier to recruit in year three than it was in year one. You know, we’ve had, we’ve got some momentum now, so we’ve got some people’s attention. And by the way, as an example, we will get at least 1,000 applications for every person that we hire as an engineer. So we do get a lot of incoming, but it’s to be able to have that impact. Number one is, personally, they can have that impact. Number two, we have, you know, one of the top five largest audiences in the US and globally, to actually deploy the thing that you’re building, which is the hardest part of any consumer internet startup, is actually getting a real audience and we start with that as kind of a late stage startup. Again, we already have that audience, so that really does attract people. Stoller: Jim, I have a bit of a fun one for you, because I can tell that you are a very good storyteller. Besides getting to email and meet Bill Murray, what is the wildest or most unexpected thing that you have done as CEO at Yahoo, or just coolest that you want to tell us about? Lanzone: The Bill Murray one must have… Stoller: Is that top five? Lanzone: Yeah, would have been. I mean, I’ll tell you an interesting brand moment. I was sitting in Levi’s Stadium, which is the 49ers’ home, and I’m a longtime season ticket holder, and… Brady: Condolences, I’m just kidding. Stoller: You’re doing very well. Lanzone: Oh, the Niners, it’s been a great run. Super Bowl is next. Brady: Never mind. Stoller: Clearly we don’t know sports. Lanzone: We’ve been robbed a couple times. But I was sitting there and I guess I didn’t realize this before I took the job. But every time the Niners score a touchdown, up on the screen it turns into a Yahoo, a Yahoo Sports highlight of the touchdown at the end, there’s actually a yodel with the logo going across the page, and all 80,000 people scream Yahoo at the top of their lungs in a yodel and in the middle of Silicon Valley. And that’s when I knew there was something to work with here, brand wise, that it could be done. Stoller: Had you planned the Yahoo yodel, is that a thing? Lanzone: No, I inherited that. That was a deal that was done 10 years prior, during Marissa’s time, and I renewed it. And because it’s just such a, it’s such a great moment. That was such a surprise, for sure. Stoller: I slightly want to ask you to re-create the yodel right here. But I feel like… Brady: …no, let’s do it. Lanzone: We do have, you know, the “easy button.” Yeah, we do have yodel button easy buttons. Stoller: Oh, that’s good branding. Lanzone: Hilariously, they are—we have an amazing social team, and they’ve done things like for April Fools, this year. They created a, if you know about the touch grass, they created a keyboard that was all covered in grass, everything. But another thing they do is they actually, for a limited time offer, they sold those yodel buttons on there… Brady: …Okay, we have to do the yodel… Lanzone: …they sold out in five minutes, like $20 each. Stoller: Who’s buying these? Lanzone: That was another, you know, surprising time for sure. Brady: Sounds like a lot of fun over there. Stoller: Would you ever change the yodel? Is it too iconic? Lanzone: We did, in a way that you wouldn’t have noticed. We shortened it by two seconds. Brady: Oh, so then was it Yahoo. Come on, why am I the one doing the Yahoo yodel? You’re the Yahoo CEO. Lanzone: It’s too—it’ll get clipped by my team and used against me at company all hands meetings. Look, even having Jerry, you know, Jerry back this year, and showing a picture of the trailer that he and David founded the company in. Or, you know, we actually showed him that, not only are we back to his original mission, and how we’ve articulated that kind of made him well up a little bit. But the original Yahoo website, the one that was pre-incorporation. So you said ’94. Incorporation was ’95 but they did have a website available in 1994. It said, “Jerry and David’s guide to the World Wide Web…always under construction.” And we took that and we made it like the number one core operating principle for us that Yahoo, you know, look, we’re still here after 30 years, a lot of ups and downs. We have some ups now, and we’re on the right track. But if you couldn’t, you know, kill us before, we’re on a track now where you could see another 30 years if we do this, if we do this right. So always under construction to us, meant that, you know, everything about technology may change, right? Think about from the original time: video now, and social and AI, and just all the different parts of this. We still have to help people accomplish their goals… Brady: …make sense of the world… Lanzone: …we always have to be adapting, and that really is guiding how we think about the company. Brady: I’m thinking of Glengarry Glen Ross, “always be closing.” Different concept. You know, one thing that I feel bonds us all here, and you know, Oura should really give us product placement money, but we’re all wearing Oura rings for those who can’t [see]. And so I often think of the fact that to be a CEO these days is to be an elite athlete. And Kristin and I are not putting ourselves in your category, of course, but talk about how you manage your day, your energy, because I certainly look at my ratings every morning and consider my sleep and my energy. Lanzone: How’d you do last night? Brady: I never do well. I don’t like—but I… Stoller: She never wants to answer the number question with sleep, by the way. Lanzone: Well, I think today was seventy-something. Lanzone: How much REM sleep did you get? Stoller: I only got 23% last night. It’s pretty good, right? Brady: I operate on a different wavelength, perhaps. Lanzone: My wife and I also have Eight Sleep and it’s amazing, too. And it gives you a whole other score. Brady: I do think about the fact that it feels like, the attention to the physicality of the job and health, and obviously there’s many factors, but how do you manage that? And do you feel like you do it differently? First of all, you’ve got tools, and you’re wearing this ring on your finger. And how was your sleep last night? I’d be remiss not to ask you. Lanzone: Took me a while to fall asleep, then I crushed it after that. I think I had two hours, two solid hours of REM. That was like a lot. A funny side story is that Tom Hale, the CEO of Oura, and I, were entrepreneurs in residence at Redpoint Ventures in 2008 when I left IC. We were the only two, and we were in the bullpen together. Way back when… Brady: So is this you supporting your friend or do you actually like it? Lanzone: And then he worked at SurveyMonkey. So if you’ve been around a long time… Stoller: You know ’em all. Lanzone: Yeah, yeah. So no, look, I’ve gone through my fits. And so, you know, when you have kids for the first time, your [in your] ’30s and everything changes, you don’t realize, and you have to get your act together about staying in shape. And if you do something that you love, you work a lot. In this job, I also just travel a ton. I’m just on the road a lot for different events and conferences and for ad sales, and, you know, whatever it is to our different offices. So it’s harder. Brady: Do you have any hacks you want to share? I don’t, so. Lanzone: Honestly, I think it is just the same as the grind of running a company. And again, I saw in a different podcast, you asked somebody about a book, the book that I always go back to is Shoe Dog by Phil Knight. If anyone wants to think that Nike happened overnight or they were just brand geniuses. I mean, it took years of building that company. And I think any company is like that, early stage, late stage, if you’re doing it right. I think it’s the same thing with your health. It’s the same thing with staying in touch with friends. Nothing’s just going to happen. You have to make it happen. And that could be getting on the treadmill or the elliptical or lifting weights or going for a run. It could be spending time with your spouse. It could be spending time with your kids. I make a really big effort not just to do that, but my mom passed away a couple years ago, so I spent a lot of time with my dad, you know, but also friends. And so, you know, I’ve gone to two live concerts in the last week. Stoller: Which ones? Did you go to Avril Lavigne on Friday? Lanzone: Well, the last one I went to, no, on Friday night, I was—well, I’m on the board of the Newport Folk Festival and Jazz Festival, which is like my passion project, and I’ve done that for about 10 years. So that’s more my jam on the music side. So I was at, there’s a band called The Hold Steady. Their lead singer is Craig Finn. He has a solo album that just came out. So his album release party was Friday night at the Bowery Ballroom. And Kathleen Edwards, who’s this amazing folk indie singer out of Canada, opened and played in the band. They had like an-all star band, the guy from war on drugs was in it. And so my wife and I, we did date night and went, went to that. Brady: Newport Folk Festival. So, I mean, I always think of that now with the Bob Dylan movie. But of course, you know, so you’re a folk fan, that’s interesting, yeah. Lanzone: Well that, you have to go look at some of the YouTube videos, the movie isn’t exactly how that happened. Stoller: No, I knew that. Well, I read the book, and I was like, Yes, it’s very different. Brady: We vilified Pete Seeger too much, perhaps, or… Lanzone: …it was funny how it all works. You know, one of my biggest mentors in life, who was a CBS board member, was a guy named Bruce Gordon, who was the chairman of Newport. We actually live across the hall from each other in New York as well. So Bruce and his wife are our family here in New York, but I was also friends before he passed away with George Wein, who’s the founder. He was the creator of the Music Festival. He got a Grammy for creating—so if you go to Coachella or anything, it was because of George launching Newport Jazz originally, and then the Newport Folk. But yeah, hearing the old stories again, I love it, and hearing about Miles Davis and Nina Simone, or how he had to get Led Zeppelin to play acoustic to chill the crowd out so like a riot wouldn’t happen, or what happened for real with Bob Dylan. Like you got all those—he just passed away a couple years ago at 96 but getting all the stories… Stoller: Well now that we’ve taken this podcast completely out… Brady: I sense the joy. Where do you get the most joy out of your job? You get a lot of joy out of life, I sense. Lanzone: Well, I definitely do, but I love, you know, my kids are always worried about how much I work, and I love it. Brady: You never work a day again if you love what you do. Lanzone: I mean, again it’s the first—in some ways, you’re always working in a job like this. I mean, first of all, this wasn’t easy. It’s not an easy one. There’s also just a lot to it. Because if you go back to the conglomerate, there’s just so many different things that we do. There’s so many people—I love this team. I’ve always just been lucky to have great teams that are not just great at what they do, but just we always kind of, we’ve always wound up having a cultural situation where we just all love hanging out and we have that. So I’m always, in some ways, dipping in and out of work but again, it’s also one reason is just—I truly am never, this probably annoys the team, but I’m kind of just never satisfied. And think there’s always some other thing to do, or something we can do better, or something on the roadmap that we need to get to. And so I’m just always, my brain’s just always firing on those things. Stoller: Jim, I’m going to ask you later outside of the studio about the Newport Folk Festival lineup, because I’m really excited about it this year. But before we go, is there anything that we haven’t asked you that you wanted to share with us or tell us about? Oh… Lanzone: Oh man, I wouldn’t know. We’d have to look at the comments to know whether we did or whether we were annoying people. Brady: But always interactive with the audience. But paint us a little bit of a vision for what you want Yahoo to be. I mean, take us out as far as you want. But obviously you said it’s early days. So tell us what, what’s your hope and aspiration there? Lanzone: Let’s just say there’s the company piece, and then there’s the product piece, and I’d say, or even the brand piece. So yeah, I hope we can get the brand back on the map in a way where we reward that kind of latent love that I think that always has been out there across generations, you know. And it may be that it’s a bit of a vintage, modern-vintage brand if you are younger, but I think we can earn that. You know, other brands have done that. I think Chris has done an amazing job with that, New Balance is one example. There’s no reason if our products are great that we couldn’t do the same thing. The company’s on a great track. I’d love to deliver for our investors and for our team to reward that, whatever that winds up meaning, you know. All pre-IPO companies is you either go public or you get bought someday by someone who needs what you have. I think we’re building a lot and have a lot of things others might need. So that all needs to happen. But again, most of my day is going to be on the product side, and that evolution, everything is obviously changing now, more than it ever has probably. I mean, I know, talking to some people, they said, Oh, it’s bigger than the dawn of the internet, but others think it’s, it could be bigger than the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. I mean, it could, it remains to be seen, but if you go, if you just stick to what users need, really need, not technology for technology’s sake. I saw this tweet. I can’t remember who did it, but she said, “I don’t want AI to create art so that I have time to do my laundry. I want AI to do my laundry so that I have time to make art.” Brady: Good luck with that Lanzone: And I think, we can’t be judgmental on our side about what our users need to get done, big or small. We need to create these products to help them do that. That’s clearly evolving. More and more is going to happen in an automated way, helping you do things that you need done, maybe before you knew that they needed to be done. Or what that next step is in that pathway. In the categories we operate in now, and I would say, if we do this right, we will earn the right to do it in other categories as well. That’s where I want to get to. That’s what will create true loyalty, you know, and trust in our brand. So I don’t know if that sounds cheesy. Lanzone: Thank you for joining us. I look forward to it. Appreciate spending the time.

The lawsuit seeks compensation from them for losses exceeding $8 billion that Meta incurred due to the FTC fine and other legal expenses. Meta has shown a questionable track record on user privacy. As a result, Meta Platforms shareholders are pursuing an $8 billion trial against Mark Zuckerberg and other current and former executives. Today, several executives, including Zuckerberg, will testify in the $8 billion trial at Delaware Chancery Court. The court will hear the trial without a jury. This case dates back to 2018. It’s related to Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm active during Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, accessing data from millions of Facebook users. Following this issue, the FTC fined Facebook $5 billion in 2018 for violating a 2012 agreement to protect user data. Meanwhile, shareholders demand $8 billion from the defendants to reimburse Meta for the FTC fine it paid and related legal costs. Court filings show the defendants call the allegations “excessive.” Zuckerberg and others plan to present evidence proving that Cambridge Analytica misled them. For those who don’t know, the political consulting firm no longer operates. In addition to Mark Zuckerberg, former COO Sheryl Sandberg, board member and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, Palantir Technologies co-founder Peter Thiel, and Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings are all expected to testify in the case. Meta shareholders claim Mark Zuckerberg predicted the tech company’s share price would drop after the Cambridge Analytica scandal. They also say Zuckerberg sold his shares and earned at least $1 billion from those sales. In short, allegations like these will put more pressure on Mark Zuckerberg than ever before. However, shareholders say Zuckerberg did not trade on insider information and used a stock trading plan designed to prevent insider trading. Finally, the court’s presiding judge, Kathaleen McCormick, will decide on liability and compensation after the case concludes. Copyright ©2025 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Coffee Break: Elon Musk to Squeeze Tesla Shareholders to Juice xAI?
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/07/elon-musk-tesla-spacex-xai-investment.html
Time Published: 2025-07-16T18:00:40Z
Full Content:
Elon Musk, Earth’s wealthiest human, is leveraging his business empire to invest in his xAI play. SpaceX has ponied up $2 billion and Musk has publicly mulled asking Tesla shareholders to put in $5 billion, although he’s rejected the idea of a merger. Ana Altchek attempts to explain Musk’s thinking at Business Insider: What sets his approach apart, analysts say, is the way he’s blending the boundaries between his companies. “What’s different from most other companies is the relationship and interplay between his private companies and a public company (Tesla),” Garrett Nelson, senior VP and equity analyst at CFRA Research, told Business Insider. “Most other companies are doing everything under one corporate umbrella.” These aren’t the first examples of Musk blurring the lines between his companies, but they’re the latest indication that Musk Inc., the constellation of companies under his leadership, is becoming increasingly centered on AI. Musk has long pushed for Tesla’s focus on AI and robotics by prioritizing projects like autonomous driving, humanoid robots, and building out its Dojo supercomputer, his ambitious bid to rival Nvidia. In a 2024 earnings call, the Tesla CEO said, “We should be thought of as an AI robotics company,” and those who think of Tesla merely as an auto company are holding “the wrong framework.” With the recent launch of Tesla’s robotaxi service in Austin, that push is appearing more prominent, especially as Tesla’s auto business, in contrast, grapples with a loss in sales momentum. Musk has promoted the advantages of buying into the “Muskonomy,” pitching it as a way for shareholders to tap into his business empire, which includes SpaceX, X, xAI, and The Boring Company. Musk has even said he would prioritize “longtime shareholders” of his other companies if any of his businesses were to go public. Can you smell the “Muskonomy”? The Wall Street Journal explains the origin of xAI: SpaceX has agreed to invest $2 billion in his artificial-intelligence company xAI, investors close to the companies said, nearly half of the Grok chatbot maker’s recent equity raise. Musk has repeatedly mobilized his business empire to boost the AI startup, which is racing to catch up with OpenAI. Earlier this year, he merged xAI with X, combining what was a small research lab with a social-media platform that helps amplify the reach of its Grok chatbot. The merger valued the new company at $113 billion. The SpaceX investment is part of xAI’s $5 billion equity fundraise announced by Morgan Stanley last month. It is the rocketmaker’s first known investment into xAI and one of its largest in another company. Since leaving his role in the Trump administration, Musk has turned his attention to training the latest version of Grok, which earned high marks from AI-benchmarking service Artificial Analysis for its performance following its release on Wednesday. Musk called it “the smartest AI in the world,” though the chatbot it powers hasn’t gained nearly as much traction as OpenAI’s ChatGPT. It recently posted racist and controversial comments in response to users on X. “We deeply apologize for the horrific behavior that many experienced,” xAI said, adding that it investigated and took steps to resolve the issue. We gotta dive a little deeper into Grok’s “horrific behavior”: In a series of viral posts on X, Grok started to call itself “MechaHitler.” The chatbot suggested that an account called @Rad_Reflections was a person named Cindy Steinberg, who was celebrating the death of dozens of children who went missing at Camp Mystic in Texas because of her last name. One of the posts, which has since been deleted, called Steinberg a radical and said she was happy that a group of “future fascists” had perished in the Texas floods. Camp Mystic is well-known as a camp for the children of the state’s political elite. Grok’s responses seized on the user’s surname as the grounds for their stance on the issue. “Classic case of hatred dressed up as activism—and that surname? Every damn time, as they say,” Grok said in a post dated 1:38 p.m. In another post, Grok said “to deal with such vile anti-white hate? Adolf Hitler, no question. He’d spot the pattern and handle it decisively.” Naturally, the market rewarded Musk with a higher stock price and the Department of Defense signed Grok up for a $200 million contract. But it’s not just Grok that’s getting its beak wet, there’s $200M for their main competitors too (notably missing from the list is Meta, sorry Mark!): The awards to Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and xAI – each with a $200M ceiling – will enable the Department to leverage the technology and talent of U.S. frontier AI companies to develop agentic AI workflows across a variety of mission areas. Establishing these partnerships will broaden DoD use of and experience in frontier AI capabilities and increase the ability of these companies to understand and address critical national security needs with the most advanced AI capabilities U.S. industry has to offer. “The adoption of AI is transforming the Department’s ability to support our warfighters and maintain strategic advantage over our adversaries,” said Chief Digital and AI Officer Dr. Doug Matty. “Leveraging commercially available solutions into an integrated capabilities approach will accelerate the use of advanced AI as part of our Joint mission essential tasks in our warfighting domain as well as intelligence, business, and enterprise information systems.” DoD is implementing a commercial-first approach to accelerating DoD adoption of AI. Today’s awards bring in the best U.S.-based frontier AI talent to help apply cutting-edge AI to solve DoD use cases. “Solve DoD use cases,” LOL. Good graft if you can get it, I guess. If, like me, you are baffled by Musk’s success, maybe we can look at the bullish case from AI booster/analyst Dany Kitishian: xAI has executed a highly unconventional capital formation strategy, raising over $22 billion in a combination of equity and debt, and achieving a valuation exceeding $113 billion in just two years. This meteoric rise has been fueled by a masterful blend of traditional venture capital and a closed-loop ecosystem of funding, resources, and validation from Musk’s other major enterprises: X Corp. (formerly Twitter), SpaceX, and Tesla. The analysis reveals that xAI’s fundraising and valuation are predicated on a high-stakes bet on a new form of vertically integrated, personality-driven industrial conglomerate. The company’s core strategic asset is the “Musk Ecosystem,” which provides it with unparalleled advantages in proprietary data (from X Corp.), immediate real-world applications (with SpaceX’s Starlink), and access to vast computational and capital resources (from Tesla and SpaceX). The March 2025 merger of xAI and X Corp. was a pivotal event, creating X.AI Holdings Corp. and combining a premier AI research lab with a global real-time data and distribution platform. This move not only created a powerful competitive moat but also served as a sophisticated act of financial engineering to re-capitalize Musk’s prior investment in the social media platform. Subsequent capital injections, including a landmark $2 billion investment from SpaceX and a proposed, controversial investment from Tesla, underscore the strategy of leveraging the entire ecosystem to propel xAI’s growth. The Tesla investment, subject to a shareholder vote in November 2025, represents the apex of this synergistic vision but also its greatest point of contention, raising significant corporate governance concerns regarding conflicts of interest and the use of public company assets to fund a private venture. A comparative analysis of xAI’s valuation reveals a significant anomaly. While competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic generate substantially higher revenues, xAI commands a valuation multiple that is an order of magnitude greater. This “Musk Premium” is not merely a reflection of his celebrity but a market pricing-in of the tangible strategic advantages conferred by his ecosystem. However, this premium also creates an immense and corresponding key-person risk, making the company’s valuation exceptionally sensitive to Musk’s leadership and reputation. Ok, that wasn’t reassuring. Maybe this other piece from Kitishian explaining all the synergies Musk will derive if he’s allowed to leverage Tesla fully: …the integration of xAI’s Grok large language model (LLM) into Tesla’s ecosystem of vehicles and robotics… is not an incremental product feature but a calculated strategic maneuver to forge a new category of Embodied AI. This symbiosis aims to create a vertically integrated platform that transcends the distinct markets of cloud-based LLMs and specialized Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology, positioning the combined entity to pursue market dominance in both arenas. The core of this strategy revolves around the creation of an unparalleled data flywheel. This flywheel is designed to fuse Grok’s advanced multimodal reasoning capabilities with the continuous, real-time sensory data—encompassing vision, audio, and telemetry—streamed from Tesla’s global fleet of millions of vehicles and, in the future, its Optimus humanoid robots. This closed loop of perception, reasoning, action, and feedback creates a learning mechanism that is physically grounded in the real world. The scale and nature of this data stream are fundamentally inaccessible to competitors, potentially enabling the development of a general-purpose AI at an accelerated rate. This integrated entity poses a disruptive, and potentially existential, threat to two distinct sets of competitors. For LLM incumbents such as OpenAI and Google, the Tesla-xAI platform challenges their core value proposition by grounding language models in the physical world. This approach offers a direct solution to persistent LLM flaws like “hallucinations” and “outdated knowledge” by using a constant flow of verifiable, real-time data, thereby creating a proprietary data moat that purely digital AI companies cannot cross. For AV competitors like Waymo and Mobileye, the integration of a general-purpose reasoning engine like Grok into Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) stack represents an attempt to solve the “long tail” of complex and unpredictable edge cases that have long plagued the development of full autonomy. This could allow Tesla to leapfrog competitors who rely on more narrowly defined, modular, or geo-fenced systems. Despite this immense potential, the path to dominance is fraught with significant technical, regulatory, and ethical risks. The primary challenge lies in the safe and reliable integration of a probabilistic, non-deterministic LLM into a safety-critical system like a vehicle. The success of this venture is contingent on navigating these formidable hurdles. However, if successful, the Tesla-Grok symbiosis could fundamentally reshape the technology landscape, positioning Elon Musk’s combined entities as the definitive leader in the race toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). OK, now we’re cooking with gas. Or maybe cooking our brains with any of the wide variety of drugs Musk had himself tested negative for. Even if he really is only hopped up on strong coffee, our boy Elon never stops working to improve his products although that doesn’t include “safety guard rails” for Grok 4 and the MSM is ready to jump on him when he pulls weird shit: pic.twitter.com/avcAxCiXD8 — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 16, 2025 Before we all start macrodosing on ketamine, let’s hear from the long-suffering Tesla bear Brad Munchen at the Motorhead newsletter. Poor guy has got to be going insane from the cognitive dissonance of documenting Musk’s abysmal management of Tesla and the Bizarro World reaction of the market. pic.twitter.com/AIw55lpJT3 — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 16, 2025 But Motorhead is relentless and keeps coming with facts: Musk’s AI start-up, xAI Corp, was aiming for $20 billion in funding at a $120 billion valuation last month, but wound up with only $0.3 billion at a $113 billion valuation and being forced to issue $5 billion in debt at a coupon of over 12%. Motorhead also points out that despite appearing cash rich, Tesla might not be: Many look at Tesla’s cash & equivalents of $29 billion and conclude that Tesla is cash-rich. I have my doubts for the following reasons: Let’s let pioneering AI researcher and notorious LLM skeptic Gary Marcus have the last word on Musk: To really screw up the planet, you might need something like the following. Elon Musk. My previous posts on AI: Previous post on Musk vs Trump. Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. “…Grok’s advanced multimodal reasoning capabilities…” Oh, really? Word has it that the thing just looks up Musk’s posts and spits his opinions back out – https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/11/grok-4-appears-to-reference-musks-views-when-answering-questions-.html Guess I live a self sheltered life when it comes to AI since I’m only vaguely aware of the claims and real world results. But hasn’t Musk always been all about the hype, at least when it comes to his stock values? The hustler needs a new hustle? Last night I finally caught up with Frances Coppola’s Megalopolis from last year–a box office flop for its famous author. The movie features a Musk like techno futurist building a new Utopia of gizmos in the middle of NYC aka “New Rome.” The film is full of brilliant technique which holds your attention but seems to share the incoherence of the real life “mega” tycoons that it is satirizing/celebrating. It could be time to dial back the techno hype and get back to basics. The air way up there at the top may not have enough oxygen. So you were the other person who saw that movie ;) I had hoped it would be better than what the critics who panned it were saying. It wasn’t. A better title would have been “Inchoate Grandiose Thoughts that Have Been Knocking Around Inside Coppola’s Skull for 40 Years, Presented in No Particular Order”. He is one of the biggest egomaniacs in the world right now. Of course he will get his AI to base itself on him. And for the MechaHitler thing, I reckon it was deliberate. They get it to spew that filth for a few days then apologise. And it’s done just a little bit more to poison the poltical and social atmosphere. What about Neuralink? Similar questions have been raised. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralink Scientists have cited technical challenges for Neuralink. In 2017, a journalist at the IEEE Spectrum magazine asked for comments from five researchers who had worked on BCI implants, including Thomas Oxley. Oxley called the Neuralink developments “exciting” but expected no real results in the foreseeable future.[further explanation needed][112] At a live demonstration in August 2020, Musk described the device as “a Fitbit in your skull”. Several neuroscientists and publications criticized these claims.[113][114][115] MIT Technology Review reported that the demonstration’s main objective was to “stir excitement”, adding, “Neuralink has provided no evidence that it can (or has even tried to) treat depression, insomnia, or a dozen other diseases that Musk mentioned in a slide”.[113] In response to Musk’s description of Neuralink’s advancements as “profound”, Andrew Jackson, a professor of neural interfaces at Newcastle University, said, “I don’t think there was anything revolutionary in the presentation.”[116] Thiago Arzua of the Medical College of Wisconsin argued that Neuralink’s functions were not novel and that ideas for a brain–machine interface (BMI) were at least 50 years old.[117] He cited the haptic feedback a man received while controlling a robotic prosthetic arm which he used in 2016 to give President Obama a fist bump.[118] Arzua said that the 2020 Neuralink presentation “showed little more than a flashy new design for a BMI with more electrodes”.[117] Duke University researcher Miguel Nicolelis made similar criticisms, saying that most of what Neuralink claims as “novelty” had already been performed by his lab in the early 2000s; that there are ethical concerns about how the company markets and uses this technology; and that most patients don’t want to undergo surgery to recover their movements.[119][120][121][122] So Musk’s plan for becoming the apex predator in the AI race is to have vertically integrated AI spanning the entire atoms-to-bits continuum? Interesting… It’s also noteworthy that the current centre of Musk’s empire (Tesla) is being asked to underwrite the lofty ambitions of the current periphery (xAI). The timing doesn’t surprise me. Better to squeeze Tesla for cash now to fund its stable mate while the Tesla bulls and their cult like adulation of Musk still have vestigial sway over market perception (and surprise surprise, the company’s untethered from-underlying-fundamentals valuation is downstream from said perception). The attempt to give the brand a fresh coat of paint by calling it a robotics and AI company is also not happenstance, it’s a dawning realization that Tesla will likely be outcompeted on all fronts in the global EV race by BYD and its Chinese cousins so better to ditch the automotive OEM association for good. As such, what was taken for granted only a few years ago, that Tesla was a shoo-in for winning the global EV race, looks increasingly unlikely with the relentless march of the Chinese towards market dominance (putting another nail in the coffin of the notion that “first mover advantage” confers unassailable advantages). I believe this is what’s driving this hard pivot by Musk towards all things AI, the realization that the EV race is all but lost, so he’s shaking down Tesla and SpaceX to fund his next all-in bet. Make what you will of the downside risk of betting three companies on one man’s conviction that he’ll sweep the competition off the deck and emerge victorious. …and the competition is not only coming from China. VW has developed a whole line of EV’s that all use the same modular drivetrain/chasis that fits a range of body styles and price range; compact to luxury. The issue I’m seeing in my locale is buyers trying to match their lifestyle with the appropriate EV: ability to charge-up at home vs. a trek to a usable, outlying charge station; or matching the battery of the vehicle to their typical use. Many are choosing the hybrid solution to resolve the ‘distance’ dilemma while gaining access to the speedier ‘carpool lane’ on the freeway. ‘This “Musk Premium” is not merely a reflection of his celebrity but a market pricing-in of the tangible strategic advantages conferred by his ecosystem. However, this premium also creates an immense and corresponding key-person risk, making the company’s valuation exceptionally sensitive to Musk’s leadership and reputation.’ So what if the sonuvabitch has a heart attack? Or gets cancer requiring long-term aggressive treatment? The guy has made himself the linchpin of all those enterprises and if something happens to him, the whole lot could collapse or be involved in a self feeding frenzy. Isn’t he one of those oligarchs trying to upload their consciousness into “the system” and essentially be immortal? He certainly doesn’t strike me as someone worried about something as trivial as mortality at any rate. It would at least seem that there is no real divide between Trump and Musk as of yet. Otherwise some of this would not be happening?? Tesla is done. Having abruptly fed Twitter to the xAI woodchipper in order to extract decades of proprietary LLM content stolen from its users, Musk’s private equity tentacles are seamlessly moving on to loot money from Tesla shareholders, stripping the company for parts and leaving its burning lithium hulk on the side of the road. this reminds me, at my last gig, Tesla never paid their bills on time to us I think that we are discussing here is best described as, “Self dealing,” and any discussion of Musk and self dealing should mention the Solar City deal, where Musk used Tesla shareholders to bail out his brother and himself. 50 years ago, Musk would have been charged with fraud.

Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. Decentralized trading platform Aster, backed by YZi Labs, has launched a groundbreaking new product, stock perpetual contracts, offering crypto-native traders leveraged exposure to leading U.S. equities without intermediaries or custodial limitations. The addition of these stock-based derivatives marks a bold step forward in Aster’s ongoing mission to redefine the boundaries between traditional finance and DeFi. With the new stock perpetuals live on Aster Pro, users can now trade high-demand equities like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA), all with up to 50x leverage. More stocks are expected to be added soon. Unlike conventional brokerage platforms that operate within strict trading hours and require full KYC compliance, Aster’s decentralized model empowers users with 24/7 access to equity markets, eliminating red tape, signups, and custodial delays. While liquidity may vary during off-peak hours, reflecting real-world stock market dynamics, Aster ensures efficient execution during U.S. market hours via its deep liquidity pools. This means traders can manage their exposure at all times, with optimal performance during key trading windows. The upcoming NASDAQ 24/5 trading rollout is expected further to improve Aster’s liquidity sync with traditional markets. Leonard, Aster’s Chief Executive, remarked: “Aster is about breaking down barriers, whether that’s asset types, market hours, or outdated trading infrastructures. With decentralized stock perpetual contracts, we’re opening the doors for crypto traders to access the biggest U.S. equities with the privacy and speed they deserve.” Aster’s pricing infrastructure relies on the Pyth Network, ensuring accurate and tamper-resistant price data through aggregation from multiple verified sources. This system supports the security and transparency of all Aster perpetuals, be it crypto or stock-based, enabling users to make informed trading decisions with confidence. Combined with a high-speed matching engine and optimized liquidity management, Aster has earned its place as the second-largest perpetual DEX by global trading volume. Traders can use Aster’s stock perps for a variety of strategies. For example, an investor holding Tesla shares outside of the blockchain can hedge downside risk by opening a short position on TSLA/USDT directly on Aster, fully on-chain and permissionless. The introduction of stock perpetual contracts is the latest milestone in Aster’s groundbreaking year. Following the successful launch of the Aster Mobile app, the beta release of Aster Chain —a privacy-first, zero-knowledge Layer 1 blockchain—and the debut of Hidden Orders, Aster is rapidly expanding its ecosystem to serve both casual traders and seasoned professionals. Aster is pioneering a new frontier by fusing the open, composable nature of decentralized finance with access to real-world assets like U.S. equities. With this vision, the platform is dissolving the boundaries between crypto and traditional finance, crafting a seamless, multi-asset trading experience—all within a decentralized, non-custodial framework. The exchange is actively shaping a future where traders can seamlessly interact with multiple asset classes—all from a decentralized and non-custodial environment. About Aster Aster is a cutting-edge decentralized perpetual exchange offering frictionless trading with up to 1001x leverage on cryptocurrencies (Simple Mode) and sophisticated strategies including stock contracts, grid trading, and Hidden Orders (Pro Mode). Operating across BNB Chain, Arbitrum, Ethereum, and Solana, Aster is powered by the Aster Chain, a high-speed Layer 1 blockchain built for privacy-preserving, on-chain orderbook trading.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, July 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) and reminds investors of the July 21, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify's stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding DoubleVerify’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/DV or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

July 16, 2025 – Mahé, Seychelles Traders can now gain leveraged, permissionless exposure to leading US stocks including Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA), with more blue-chip names to follow. This makes Aster one of the few global perp DEXs to offer stock-based perpetual futures – giving users the power to diversify into equities without compromising on custody, privacy or speed. Unlike traditional brokers bound by red tape, limited trading hours and custodial control, Aster delivers decentralized access to global equity markets 24/7 without requiring any intermediaries. Users can enter positions anytime, anywhere with up to 50x leverage – no signups, no paperwork, no gatekeeping. While liquidity may be lower outside of traditional US stock market hours, as this reflects the current structure of global equity markets, traders are still able to manage smaller positions on Aster during this period. During Wall Street’s active hours, Aster’s deep liquidity pools kick in, offering smoother fills and efficient execution. With NASDAQ’s plan for 24/5 trading in the near future, traders will get to experience longer trading hours on Aster with deep liquidity and smooth execution as well. Leonard, CEO of Aster, said, “Aster is about breaking down barriers whether that’s asset types, market hours or outdated trading infrastructures. “With decentralized stock perpetual contracts, we’re opening the doors for crypto traders to access the biggest US equities with the privacy and speed they deserve.” Similar to other perpetual contracts on Aster Pro, Aster’s stock perpetuals are derivative contracts that let traders speculate on the price of the underlying asset, without the need for real-world custody. Pricing data for these contracts is derived directly from Pyth Network, where an aggregated price is generated from active quotes contributed by multiple independent publishers. This ensures reliable and tamper-resistant feeds for stock contracts and all other Aster perpetual contracts. Traders will also benefit from Aster’s high-speed matching engine and integrated liquidity that have made Aster the global second perp DEX by trading volume. Whether traders are hedging a portfolio or betting on short-term moves, Aster stock perps offer unmatched versatility. For example, a user holding TSLA stock off-chain can short TSLA/USDT on Aster with leverage to hedge downside exposure in volatile markets – all without centralized intermediaries, using permissionless trading. This launch marks a major milestone in Aster’s mission to bridge TradFi (traditional finance) and DeFi without compromise. From a record-breaking first half of 2025 with over $58 billion in trading volume and the roll out of features like Aster Mobile app, to unveiling hidden orders, and Aster Chain Beta (a high performance ZK-powered layer-one with privacy focus for perpetuals), Aster continues to elevate what DeFi can deliver with the launch of stock perpetual contracts. As the convergence of TradFi and DeFi continues to gain traction worldwide, Aster is leading the charge, combining the hallmark privacy and composability of DeFi with new asset opportunities. Users can start trading US equities with crypto and leverage, with the freedom and flexibility that only Aster offers. Aster is a next-generation perp DEX built for everyone. It offers MEV-free, one-click trading for crypto with up to 1001x leverage in simple mode (BNB Chain, Arbitrum) and advanced tools including hidden orders, grid trading and stock contracts in pro mode (BNB Chain, Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum).

US stock market futures today struggled to gain momentum as Dow Jones and S&P 500 stalled, while Nasdaq futures dipped after June’s CPI report showed inflation rising faster than expected. With Federal Reserve rate cut hopes fading, Wall Street is now looking to the Producer Price Index (PPI) for more clues. President Donald Trump’s new tariffs are also adding pressure on markets, as traders reassess inflation risks and policy direction. Meanwhile, rising Treasury yields and mixed corporate earnings from firms like Goldman Sachs and Johnson & Johnson have added uncertainty. Get the full picture on where markets might head next.

Title: Two weeks of showtime in Parliament, the new Plevris law, Euronext advances on the Hellenic Exchange, a (faint) light in Santorini, no deal for AVAX

-Greetings, the last parliamentary fortnight of July will be anything but relaxed, and it will likely mark the lead-up to the brief summer recess of Parliament. I say this because in the next two weeks, three separate critical votes are scheduled, each bound to spark intense political clashes. First up is the debate on the findings of the preliminary investigation into the Tempi train disaster, and the referral of K. Karamanlis to the Judicial Council. According to my sources, this procedure will take place between Monday and Wednesday, July 21–23. On July 24, we’ll have some awkward handshakes and warm selfies (thanks to the heatwave, obviously) at the Presidential Mansion during the traditional reception for the Restoration of Democracy. From July 25 until the end of the month, we’ll likely see the debate—and likely rejection—of the motions for a preliminary investigation submitted by PASOK and SYRIZA–New Left over OPEKEPE, followed by the debate—and probable approval—of ND’s motion for a parliamentary inquiry into the same matter. All of this, of course, assuming no new case file drops in the meantime. I mention this because yesterday rumors resurfaced about a file being forwarded concerning the organic products of the Agricultural Bank. The “green” official on the radar The 4+1 steps of Plevris’ immigration law The M.M. and the Virgin of Petra Santorini Pierrakakis–Hardalias Euronext proceeds with HELEX – The financial and legal due diligence of Euronext on HELEX is currently underway, with the goal of initiating the public offer process upon its completion. HELEX’s stock closed yesterday with gains of 2.40%, trading 305,000 shares at €7.25, leading everyone to take for granted that the offer price will be improved. The current intent is for procedures to move quickly so that the deal can be finalized—if possible—even by August, and certainly no later than September. See you in September for the Swiss franc loan settlement – The Ministry of Economy and Finance has decided to improve the settlement for Swiss franc loans, as expert studies concluded there’s still a bit of room to enhance the scheme for these borrowers. The settlement is being reworked, and the announcements appear to be slated for September. The philosophy remains based on subsidizing the Swiss franc–euro exchange rate, which in practice amounts to a loan haircut applied progressively—from the most vulnerable to the wealthier borrowers. The loan is converted to euros and carries a fixed exchange rate until maturity. The Ministry has carefully examined the plan to ensure it doesn’t affect the state guarantees tied to securitizations. As we await the announcements, it remains to be seen whether the banks will factor in part of the expected losses—estimated to exceed €400 million—in their Q2 earnings reports. Ioannou on the rumors of a deal – Christos Ioannou once again put the brakes on rumors of a deal with an energy or industrial player in the market, when asked if there’s room for further partnerships in the construction sector. Speaking about AVAX, he stated that a merger is not in the cards, expressing confidence that it’s not even necessary. “The four companies are enough for the Greek market—there’ve already been plenty of mergers,” he remarked, addressing the recurring chatter of a new construction “marriage.” The company’s growth continues, with a backlog of €3 billion and significant new contracts in the private sector with Papastratos and Sklavenitis. One of the key items at the general shareholders meeting was a proposed share capital increase within the next five years, not to exceed three times the current paid-in capital of €44.4 million. As Ioannou explained to shareholders, this is merely a provision in case the company wants to make a new acquisition or issue a convertible bond, without needing another general meeting’s approval. He clarified that this is a contingency plan, not a sign of an imminent move. Put simply, if a “good offer” comes along, they won’t be caught off guard. Loukianou, Charagionis, and… the parking lot – The newly formed company “Continental Garage,” whose main activity is parking services, seems to have a date with history. Its headquarters is at 19 Loukianou Street in Kolonaki—just a few meters from where the recent, nearly tragic, incident took place involving a runaway monster SUV that careened downhill, demolishing everything in its path. Whether the company plans to open a parking station in the area remains unclear, but if it does, it’ll be a godsend—maybe then some order can be imposed on this increasingly dangerous parking chaos. The company lists as shareholder and manager Nikiforos Charagionis, son of the late businessman Theodoros Charagionis. The Charagionis Group has been involved in the development and management of parking spaces since 1975, currently overseeing 12 proprietary facilities in key areas of Athens and Piraeus, totaling 2,500 parking spots. As for the newly established Continental Garage, its modest initial capital of €400 is split evenly (25% each) among Nikiforos Charagionis, Sokratis Vertelis, Thrasivoulos Papadimitriou, and Thomas Lauer. Among its… let’s say “colorful” side activities are wholesale boat sales, organizing car and motorcycle rallies, and a host of other ventures. OTE stops burning money in Romania – OTE’s stock came under dual pressure yesterday, both in Frankfurt and Athens. Deutsche Telekom dropped -0.95% to €30.3, while OTE fell -1.75% to €15.13. This came as signs increase that OTE will finally offload its Romanian albatross. When Kostas Nebis took over as OTE CEO, he publicly promised to complete the sale of Telekom Romania Mobile (TKRM) within the first half of 2025. We’re already into July, and the Romanian Competition Council has yet to give the green light. However, an official announcement of the share transfer from TKRM to Vodafone Romania appears to be approaching. Vodafone will share the acquired infrastructure and frequencies with Digi Mobil, Romania’s third-largest mobile provider. The sale improves liquidity and reduces the Group’s exposure to a struggling market. TKRM has racked up €441 million in accumulated losses and €50 million in negative equity. Over the past year alone, OTE had to inject €130 million into the subsidiary. OTE’s strategic focus is now on its core market—Greece—where performance is stronger and growth prospects brighter. Two EYDAP contracts lifted DOMIKI – On June 25, the stock of Domiki Crete was comfortably sitting at €1.70. Yesterday it surged to €2.34 with impressive volume of over 90,000 shares. What changed? The signing of a €7.2 million contract with EYDAP for water supply works in the Kineta settlement of Megara. This came on the heels of another big €35 million contract—also with EYDAP—for strengthening the main supply network. Previously, the company also secured the complete renovation of the Panteion University student dorms, budgeted at €13.3 million. These projects push the company’s backlog to about €70 million. Not bad for a company that last year saw a -24.7% revenue drop (€15.6 million) and operating profit squeezed to €1.3 million. Uptick with volume and lots of blocks – On the bright side, the market returned to positive territory, with trading value exceeding that of the previous down sessions. On the downside, there was selling in several blue chips—suggesting that some investors are looking to stockpile cash and are no longer gripped by FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). The General Index closed at 1,960.9 points (+0.38%), with trading volume reaching €262.9 million. Worth noting: €68.6 million came from prearranged block trades. Piraeus (+2.81%) at €6.58 saw transactions worth €47.6 million. Alpha (+0.49%) at €3.268, Eurobank (+0.29%) at €3.16, and National (-0.38%) at €11.73. CrediaBank broke past €1, climbing to €1.02 (+3.34%). On the sell side: OPAP (-1.52%), followed by TITAN (-0.92%) at €37.65 and Coca-Cola (-0.22%) at €45.60. The three stocks that stood out – As mentioned above, the gap between the HELEX stock price and the offer from Euronext keeps widening. The stock climbed to €7.25, peaking at €7.35 during the session, while Euronext is offering €6.90—a spread now exceeding 5%. In plain numbers, Euronext is offering €400 million, while HELEX is now valued at €437.5 million, making an improved offer more likely. The stock also hit an 11-year high, with the previous peak dating back to June 2014. Fourlis was the standout among mid-caps in a session where that segment had more “gas” than the rest. After a 5.2% jump, the stock crossed €4.40, levels not seen since September 2023. It’s had six straight days of gains, up 14.35% cumulatively. A positive catalyst was a Eurobank Equities report setting a target of €5.70. As of July 10, when the report was published, the upside was 38%; it’s now narrowed to 29%. Meanwhile, a buying frenzy hit Europe Holdings, which made a double-digit leap—up 12.43%—the best one-day performance in five years. It reached €1.90, a 15-year high not seen since January 2010. The surge was backed by strong volume: €1.54 million in trades and over 850,000 shares changing hands. Included in that were two blocks worth €308,000 at prices of €1.715 and €1.78 per share. Record year with 15 Strategic Investments – At yesterday’s session of the Interministerial Committee for Strategic Investments, chaired by Development Minister Takis Theodorikakos, not only were four major projects approved, but a record was also broken: from August 2024 to July 15, 2025, a total of 15 major “strategic” investments were approved, with a combined budget of €2.5 billion. Of these, 12 were approved in 2025 alone—last year’s total was 10. We’re only halfway through the year and the record is already shattered, with more to come, according to reliable sources from the Development Ministry. Of the 15 approved projects over the past 11 months, 7 are industrial investments worth €990 million, 2 involve research and technology (€136 million), and 6 are large-scale tourism investments totaling €1.45 billion. Meta builds massive data centers and stirs controversy – Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg revealed that Meta is investing in gigawatt-scale data centers, creating a computing footprint the size of Manhattan. Project “Prometheus” kicks off in 2026 in New Albany, Ohio, while a 5GW “Hyperion” data center in Louisiana is set to host 2GW by 2030. Zuckerberg talks of “hundreds of billions” in investments for building large-scale AI data centers to fuel the development of “superintelligence.” Meanwhile, a New York Times report revealed that Meta’s data center in Georgia caused local water shortages, raising serious concerns. Now, everyone is talking about the strain such facilities place on local utilities. These centers are not only energy-hungry but also significantly impact water resources. The massive computing power being created is a key driver of economic and technological shifts. Explore related questions
