Title: Elon Musk hates OpenAI's for-profit transformation plan. He's not the only one.

Sam Altman is attempting a thorny maneuver, transforming OpenAI from a subsidiary of a convoluted nonprofit into a more conventional business. Jungwon Byun knows what that's like. In 2023, the organization Byun cofounded, an AI lab named Ought, went through a similar transition. Launched in 2018, Ought built AI research tools and was structured as a nonprofit because its cofounders didn't expect AI to be commercially viable anytime soon, Byun said in an interview. Then ChatGPT launched, AI mania took hold, and the leadership team realized their structure might be a hindrance to raising capital and pursuing their mission. The decision was made to spin out Ought's core product, Elicit, as a for-profit company, along with most of its staff. Byun and several other executives set to lead the independent Elicit recused themselves from discussions, and a firm specializing in asset valuations was hired to independently appraise the value of Elicit so the remaining nonprofit, Ought, could be paid appropriately. (Byun declined to share the exact price, though she said Elicit chose to pay a premium on top of the recommended price.) OpenAI's planned transformation is on a far grander scale but faces similar questions and potentially more gnarly challenges. Altman wants to extricate OpenAI's revenue-generating business from its nonprofit parent, creating a more traditional company that can take in investments and give stock to shareholders who expect big returns. The process is complicated by OpenAI's complex corporate structure, the billions of dollars it has already raised from investors, and Elon Musk's attempts to block the deal. It's not just Musk though. A growing chorus of critics, including entrepreneurs, other companies and charities, investors, academics, and activists, say OpenAI may be about to make a grave mistake. Byun is one of them. "Artificial general intelligence is the most transformative technology of our lifetime, and OpenAI is absolutely at the frontier and one of the most important players in that," she told Business Insider. "So I think giving up governance rights to controlling the most important technology of our lifetime is an insanely huge decision and will affect all of humanity at a very great scale for a long time." Her advice to OpenAI's charitable parent organization: Do not sell to anyone. "I don't know, obviously, the details of what pressures they're under and what the details are of the options they're considering and how it affects the mission," Byun said. "But from what I can see, I absolutely would not sell those governance rights or give them up." OpenAI didn't respond to requests for comment over the past week. OpenAI was established as a nonprofit in 2015. Over time, its need for capital to pay for AI development prompted it to establish a for-profit subsidiary to raise venture funding and pursue business partnerships and revenue-generating products. This and various other subsidiaries are controlled by the nonprofit, which is controlled by a board of directors chaired by Bret Taylor, alongside Altman, Fidji Simo, Larry Summers, and other business luminaries. The board's main legal obligation is to further the nonprofit's charitable mission, which is to build "safe and beneficial artificial general intelligence for the benefit of humanity," rather than delivering returns to shareholders. OpenAI now seeks to transition to a more conventional corporate structure, turning the for-profit subsidiary into an independent public benefit company that controls "OpenAI's operations and business." PBCs are relatively common. This approach takes into account the interests of shareholders, other stakeholders, and the public. OpenAI has said that with investors taken care of, this will help the startup raise "necessary capital with conventional terms like others in this space." OpenAI said the remaining nonprofit would receive shares in the public benefit company "at a fair valuation determined by independent financial advisors." That may be the ultimate challenge — and one made more complex by potential conflicts of interest. OpenAI investors and others focused on the startup's business-focused future may prefer to pay the nonprofit less for its assets and control, leaving the new for-profit entity with more financial firepower. However, some of these people could be in positions to influence the valuation and decision-making. Musk, an OpenAI cofounder who acrimoniously split from Altman, has sued the startup over its plans. Musk and a group of other investors also made a bid in February to acquire the nonprofit parent OpenAI Inc. for $97.4 billion. That was more than half of the total value of the entire startup based on its most recent funding round. "It is in the public's interest to ensure that OpenAI, Inc. is compensated at fair market value," the Musk consortium said in a statement. "That value cannot be determined by insiders negotiating on both sides of the same table." Ellen Aprill, an expert on charities at the UCLA School of Law, said OpenAI's board has an obligation to make sure the nonprofit is getting a fair value for giving up its assets and control. "One of the very big issues is what is fair market value?" she told BI. "In particular, how much should the nonprofit get for giving up control? "Part of what Musk and his group were trying to do with this offer is to set at least some floor, some sense of what the fair market value would be," she added. "Putting it out for auction — let's see what people would pay." Taylor, the OpenAI board chairman, officially rebuffed Musk. "OpenAI is not for sale, and the board has unanimously rejected Mr. Musk's latest attempt to disrupt his competition," Taylor wrote in a statement. "Any potential reorganization of OpenAI will strengthen our nonprofit and its mission to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity." Days earlier, Altman shot the bid down with a post on X that mocked the struggles of the Musk-owned social network: "no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want." Altman's post prompted some discussion of whether he was, or should be, recused from this process. "When it comes to looking at a conflicted transaction like this one, it's much easier to satisfy the court's review if you take people who are on both sides of their transaction out of the negotiations," said Peter Molk, a law professor at the University of Florida. However, he noted that under Delaware law, Altman isn't legally required to remove himself. Molk also cautioned against recusing too early. "There's value in his being there. Along the way, he can provide useful insight and information that's actually useful for OpenAI, for the nonprofit, if they're going to go ahead with that process," Molk said. "You want to try and strike a balance that allows them to do their job, that helps a transaction occur in a way that's actually beneficial to all parties, but then have them take themselves out of the picture once you're beyond that point." The existing for-profit parts of OpenAI have already raised billions of dollars in pursuit of artificial general intelligence, or AGI, which the startup defines as systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work. This has raised hackles among some consumer advocates. Public Citizen, a consumer watchdog, has repeatedly assailed the AI startup, accusing it of betraying its nonprofit mission. "The nonprofit board has behaved as a subordinate to the for-profit, and has done nothing that evidences any commitment to the nonprofit mission," said Robert Weissman, the copresident of Public Citizen. He argued that the solution is to forcibly dissolve the nonprofit and auction off its assets for the benefit of a new independent charity not linked to the current OpenAI board. Meta, Facebook's parent company, raised similar concerns, writing to California's attorney general, Rob Bonta, in December to ask him to step in. "Taking advantage of this non-profit status, OpenAI raised billions of dollars in capital from investors to further its purported mission," the company wrote. "Now, OpenAI wants to change its status while retaining all of the benefits that enabled it to reach the point it has today. That is wrong. OpenAI should not be allowed to flout the law by taking and reappropriating assets it built as a charity and using them for potentially enormous private gains." In late January, a group of 25 charities, including one started by the eBay founder Pierre Omidyar and his wife, piled on. The coalition urged Bonta "to take prompt legal action to ensure that OpenAI's assets are not illegally diverted for private gain." Rose Chan Loui, a law professor at UCLA specializing in nonprofit and philanthropy law, is skeptical of the legal justifications for OpenAI's plan. She said the proposed changes would amount to a change in purpose for OpenAI's current nonprofit. To do that under Delaware law requires one of four criteria to be met: "We don't think any of those apply here," Chan Loui said. "We keep going back to — your purpose is not to be first in the race to AGI. Your purpose is to make sure that AGI is to protect, and ensure safe development of AGI." OpenAI's existing structure — a nonprofit that controls a for-profit subsidiary — is unusual, but by no means unheard of. The Mozilla Foundation, for example, owns a tech company, Mozilla Corporation, that produces the Firefox internet browser. "Nonprofit organizations can not only coexist with commercial enterprises but also challenge them to do better," a Mozilla spokesperson said in a statement. "Nonprofit commitments provide the kind of public interest compass we don't see enough of in tech." Another parallel comes from the healthcare sector. In the 1990s, in the face of mounting financial pressure, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association allowed its affiliated nonprofit plan organizations to transition to for-profit businesses. Many subsequently did so, to the chagrin of some. "The mission of the nonprofit in most Blue Cross Blue Shield plans was to provide affordable, accessible healthcare to people," a Consumers Union attorney told NPR in 2010. "And now the mission is to make money for stockholders." The most substantial threat to OpenAI's plans though, might not be Musk or other critics. The California and Delaware attorneys general are both making inquiries into the specifics of the transition. "The current beneficiaries of OpenAI have an interest in ensuring that charitable assets are not transferred to private interests without due consideration," Delaware's attorney general, Kathleen Jennings, said. AGs have meaningful legal powers to get involved. In 2002, Pennsylvania's attorney general intervened in a planned deal by the nonprofit foundation that controls the for-profit Hershey chocolate brand to sell its assets to Wrigley for $12 billion, citing the potential harm to the town of Hershey. The sale was ultimately called off. Jump to

Title: Hedge funds are trimming their Magnificent 7 holdings — here's what they're buying instead

Time Published: 2025-02-25T09:45:02Z

Hedge funds are making some adjustments to their tech-investing playbook. The Magnificent Seven stocks — which include Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta — contributed over 50% to the S&P 500's gains last year, but the biggest money managers in the market are increasingly looking to different parts of the market, according to Goldman Sachs' analysis of 695 hedge funds with $3.1 trillion of gross equity positions at the start of the first quarter of 2025. Despite remaining top holdings in Q4 of 2024, all of the Magnificent Seven stocks saw a net decrease in hedge fund ownership except for Tesla. The Magnificent Seven stocks have struggled so far this year. The group's year-to-date return has lagged behind the overall S&P 500 index, with every stock in the Magnificent Seven down in 2025 while the index is up 2.5%. One explanation for the underperformance is that the market is still trying to appropriately quantify DeepSeek's impact. The Magnificent Seven is planning to continue its aggressive AI capex spend for a total of $280 billion in aggregate expenditures, up 34% year over year. Investors are increasingly scrutinizing if those dollars are resulting in tangible results, especially when DeepSeek uses a fraction of the cost. "Price reactions suggest growing concerns around monetization vs. capex for hyperscalers, with Meta the only one rising on earnings," Savita Subramanian, head of US equity and quantitative strategy for Bank of America, wrote in a recent note. While the Magnificent Seven stocks are still hedge funds' largest holdings, the funds have increased their exposure to the healthcare and communication services sectors, upping their existing overweights by 135 and 118 basis points, respectively, last quarter, Goldman Sachs said. Healthcare stocks underperformed in 2024, gaining just 2%, but they've had a strong start to 2025, with the sector up 6% year to date. The sector is sensitive to government regulation, so it could be in for some volatility in 2025 if existing healthcare policies change, the bank said. Goldman Sachs identified UnitedHealth Group (UNH) as one of last quarter's "Rising Stars," or stocks with the largest increase in the number of hedge fund investors. In communication services, Walt Disney Company (DIS) was another Rising Star. Hedge funds are still bullish on AI, but instead of only focusing on the Magnificent Seven, they're turning to "Phase 3," or companies with AI-enabled revenues. As the technology develops more use cases, the biggest winners will be the companies that use AI to boost productivity and grow revenue streams. Salesforce (CRM) and ServiceNow (NOW) were the top AI Phase 3 stocks among hedge funds last quarter, according to Goldman Sachs. Hedge funds also adjusted holdings last quarter to take advantage of the Trump trade, meaning they moved to cut back on stocks exposed to China and tariffs. Instead, hedge funds added potential deregulation beneficiaries and companies exposed to small businesses and domestic sales. The natural gas processing business Williams Companies (WMB) appeared on the Rising Stars list. While investors are exercising increased caution around the Magnificent Seven and financials, that doesn't mean that hedge funds are jumping ship entirely on those trades: Tesla (TSLA) and Robinhood Markets (HOOD) made the Rising Stars list. Especially within financials, while hedge funds may have cut back on their overall sector allocations, certain individual stocks did well. Hedge funds also believe Stifel Financial Corp (SF) is shaping to be a potential deregulation beneficiary under Trump. Jump to

Microsoft terminated select leases with at least two private data center operators across multiple U.S. markets, accounting for “a couple of hundred megawatts” of power, according to a copy of TD Cowen's report as cited by Bloomberg. For a perspective of how much power that is, 1 megawatt can power 250 homes during peak usage hours, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. “While we have yet to get the level of color via our channel checks that we would like into why this is occurring, our initial reaction is that this is tied to Microsoft potentially being in an oversupply position,” TD Cowen reportedly wrote. Artificial intelligence depends heavily on massive amounts of data, requiring increased computing power, greater storage, and faster network speeds—all of which data centers provide. However, newer open-source AI models like DeepSeek claim to operate at a fraction of the cost of their American rivals. AI developers may be reassessing where they put their money. An industry source familiar with the matter told Decrypt Microsoft’s pullback reflects a shift in OpenAI workloads toward competitors like Oracle. Oracle, Google, and Meta have all seen significant year-over-year growth in demand, while Amazon’s demand has remained steady. There are currently 3,317 data centers in the U.S. alone, according to figures from tracking website Data Center Map. Addressing questions about shifts in its data center approach, Microsoft reaffirmed its dedication to ongoing growth and infrastructure investments to satisfy rising customer demand. “While we may strategically pace or adjust our infrastructure in some areas, we will continue to grow strongly in all regions,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to Decrypt. "This allows us to invest and allocate resources to growth areas for our future.” Microsoft plans to spend $80 billion on “infrastructure” in 2025, the spokesperson said. “Microsoft is adjusting its data center usage targets over the coming years due to increased competition from other players launching new projects,” Blockspace Media co-founder Will Foxley told Decrypt. “Microsoft is still aggressively flexing its budget for data center growth, so I don't take the TD Cowen note as too noteworthy long term.” Foxley, the former Director of Media and Strategy at Compass Mining, noted that such cancellations or adjustments are common for large enterprises. "A company like Microsoft is likely negotiating globally for dozens of data centers simultaneously," he explained. “A few cancellations aren't especially surprising." In contrast, Foxley pointed out that the stakes for canceling data center leases could be significantly higher for Bitcoin miners. “Miners have less capital and operate under tighter timelines,” Foxley said. “That means cancellations can quickly lead to catastrophic outcomes.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk Disliked by Most Americans, Survey Shows

Republicans and Democrats are split on how they view Musk, while Americans of all political stripes have an unfavorable view of Meta’s boss Most Americans are not big fans of Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, the world’s two richest men, according to new survey data from Pew Research Center. The majority of respondents (54%) said they had an unfavorable view of Musk, including 36% saying they had a “very” unfavorable opinion of him. Musk — who owns X and is the boss of Tesla and SpaceX, among other companies — received a “favorable” vote from 42% of respondents. It is worth noting that Musk’s favorability differs wildly across party lines. Among respondents who said they leaned towards Democrats and left-leaning candidates, 85% of them said they disliked Musk; 73% of Republicans, on the other hand, had a favorable view of him. That does not come as much of a shock, considering Musk spent at least $250 million to help President Trump and other Republicans win elections last November. And Musk has been a key cog in Trump’s second administration, where he is spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE; Musk said last week he is aiming to trim at least $1 trillion in annual spending from the federal bureaucracy. The Meta CEO, meanwhile, is even more disliked than Musk, with 67% of Americans saying they have an unfavorable view of Zuckerberg. That distaste is shared among Democrats and Republicans, with 76% of left-leaning respondents saying they have an unfavorable view of Zuckerberg, and 60% of right-leaning respondents saying the same thing. Zuckerberg has had a notoriously up-and-down relationship with President Trump, whom he banned from Instagram and Facebook in early 2021, following the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. At the time, Zuckerberg said “the risks” of keeping him on the platforms were “simply too great.” Trump was later reinstated to those platforms in 2023. More recently, Zuckerberg has had a better rapport with the president. He donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration, and he was there in Washington, D.C. last month, alongside Musk and other tech executives like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Google chief Sundar Pichai. Despite that, most Trump fans in D.C. told TheWrap they remained skeptical of Zuckerberg’s sudden embrace of President Trump. Zuckerberg, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Tracker, has a net worth of $241 billion, making him the second richest person in the world. His net worth has received a nice boost recently, thanks to Meta’s stock price jumping 20% since early November. Musk, despite a recent decline for Tesla’s stock price, remains the world’s richest person with a net worth of $385 billion. Pew’s survey was conducted between Jan. 27 and Feb. 2 and included 5,086 respondents.

Title: Alibaba Places $52 Billion Price Tag on AI Plans

Last week, Chinese tech conglomerate Alibaba announced a major uptick in AI spending. Now, the company has put a price tag on the effort, according to a Monday (Feb. 24) report by Reuters: at least 380 billion yuan, or $52.44 billion, over a three-year period. During an earnings call last week, the company said it would spend more on artificial intelligence (AI) in the next three years than it has in the last 10, without providing an exact figure. The goal, management said, is to help Alibaba pursue artificial general intelligence (AGI), or a version of AI that can think and reason at or above the level of humans. “We aim to continue to develop models that extend the boundaries of intelligence. Why is that the primary aim?” Eddie Wu, the company’s CEO, said during the earnings call. “Well, it’s because all of the visible AI application scenarios today that we see around content creation, search and so on and so forth have arisen precisely as a result of the ongoing extension of those boundaries, and we want to keep pushing out those boundaries to create more and more opportunities.” As PYMNTS wrote earlier this year, developing AGI has become a goal for most of the world’s biggest tech players such as OpenAI, Google and Meta. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman “fanned the flames” — as that report put it — at the beginning of the year when he wrote on his blog that the company is “now confident we know how to build AGI” as the technology has been traditionally recognized. “Achieving AGI would have big implications for business. For example, one AI system can analyze market trends while simultaneously redesigning the supply chain to adapt to those changes,” PYMNTS wrote. “It can handle customer service while using those interactions to inform product development. It can manage operations while developing innovative solutions to efficiency problems. It can make strategic decisions by synthesizing information across multiple industries and domains, which requires high-level general reasoning.” The Reuters report notes that Alibaba has begun 2025 as “a winner in China’s AI race,” attracting investors with its business deals, and seeing its stock climb more than 68% this year. Perhaps the company’s most high-profile deal is the one it recently inked with Apple, to help that company develop an AI-powered iPhone for sale in China. Restrictions by the Chinese government require companies to have a local partner before launching AI products. For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

Title: Florida Sues Target Over Trans Merchandise

First Amendment Elizabeth Nolan Brown | 2.24.2025 10:00 AM Florida is suing Target for selling LGBTQ-friendly merchandise, something the state is misleadingly calling "efforts to sexualize children." You're probably thinking: Wait, doesn't the First Amendment stop the government from doing things like this? Doesn't Target have a First Amendment right to sell goods broadcasting whatever perfectly legal messages it chooses, and don't individual Americans have a First Amendment right to access those messages? The answer is a resounding: of course. But Florida authorities don't seem to care, so long as they get to perform concern for children. You are reading Sex & Tech, the newsletter from Elizabeth Nolan Brown on sex, technology, bodily autonomy, law, and online culture. Want more on sex, technology, and the law? Subscribe to Sex & Tech. It's free and you can unsubscribe any time. Δ What the state considers the "sexualization of children" seems to be anything discussing gender identity or acknowledging that transgender people exist. On X, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier listed three of the products that he objects to: "rainbow sports bras for boys," swimsuits for transgender children, and books about gender identity. Like many anti-trans crusaders, Uthmeier doesn't bother elaborating on how products concerned with gender identity—whether someone identifies as male or female or neither or both—are related to sexualization. He expects his audience to take it as a given that anything related to transgender or nonbinary identities is rooted in (deviant) sexuality. As has been pointed out many times before: In cases like this, it's the anti-trans crowd who are sexualizing children, applying their adult interpretations of gender and sex to things that are not inherently sexual. A girl saying she feels like a boy is not automatically expressing anything related to sexual feelings or preferences, nor is a teenager who likes to wear elements of masculine and feminine clothing necessarily making a sexual statement. Likewise, catering to a market of transgender and nonbinary minors is not an attempt to sexualize them. And Florida isn't only objecting to products designed for children. On the first page of its massive 163-page class action complaint, the state complains about Target having sold "transgender 'tuck-friendly' women's swimsuits with 'extra crotch coverage.'" Ari Cohn, who serves as lead counsel for tech policy at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, has called Florida's lawsuit "asinine, performative buffoonery and an attack on the First Amendment." The state, he noted, is objecting to products "based on the messages they convey—all of which are First Amendment–protected, and none of which 'sexualize children.'" You do have to give it to Florida authorities for creativity. Presumably aware that the state can't simply ban messages it finds distasteful, the state is trying to frame this not as a matter of censorship but as a matter of Target's corporate duty to shareholders. "Target's efforts to sexualize children caused its stock price to plummet, harming Florida's retirement fund and putting the retirements of our teachers and first responders at risk," Uthmeier said in his X post. Uthmeier accused the company of "misleading shareholders" and promoting "a harmful leftist agenda at the expense of shareholder returns." By this argument, the state could engage in all sorts of censorship so long as it bought shares in whatever companies it wanted to bully into cracking down on speech. It could even demand the suppression of certain messages on social media on in search results by buying shares in companies like Meta and Alphabet. "It's beyond question" that the products Uthmeier objects to Target having sold are "expressive items" protected by the First Amendment, noted Cohn. "That Florida's retirement fund holds shares of Target is irrelevant and meaningless. Government does not gain the power to regulate speech because it's a shareholder." If Florida thinks Target stock is a bad investment, it can divest itself of Target shares. It cannot use them as an excuse to say what sorts of perfectly legal messages the company may broadcast. Even if Florida could somehow sweep First Amendment issues aside, the state might not have much of a case. The new lawsuit, filed in federal court, "is one of at least three similar cases against Target in Florida," reports the Tallahassee Democrat. It claims that Target CEO Brian Cornell and the company's board of directors violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by failing to "oversee or disclose the obvious risks of Target's 2023 LGBT-Pride Campaign" and thus "deceived Target investors." In a previous Florida lawsuit against Target, the company disputed some similar claims. The company "repeatedly warned investors of the risk" that consumers might boycott over its initiatives, it said in a January 2024 filing in this case. Florida might be unhappy with "Target's business judgment about merchandising. But disagreeing with Target's business judgment does not give rise to an actionable claim under the securities laws." • Surrogacy is the new battlefield in reproductive freedom. • "Presenting people with more partisan video recommendations has no detectable polarizing effects on users' attitudes in the short term," according to a new study in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. "While we cannot rule out effects from long-term exposure or to small vulnerable subsets of users, our evidence is not consistent with prevailing popular narratives about YouTube recommendation systems radicalizing users en masse." • A new bill in Alabama would allow pregnant women to defer jail or prison sentences. "The woman would then serve a term of pre-incarceration probation under electronic supervision until 12 weeks after she gives birth," reports the Alabama Political Reporter. "That probation period would then be credited to the woman's sentence." • After Texas banned abortion in 2021, "the rate of sepsis shot up more than 50% for women hospitalized when they lost their pregnancies in the second trimester," reports ProPublica.

Title: Vimeo CEO Philip Moyer is betting on the human touch — and AI

AI tools are here to stay, Moyer says, but Vimeo wants to build on ‘authenticity.’ by Nilay Patel If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Today, I’m talking with Vimeo CEO Philip Moyer. You probably know Vimeo from its beginnings as an artsier, more creative competitor to YouTube. But over the last few years, and especially after it went public in 2021, Vimeo has really turned itself into an enterprise software company, selling video hosting services to companies of all sizes. And this episode is a particularly fun full-circle Decoder moment — I interviewed Philip’s predecessor, Anjali Sud, both when she was the CEO of Vimeo and again more recently in her new gig as CEO of Tubi. So it was fascinating to close the loop and see how Philip is changing Vimeo after taking over, especially as the entire ecosystem of online video is shifting so rapidly. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! Philip is pushing to make Vimeo a different kind of YouTube competitor, one that can support everything from independent creators to huge corporations. It’s a shift from the strategy Anjali used to reset the company and take it public, and there’s a lot of interesting nuance to it. Everyone wants to put videos on the internet, it turns out, but only some of those people want them to be ingested by YouTube’s advertising and recommendation systems. Philip himself has a ton of big tech experience: he’s worked at Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, and he’s deep in the weeds on both the tech and the business. You’ll hear us talk about Google’s business and YouTube in particular quite a bit in this one, but we also get into TikTok and what it means to have the incentives of algorithmic video platforms drastically influence both creators worldwide and the culture we all consume. Of course, we talked about AI, too, and how it’s upending every platform in different ways. Vimeo has been marketing itself as an “AI-powered video platform” lately, so I wanted to know what Philip is thinking about Vimeo’s creator-focused mission colliding with the pitfalls of AI-generated video. We also spent some time on the simple supply-and-demand math problem that seems like it will change the creator economy drastically in the years to come: that is, if the amount of video on the internet explodes because of AI while the total amount of time we can spend watching video remains relatively fixed, how is anyone going to make any money at all? This is a fun one; I think you can really tell that Philip and I could have kept talking for a very long time. Okay, Vimeo CEO Philip Moyer. Here we go. This transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Philip Moyer, you are the CEO of Vimeo. Welcome to Decoder. Thank you, Nilay. It’s great to be here. I am very excited to talk to you. I have got to tell you, just structurally, this is one of the very first truly full-circle Decoder episodes. Because we had your predecessor Anjali on as CEO of Vimeo, and then we had her on in her new job as CEO of Tubi, and now we have you on as her replacement. Wow, it’s full circle. It’s full circle for a show that’s about structure, decision-making, and organizational culture — this is as good as it gets for me. So thank you so much for joining us. That’s fantastic. I have a lot of respect for Anjali and have to say a big thank you to her for all she built here, so it’s wonderful to hear. I’m very curious. Anjali was in the middle of executing a big pivot when we talked about Vimeo. People know Vimeo as what it started as — a consumer video service, kind of the art-ier competitor to YouTube. She pivoted it to a [software-as-a-service] business. She was very open: “This is now a SaaS company, we’re doing a lot of enterprise work, we’re a video hosting provider to a lot of people, we are a video creation tool for small businesses.” That was several years ago. I talked to her three years ago at Vimeo. You’re the new CEO. What do you think of Vimeo today? I think in a lot of ways, I mean a little bit of what she started, and a lot of what we’re continuing here, is going back to the roots of what Vimeo is known for. People came to us because, at the time, 20 years ago, it was hard to upload video. I kind of call that… I’ll say the second or third epoch of video was right around that time period when video files were getting bigger. It was hard to stream video. They were no longer just a single file. We were starting to get multiple formats. People came to us because of the quality of our transcoding and then, ultimately, our ability to be able to serve it directly to the person that was most important that they wanted to provide that video. And a lot of what we’re doing right now, and what we’ve taken that Anjali had started and extended pretty significantly is… It turns out that lots and lots of organizations and individuals around the world want to be able to keep a video private or they want to be able to serve it only to an intended audience. They don’t want to have someone collect data, they don’t want to have an algorithm that tries to send them down a rabbit hole. Instead, they want to just literally be able to provide that video. And so we’re seeing that video makes up about 82 percent of the world’s internet today and we’re seeing that same concept arrive with private individuals, doctors, educators, and large organizations. And so yes, I would say that what we’re really becoming now is… Our goal is to become the largest private video distribution platform in the world. We think that there’s an increasing demand for video that isn’t public or algorithm-driven, but instead, it could be very personal and delivered at the right moment, at the right time, to the right individual. Let me try to just understand that in context. There was the beginning of [shared video], right? You’re saying there are several epochs of [online] video. There’s the beginning, which was on iOS as a “send to YouTube” button at the operating system level because no one thought that public videos were a big deal. You just needed someplace to watch videos and YouTube was that. And then YouTube grew into the social media juggernaut it is now. TikTok exists, all that’s there, and the initial reaction was that it’s very hard to compete with that. “We’ll be for enterprises, business customers have video needs, we’ll service them.” Are you saying there’s some kind of middle ground, in the middle of the spectrum between big algorithmic consumer video platforms and enterprise, where just a lot of regular people want private video sharing? We have hundreds of thousands of school districts that use us. Teachers want students to be able to upload video assignments. Especially in a world of ChatGPT and AI, teachers want to see that the student is actually doing the assignment. We’ve got tens of thousands of medical professionals who want to be able to send a video to a patient without having some algorithm capture their disease state or the question that they have. We’ve got lots and lots of marketing organizations that want to be able to serve their video over to an individual inside of a big company, or to their client, and they don’t want it to be public. And then what we’re also finding is, on the YouTube front, organizations that were hosting entire YouTube sections on their website… YouTube is redirecting its customers over to some other place. I was meeting with a really large financial services company’s CEO and the chief economist. I took them to the website and I said, “Let me show you your chief economist speaking.” I clicked on the video, and before the video played, we had to watch some advertising on some Bitcoin or something. And on the right-hand side, it said, “Here’s how the top three credit rating organizations are trying to control the world. This is the video you should watch next.” And we’re just trying to watch the economist’s video. So organizations are getting tired of being redirected or having their data captured. A lot of organizations are starting to bypass what I call the big walled gardens, and in a lot of ways we’re back in the MSN and AOL era for websites. That’s where we are with video right now and people want to be able to go directly to their consumers. They want to be able to serve the message in an unfettered way, and then ultimately, they just want to be able to ensure the highest quality and the most personalized experience. We’re seeing tremendous demand for those kinds of scenarios. Again, it’s everything from the school teacher, the fitness instructor, and in some cases, the faith institution, all the way up to some of the biggest companies in the world — and I do mean that literally the biggest companies in the world are becoming customers. I think the thing that I’m keying on there is… there’s the consumer-facing video platforms and then you have a bunch of enterprise video needs and you’re in some way describing a bunch of core enterprise customers, right? Large school districts, and companies big enough to have a chief economist. I think those are classic enterprise customers and then somewhere in the middle, those companies actually want to reach consumers without participating in algorithmic media, and that consumer surface is what Vimeo has gotten away from. Are you saying you’re pushing back towards it? We get about 100 billion views of video a year on Vimeo, and only 20 percent of it is on Vimeo.com. We show up on e-commerce platforms. I was meeting with a physician, who is an independent practitioner, a fertility doctor, and he records a video before his patients come in and he sends that video over to his patients in the fertility clinic. So we have individual proprietors, people who want to be able to share a family video or something that they learned if they had been at a doctor’s visit or otherwise — so we have lots and lots of people that are using [the platform as] individuals. Now on the filmmaker side… What is most amazing to me right now is the sheer number of filmmakers that I have coming to me, and this has really started kicking up since I’ve become CEO. I would tell you it’s been a trend for about the past six months. I have so many filmmakers that are coming to me saying, “We don’t like the deal… We don’t like the deal that we have with the big studios. We don’t like the fact that if we go to YouTube, as an example, they take 45 cents of every advertising dollar. Or if we want to go onto one of the big platforms, they’ll take as much as 50 cents of every dollar. Is there a way for me to be able to sell tickets to my audience?” In some cases, some of these filmmakers that come to us have audiences that are bigger than they might get on one of those platforms and so we’re finding people who want to go direct. Our streaming business is like that. When you post on some of these big platforms… I really encourage people to look at the terms of service of the major consumer-based video platforms. It says in their terms of service that they’re able to monetize your content any way they want to. They can reuse your content, they can serve the content, and quite frankly, they’re capturing 45 cents of every dollar in that process. So a lot of these organizations want to be able to bypass those kinds of economics. So is that you building a consumer interface? You’re saying it’s only a small percentage that’s coming to Vimeo.com. Where are they finding an audience? Is it all on their own websites? Is it on other people’s platforms? Where is that audience actually going? It’s been interesting because there is this trend among streamers in particular where they’ll go to the large platforms, they’ll get some following, and then when they want to be able to serve premium content. That’s when they’ll come over and say, “We want to put SVOD. We want to be able to put a gate in front of this content.” Or they may want to go live, they may want to go asynchronously, and so they’ll come to us and say, “Look, we want to be able to have a common library so that people can see past live events.” Plus, they want to be able to serve new content. In some cases, we’re getting organizations that want to do more interactive content — so like clickable videos, as an example. It’s a whole variety of creators that are saying, “Look, we might not want to adhere to the… let’s call it compliance requirements, the economic requirements, or the IP requirements of the big platforms. Give us an environment that we can control ourselves.” And that environment lives on their websites? Exactly. Sidemen is a great example of a group. They have one of the biggest followerships in the UK. They sold out Wembley Stadium in two hours and they famously played a soccer match where, when a yellow card was shown, one of the Sidemen held up an Uno reverse e-card to the ref and it blew up the internet over in the UK. They serve on Vimeo. They have both content that they put on YouTube or they put on Instagram, but then some of the more extended content they actually put on Vimeo, and then that library lives on us as well for a lot of things. Dropout’s is another great example of that. Try Guys is a great example of that. Zeus Networks, Martha Stewart — where they want a little bit more control over the content and they want control over the monetization more so than what the traditional platforms give you. I’m going to ask you a question, and you’re just going to have to bear with me on the mathematical nature of this question. Hopefully, it makes sense. I have a lot of CEOs of web hosting companies on the show because I’m very curious about the web in the age of platforms and where the audience comes from. The last great referrer of web traffic is, as everyone knows, Google Search; Google Search is undergoing some sort of gigantic AI-powered identity crisis. Who knows what’s going over there, but it’s changing. So I have the CEO of Squarespace or the CEO of Wix, or whatever other hosting providers, and I say, “Why does anyone build a website? Why would you do that instead of starting a TikTok channel now?” And they all say, “Well, it’s to do e-commerce, right?” Embedded in that is some sense that, “Okay, you’ve built a following on some platform, now you want to sell something to your audience. And you have to sell the spoons somewhere, so you’re going to start Spoons.com and that’s going to be hosted on Squarespace, and that’s the way it goes.” You’re describing the content itself as being valuable, and being more valuable when it’s hosted on Vimeo. Maybe you’re selling it, maybe you’re doing subscriptions, whatever you’re doing. But that’s happening on a website because you can’t transact that way on YouTube or TikTok. You can’t make the content valuable, but you’re still stuck with how you get the audience to come to the website that’s still just some fraction of a search audience or some fraction of conversions from one of the social video platforms. And that — this is the math — seems like the upper bound of your growth. Because some number of people have to come to the website, some number of people have to choose to transact on a video from the Try Guys, and that can only grow insofar as all of those individual customers can get people to come to the websites. Do you see that the web is the limiter in that way? No, not at all. I’ve worked for Google, Amazon, and Microsoft in my life. Most recently at Google, I worked in all manners of businesses and data problems, and I have this foundational philosophy that there’s actually more data behind firewalls and paywalls than there is in front. There’s more information behind those firewalls and paywalls than in front. And when I take a look at the enterprise market for video… In the past, you’d have a marketing video and it was hard, or you might have a couple of product videos for e-commerce. Or you might have, for example, the CEO’s message. Video is coming to literally every single element of business. In the same way that it’s 82 percent of the internet, it’s coming in [to business]. And so whether or not it’s that e-newsletter, whether or not it’s for sales… You look at an organization like Seismic or Gong, that records sales calls, and then it helps to coach individuals. If you watch a video, you’re 67 percent more likely to buy a product. And so we’ve got very large e-commerce customers where they now have millions of videos on us that are serving to every single product page on their website. So what I’m seeing is quite frankly that there is an explosion of video. It’s such an engaging medium. When you watch a video, you have 91 percent better retention than when you read something. A lot of the stuff that’s behind the firewall and behind the paywall is now getting video enabled, and it’s going across every single division inside of an organization, and it actually dwarfs what I’ll call a lot of the content. We’re going to see video show up in so many different ways and in so many different businesses. People are starting to use video to be able to determine efficiencies inside quick-service restaurants. They’re starting to use video to be able to evaluate what’s on a shelf and whether or not there’s a stock on the shelf. So when I think about this, I don’t think about it just in terms of one segment of our organization. Actually, the beauty of Vimeo is that we’re able to live inside and outside the firewall, and YouTube does not live inside the firewall. We’re able to hook in and sign a [business associate agreement] to do HIPAA for a doctor. YouTube’s not going to do that. You think about all the interactions in the healthcare industry that actually can be video-enabled… And so our upper bound of growth is a larger opportunity than what YouTube is focused on right now. YouTube, right now, is focused on video podcasts. They picked their shot and they’re going to take it. By the way, every time anyone says that stat about video retention, I feel like a dinosaur because I need to read. For as much video podcasting as I literally do, I am a reader. I’m an underliner. I have to underline things. I learned to highlight with five colors in law school. It’s still where I’m at. Maybe the future is video and that’s why we do a video podcast, but I’m still a reader to my core. There are three parts of the video business. We’ve talked a lot about distribution, and where you might distribute that video. It sounds like that’s where you think there’s a lot of growth across organizations, even to consumer in some new way. Then there’s monetization, which I want to go to, but the first part is the hardest and I think undergoing the most change in terms of what we expect videos to be, and that’s obviously creation. You need to make a video, you need to distribute it, you need to monetize it. The creation of video right now is super interesting because you have not just the young generation, but everybody learning to speak the language of TikTok. TikTok, I think, is most importantly expressed to people as a video editor, not just a scrolling video tool, and it’s a very powerful video editor that you can also use in CapCut. Then there’s AI, which is making it a lot easier to make all kinds of videos in all kinds of ways, and then there’s the smaller AI components, like it’s going to write a script for you that you can read and maybe that’s good. Maybe that’s bad, but it’s all just in the mix. Everyone is expecting the tools to guide them. You can see in particular how TikTok tools, challenges, filters, and templates create a kind of culture that builds upon itself. Are you thinking of that component of it? Like “We need to build an enterprise TikTok editor for people just to bring them into the pipeline?” I think there are a couple of dynamics that are happening right now. This is what gets me so excited about this… One of the biggest things that brought me here is that the barriers to video creation are dropping so dramatically, which leads to that mass proliferation of video, and then the difficulty in being able to manage at that scale. That’s just, foundationally, the market forces that are behind us. I always pause for a second and tell people, “I’ll be able to talk to you for a long time about artificial intelligence in a couple of seconds, but let me talk to you about what’s happening in video formats.” You’re one hundred percent right. Right now, we’re in that era when mobile video is becoming much easier. People are becoming more comfortable. Covid really helped us get comfortable with dogs barking in the background, babies being inserted into frames, and basically, I’ll just call it more casualness, in video. Before it was highly scripted, if you recall. Highly scripted. And so culturally, people are getting much more comfortable shooting video. The proliferation of tools has been extraordinary. Now, we did make some acquisitions in the past. Magisto was an example of this because we really felt that we had to make it easier and easier to be able to create video. Well, I was thrilled with the proliferation of tools. We shot a video for our Reframe conference. I shouldn’t say shot a video — we actually created a video using 16 AI tools that didn’t exist 18 months ago. Over $15 billion of venture capital has gone into creating those tools and that’s just one small set. But you’re absolutely right… You’ve got all these tools that are being created and so we are thrilled about that, but simultaneously, the format of video is also proliferating, and so you’ve got traditional like 1068, and you’ve got 4K that’s starting to become more commonplace. 8K is arriving. When you do 8K, it’s roughly about six times the size of a 4K video. Well, 16K and 32K televisions are on the horizon right now. You’ve got wide stream formats, square formats for podcasting, rectangular formats, and then we just recently released Apple Vision Pro support to be able to stream on an Apple Vision Pro — which is 8K per eye, 36 frames per second. Simultaneously, while the tools are proliferating, the format types are also proliferating. So, your ability to both accept video from any format… In some cases, you accept something that’s an old, old format that you have to get improved, or it’s a super high quality, giant widescreen format that needs to be cut up for all the different areas that you’re going to serve that video. What I would tell you is that it’s becoming more complex for the creator to choose which tool to use and when, and then how to ensure that the right format gets served at the right moment. So the two simultaneous things that are happening in our business are creative tools and formats, and they are exponentially growing right now. They’re exponentially growing the amount of video that a creator has to deal with. What’s growing the fastest? It’s really interesting. As you can imagine, I think the square format is popping up a lot. We are seeing a lot of demand for 4K — 4K in live formats and in serving formats. I think people are starting to demand that format more, which is obviously for us… We have to move more bits, we have to store more bits, we’ve got to transcode more bits, and so I would tell you that’s probably the thing that we’re seeing spike the most in terms of consumption. The traditional mobile stuff is going to be there and it’s going to be constant. I think it’s almost growing at the speed of so-called mobile phones, but I’m actually surprised about how many people are coming to us asking us for 4K. Why do you think that is? I look at the broader industry and you see the big streamers are pushing everybody to 1080p with ads. That’s sort of the default for Max or Netflix, and then you have to pay extra for 4K. Are you seeing that demand in the same way they do, which is that people will pay extra for it? Or are you seeing that demand as this is now the understood industry norm? It may be the place that we sit in the industry. As I mentioned at the top of our talk, people have always come to us for quality. So it may just be that because we’ve been known for quality — we’ve been known for the quality of our transcoding, our stream, the service that we do — that people are not finding that kind of support elsewhere and coming to us for it. I think that people are experimenting with those formats. I’ve been pleasantly surprised with the sheer number of people who have come to us since we launched the Apple Vision Pro. They are coming to us with really interesting film projects to do 8K per eye, stitching all the camera work together. You’ll see us talk a lot about this at SXSW, about what we think. I’m seeing some good excitement in those 8K formats as well, that’s all I’ll say, but it might just be the position that we sit in the industry. It’s so interesting to see the rest of the industry basically insist that consumers don’t care about 4K. You and I are talking two days before the Super Bowl. For all of Fox’s talk about 4K, they’re still producing that in 1080p and then upscaling it. It’s fascinating to see the consumer side of the market land at one standard quality level while you’re saying the enterprise side of the market — the more discerning part of the market — is now not only assuming that 4K will exist, but that you will support 8K per eye, 36 frames per second on the Vision Pro. And when there’s 16K for TVs out, I think people will be buying them. That’s a lot of cost, right? I mean you’re talking about moving an enormous amount of data. Are you just getting ahead of it because that’s what the customers expect? You have a background in cloud services and big data. Is that something where you say, “Okay, this is just scalable? We can solve this problem with the tools we have”? Or do you have to build new systems? It’s a little bit like… I’ll use the corollary of what’s going on with token size inside of AI models, where everybody knows that the very first version of ChatGPT was maybe, I don’t know, a hundred million tokens and then it popped over to a billion tokens and will be up to a trillion tokens. So the cost to be able to deliver all of that will come down over time. The cost of storage comes down, the cost of bandwidth comes down, and then even the innovations that are in the televisions, those costs will be coming down. When you think about the quality of the TVs we have now versus even just 10 years ago, it’s so discernibly different and I think that as those costs come down, somebody has to serve that content and our infrastructure... We have the infrastructure to be able to do it, and so for some of us, we have to stay slightly ahead so that we are that place that’s always viewed as quality. So yeah, I guess it has to be part of our DNA that we’re always going to support those cutting-edge formats. We’ve opened the door to AI and I definitely want to talk about that and in particular, using AI as a creative tool, and how your customers might be thinking about that and their relationship to it. But first, I just want to get to the Decoder questions. We’ve talked a lot about how you’re thinking about growing Vimeo’s business. What would you say is the most tangibly different thing you’re doing compared to your predecessor Anjali? There are a couple of things. I think Anjali was supporting a lot of different businesses. I’ll say as you went through covid and as you went through when video was hard… I would say it wasn’t as culturally ingrained as it is right now. She had to make a lot of decisions around the business. When I got here, a lot of people asked me this question: “Well, do we serve the consumer or do we serve the enterprise? Do we serve the filmmaker or do we serve the physician?” When I really spent time with who our customer was, I really had to get deep, deep, deep down inside and go, who really uses us? Show me the type of company, show me the names of the companies, and the industries that we’re in. It was very clear to me that we serve the creator who is professional, somebody who is using video for their business professionally. It’s not a hobby. It’s actually to get a job done. Being able to consensus around that creative pro, not trying to go and create a YouTube competitor or a low-cost tool for the hobbyist, but truly that we serve that professional creator, and then being able to describe very succinctly the fact that all of that comes together. Sometimes a professional creator wants to serve a single video. Sometimes they need to be able to manage thousands of videos. Sometimes they want to be able to go live, sometimes they need a high quality, and sometimes they need help to divide it, to cut it up into rectangular or square formats. I think one of the core things that I did when I got here was really obsess about the customer. Every meeting we start, we start by telling a customer’s story. I learned a lot of this, I would tell you, between Google and Amazon. Amazon is, I would say, renowned for this, but we really tell the stories of who our creators are and then really build the ability to move quickly and listen to those enterprise requirements. When you start a company, and… I started at Microsoft in the very early days of Microsoft. It wasn’t an enterprise company then, believe it or not. Amazon, when I got there, didn’t have a lot of financial services companies using the cloud. I went through that transition. At Google, it wasn’t really known as an enterprise-grade cloud when I first got there. So I’ve been through this transition, and when you start a product that is going to serve the enterprise, what I always tell people is that it’s easier to get more complex, but it’s really hard to be complex and get easier. And so we were starting from these roots as a consumer and filmmaker’s product, and a lot of what I’ve focused on is really listening quickly to not just our individual customers, but the entire spectrum, and being able to say yes to those requirements. I also come with a tremendous amount of experience as you can imagine. You could look at my background — it’s years of enterprise experience, and so, I know what’s required to be able to do HIPAA. I understand how to do General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). I understand compliance requirements. When we go into things like artificial intelligence, or we go into storage and distribution, I have a lot of instincts around that. Spending the time to explain where we’re going as a company, to be able to serve both inside and outside the firewall, and the requirements that we’re going to have architecturally, and just explaining that to the organization and weaving together… Hey, that filmmaker wants their content protected the same way that the largest retailer in the world or the CEO wants their content protected, then weaving those two messages together and building a product roadmap that’s going to serve both. I feel like that’s probably the biggest thing that I’ve done since getting here: unifying the vision into a single cohesive vision. And then the second thing is really making sure that all of us are telling the stories. “Hey, did you know that this fertility clinic is using us in this way? Did you know that this school teacher is using us in this way? Did you know that this faith organization uses us in this way? Do you know that the largest retailer uses us this way?” Getting people to tell the stories internally, I think, was important. The last thing I’ll tell you is that there was a little bit of a shine that came off the company after the IPO. I think, giving the company confidence and saying, “Let me tell you who’s actually using us.” I don’t think that a lot of people really realized, internally even, the broad array of customers we have. I put this in our shareholder letter: we have eight out of the top eight big box retailers. We have eight out of the top eight media companies that are using us internally. We have huge numbers of insurance and financial services companies, companies that could use anybody, and I said they’re using us for a reason. So getting some confidence back into the company that we actually are an incredibly valuable tool in a world of increasing complexity — I think that gives the company a lot more confidence to be even bolder as we go forward. You’re talking a lot about culture change, and renewed focus. The thesis of this show is that that comes out of structure. I’m just looking at our notes here from my producers. In the past few months, you’ve named a new chief marketing officer, a new chief information security officer, a new people officer, and a new chief revenue officer. You’re obviously making some changes in the organization. How was Vimeo structured and how are you restructuring? I think that, in some cases, our technology organizations were incredibly siloed. How we did trust and safety as an example, in some cases how we did data, and who owned which parts of engineering. They were actually broken up in a lot of ways. I think oftentimes our marketing organization had one mandate while the sales organization might’ve had another mandate. A lot of what I would tell you was really important to me… One of my first hires was a chief technology and product officer, Bob Petrocelli. I brought in an individual who unifies product engineering and is able to have single-threaded leadership over top of parts of the business that are that important. They have to be working together well. Some of the things that we’re doing in trust and safety, we actually think we can turn around and expose that to our enterprise customers. It turns out they probably don’t want things on their platform the same way that we don’t want certain things on our platform. So getting any internal function to become an external function and getting that kind of view that we all serve the customer in some way, shape, or form is super important inside of our product and technology organizations. One of the most important things I had to do was bring in our Chief Marketing Officer, Charlie Ungashick, who has really extensive experience marketing to individuals and enterprise. We are going out and talking about how we can protect videos, serve videos, and provide AI to that entire audience. So we had to get an individual who was able to oversee both parts of the business. I’ve also done some recent restructuring where we put an individual completely in charge of what we call our self-service business. To be able to move even faster in that part of the business and obsess on everything from the top of the funnel all the way through when a subscriber comes in, right down to “what are we actually using in the product”… And this is a big element as well. I will tell you one of the other changes I didn’t mention is that we’re obsessing on use right down to the feature level. I look at those reports on a weekly basis, like how many people are using our edit feature, and how many people are using our live feature. How many people applied permissions to a video? Did that increase week over week? What did we do? And so that self-service leader is really now a single-threaded leader, and we also had a single-threaded leader around our streaming business. We really started seeing some of the results from that inside the company. Giving single-threaded leadership, I will tell you it is talked about a lot, but oh my God, it’s beautiful to actually be able to call up somebody that owns the number, that owns the resources, that worries about it as much as you do every single day. Single-threaded leadership is an Amazon concept. You’ve worked at all the companies, so I can pick out where the concepts come from. It’s pretty fun for me. That’s a classic Amazon concept. It is. You need to have a pretty small team that owns the thing and there’s a leader who is responsible for the whole stack. That is how you get silos. You can look at Amazon’s product and say, “Oh, there’s a bunch of single-threaded leaders here.” This is not necessarily cohesive. Everything is running as fast as it can, but the holistic vision of the Amazon product suffers for it at scale, right? You started out talking about having too many silos and we’re talking about single-threaded leaders. How are you managing that tension? I was asked one time to give a talk on what it was like to work at Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. I got an opportunity to work directly with Gates, Ballmer, Jassy, and then certainly with Thomas Curry and Sundar Pichai. One of the most important lessons I learned very early on at Microsoft was about really establishing a strong single-sentence vision for the entire company about what we’re trying to do in the future. And you wake up every single morning and I mean… I was there in the early days when the vision was a PC on every desktop in every home. That was extraordinary at the time. Now we have a PC in every pocket, but we all knew that what we were trying to do was unlock information for the world by putting this powerful computing device in someone’s hands. And so regardless of the divisions or otherwise, it all feathered into a common vision. It was a lot of what I had to do when I got here. I owed the company a strong agreement among everybody in the company about what we’re trying to build. Are we trying to build the best livestream product? Are we trying to build the best marketing platform? Are we trying to build a product for filmmakers? We settled on this common vision and then we’re able to say, “Okay, this is the individual that owns this part of the business.” There’s a huge portion of our individual business where people swipe a credit card and start using us or register for free. A huge number of those customers actually end up as enterprise customers. I called up one of the top retailers and started talking to him about Vimeo and he said, “Well, first of all,” he goes, “You don’t have to tell me who you are.” He goes, “My son is on Vimeo every weekend. He’s an independent filmmaker.” He goes, “So I know who you are, but why are you calling me?” And I said, “Well, we have 2,600 accounts, self-service accounts that are on [our platform]. We should do an enterprise agreement.” So being able to explain to the organization how the two sides work together and being able to make decisions in a room between where we’re applying more features may be in one part of the business or another… And how those features actually feather, how we might start them for an individual, but they have to grow to work for an entire enterprise — is all really, really important. Starting with a strong vision that everybody buys into, that they understand their piece of it, is really critical. And then for each one of those leaders, I expect them to have a strong vision for how they’re going to contribute to the overall vision. That’s another important thing. You can’t let their vision exist in the absence of the rest of the company’s vision, so you have to actively stitch those visions together. You brought up decisions. That’s the other classic Decoder question. I will warn you: this is a honeypot for former Amazon executives. When you ask Amazon executives how they make decisions, everybody sings chapter and verse, but you’ve worked at a bunch of places. You are now the CEO of this company. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework? The other company I didn’t talk about that I learned a lot from was Google. One of the things that I would tell you Google gave me was that they managed something like 10 out of the top 11 billion-user products in the world and were really thinking big. Actually giving an organization incredibly lofty goals, and sometimes you only reach 80–90 percent of them. One of the things that I do first and foremost is — that I really am a believer in — that you’ve got to set these very high goals. You need to have this vision and you need to be willing to put yourself out there to set extremely high goals. And then back into that from a decision-making process, I would tell you that we’ve made a number of decisions around which products we focus on, which areas we deprecate. I come back to the customer. One of the things I really try to hold people accountable to, and I think it’s really important, I learned a lot of this both at Google and at Amazon, but actually explaining the customer problem that we’re trying to solve. And there are all kinds of studies that you can do. There are user studies, data studies, and so forth, but truly being able to assess what that workflow looks like. What are we trying to solve? What is the most challenging thing for the customer? What is actually frustrating the customer most? And really having a strong sense for your customer and the customer anecdotes as well as what we call... At Google, we called it customer empathy, actually putting yourself in the shoes of the customer. One of the things that we ask everyone inside of Vimeo to do is be a user of the product. So the things that are frustrating us, we are elevating those into our decision-making process. We both bring the voice of the customer in and, we bring our own voice in, and then we also are saying, “Okay, well what’s going to help us grow? What’s going to grow the next million users for us or what’s going to grow us to 10X?” So I can’t just tell you it’s one thing. It’s a little bit of a framework of the customer, making sure we’re tethered to big ideas and really making sure that we’re being innovative enough in how we push the team. Well, I applaud you for being the only former Amazon executive to not talk about one-way and two-way doors when I ask that. You’ve done it, you’ve achieved escape velocity. I mean, I appreciate the one-way and two-way doors. I’m just saying. No, I get it. I don’t know if I’d buy that. The thing I do love, I mean, at Google, I think they’ve proven that there’s not a lot of one-way doors. Fair enough. Google’s interesting. We’ve talked a lot about YouTube during this conversation. Vimeo has come out against YouTube. You have entire blog posts about how your search capabilities are better than YouTube’s search capabilities or how Vimeo is a better platform. You’ve talked, even in this episode, about wanting things to be private, not being part of the algorithmic ecosystem or the advertising ecosystem on YouTube. Google is big. They think so big that sometimes they let opportunities just slide away because they think at such a massive scale. How are you thinking about competing with YouTube at that scale when they seem to own so much of the attention, space, and video? I don’t think that a lot of product companies love the fact that you have to go to YouTube to get some customer support for one of their products. Meanwhile, one of their competitors could be rolling right next to you. And I think that when I look at YouTube… I was at Google and spent a lot of time with customers, and I really foundationally believe... I love YouTube, I’ll watch YouTube as much as the next person. I think that what they’re doing for, I’ll call it the attention economy, for what they’re doing around content, for democratizing access to more and more content — I think it’s absolutely wonderful. And quite frankly, as I said, a lot of our customers are great YouTube customers as well. People will house their videos on Vimeo and post on YouTube in a lot of ways. But I really do think that there is… In the same way that you don’t do a lot of your business on Facebook or you don’t do it on LinkedIn, you kind of do it behind closed walls. I think that a lot of the economy runs behind firewalls and paywalls. So I think that we can go directly at that. The other thing I’m going to say is… Think about what happened in content and why some of these platforms rose. Think about, and again, I’m old enough to remember MSN and AOL — the reason why we went there was because news had to be consolidated. It was hard to create websites. It was difficult to find information, it had to be curated. Well, Netflix and YouTube were born in an era where it was really hard to categorize content to say, “Hey, this video is about a cat,” or “This video is about how to plug an HDMI cord into the back of your LG TV.” And so there was categorization that had to take place. There was standardization of the data, the metadata, and then recommendations engines. I don’t know if you remember, but Netflix famously paid a million dollars to be able to write their recommendation engine. They went out and said, “Whoever builds the best recommendation engine will win a million dollars.” Well, with an AI model, I can categorize content in seconds now. With a recommendation engine, I can buy recommendation engines off the shelf. And quite frankly, the metadata that we can produce now out of a video is extraordinarily more detailed than a human being can even write. I can tell you precisely when the purse left the beach, who was carrying the purse, and what brand of shoes the individual was wearing. All stuff that may be missed when a human being has to enter all that metadata. And so what I see is that there is going to be a democratization of content classification, content recommendation, and context discoverability. I think that there are searches… There is a single search place that you go to be able to get your content, videos, and maps, and pick your favorite things. But I think that there are billions of dollars going into discovering other ways to find and interact with information. And so I think that Vimeo can serve that kind of information outside of a traditional Google search in a lot of ways, whether or not you’re on an intranet inside of a company, whether or not you’re inside an AI model and you don’t want to leave the ecosystem of the AI model. We can provide an answer to a question as well. I think YouTube is fantastic, I love it, but I think that for the discoverability, accessibility, indexing, and recommendations, there’s a whole new era coming and we intend to be a part of it. There’s another piece of that dynamic that I’m wondering if you are considering, which is that Google is a huge company that is under an enormous amount of pressure right now. Maybe it’s so much pressure that it will be hard for the company to execute. There’s an antitrust trial in this country that resulted in the government suggesting Google break itself up and sell Chrome. There’s Donald Trump in the mix, who may or may not make some sort of deal. There’s a Donald Trump in the mix who’s done a tariffs regime with China that resulted in a Chinese antitrust investigation of Google — which is amazing because Google doesn’t really operate in that country. Europe exists, much to the chagrin of many of our tech companies. There’s just a lot going on. There’s a lot of pressure on Google to not flex that dominance. And then there’s competitive pressure from the AI products, like ChatGPT, SearchGPT, and Bing — to whatever extent that Microsoft believes that Bing is a real competitor to Google. Does that create an opening for you? Do you see that as a real opening or is that just well, if those doors open, you’ll be ready? I have a lot of friends at Google. I really enjoyed my time there. I don’t wish them ill in any way, and I really hope that they sail through this era of challenge for them in a really great way. Clearly, I came here from Google because I saw the opportunity. I really did see the opportunity that… We’re about to go through a seismic shift in the accessibility of information with new ways to go and access it. Whether or not you’re using ChatGPT, Anthropic, or Mistral, there are so many different ways to be able to discover information. The notion of the common crawl on the web, the ability to be able to crawl the whole web, index it, and then to be able to ingest it into these models shows that it’s democratizing access to that information discovery. Video is a very important element of video, and I think you’d agree. You can’t just imagine only one platform is going to serve all the video answers in the world, and so that’s where I see it’s such a super opportunity for us at Vimeo. Let’s talk about AI. I want to start by asking a mathematical question. One of my theses for the year is that the creator economy is under an enormous amount of pressure. Not just from AI, but also from what you’re describing: this huge shift to video. You can see that there’s just an exponential increase in the supply of video on all these platforms. More and more kids are making videos. More and more people are choosing to communicate in video-first ways. More enterprises are doing it. And then you have AI, which is just making it easier and easier to produce a massive amount of video. So the platforms are getting flooded with supply. There’s not as much ad revenue as there is an increase in video supply, so you do the division and you’re like, well, the ad rates are going to go down, and then attention is sort of fixed. There are only so many people with so many hours in a day, and presumably, people do have to eat and do productive work. So attention is kind of fixed, right? It’s just like a fixed number that you can capture. That all just seems like it’s a bubble that’s going to pop. You flood an ecosystem that has been pretty stable for a few years with an enormous amount of supply, the ad rates go down, and attention stays fixed. Something happens in there, and it seems like, to me, AI is the most important component of that because it’s the thing that can change the economics of the supply the fastest. You just say, “Make 50 videos about my product,” and now we have 50 videos about the product on whatever platform. Is that an opportunity for you? That this whole creator economy, or the video creator economy as we know it, seems like it’s going to have a pretty basic shift in its economics? That’s a huge question. To me, it is the question of 2025 — if you asked me, “What is The Verge doing in 2025?” There’s Elon Musk and DOGE, and then there’s what happens to the creator economy. I think with the creator economy, we are reaching saturation. I mean, think of your own experience. I don’t know when we’re going to get to the post-mobile phone era, but this is not a way we’re going to live for the rest of eternity as human beings. And so on the creator’s side, yes, I think that there is a saturation point, but I also think that people are looking for a little bit of a higher quality experience. I think people are getting tired of the doom scrolling. I think the mere fact that we name it, the fact that we are now acknowledging that we get sent down rabbit holes... I do think people will like storytelling. And I do think there’s going to be really different opportunities. I get asked all the time, “When will AI be able to take my favorite book and turn it into a movie?” And now, think about that. Think about how wonderful that would be. Think about being able to take your child’s favorite book and turn it into a video for them that has an extended storyline. I think storytelling is as old as humanity and it’s going to continue forward and so I do — Can I just stop you there for one second? I know the Decoder audience fairly well. A lot of people just started screaming at you in their car because they think that’s a bad outcome. Do you think that’s a bad outcome? I have a young child. The idea that we’re going to read The Wild Robot and then some AI tool is going to make the movie The Wild Robot instead of the beautiful actual movie made by people, The Wild Robot — I would argue that that’s a bad outcome. I think it is for a class. Here’s what bugs me the most right now. Last year the big six studios only put out 88 movies. 88. Right, because the economics of video have collapsed on them. They don’t have a distribution monopoly. Exactly, and I think there are so many stories to be told. If the creator of The Wild Robot gets paid for having a movie and is able to be monetized in some shape or form, in a really beautiful way, I actually think we’re supporting storytellers in a foundational way. I think that that’s a decade away. I would say maybe five to seven years away. And so first and foremost, I do think that AI is going to help people create more stories. I think they are. I think they’re going to be able to illustrate more stories, let’s put it that way. I talk to a lot of creative types who tell me, “Look, AI is fairly disjointed right now. It’s indeterministic. I don’t know what I’m going to get out of it.” Human curation of AI creation is going to be a necessity, in the same way that shooting on a green screen and then being able to put in a background for a movie is indeterministic until the human being decides what’s on that green screen. What I’m saying is that I do think that longer-form stories are going to be more compelling. I think people are going to want to stay inside of a story a little bit longer. That doesn’t mean that the creator is going away. It doesn’t mean human curation is going away. I just think that we’re going to be able to tell more beautiful stories in more ways. So I’ll park there because we are pro-creator, we are pro-filmmaker, and we serve a lot of them. They’re not going away. We’re going to uplift them and make them faster. I think this is a real tension, and I see it expressed all the time. I’ve heard it from your peers on the show when they tell me about the tools that people use in Photoshop, right? Generative fill in Photoshop, according to Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen, is like a hundred percent usage rate. But then, everyone yells about generative fill existing, and there’s a real mismatch between consumer expectations and how people feel about AI, and then about the creatives actually using the tools at high rates. I get all that. I also think there’s a mismatch between you saying you’re for filmmakers and how marketers want to use AI. I think we’re careening towards a world of basically custom creative being shown to individual users. [A world] where some brand uploads their assets to a video platform and ads get assembled for you in AI. For you, a specific user, [to get] ads targeted to your interests. We’re headed there and the big platform’s already talking about it. But those really commercial uses of AI — “we’re going to make a whole bunch of ads and we’re going to do some of the most creative filmmaking that exists” — they don’t seem like they’re happening at the same rate or with the same level of acceptance, or even like they should happen with the same tools, and you have every piece of the puzzle in front of you. Where do you see the biggest growth and where do you see the biggest pushback? One of our creators, Jake Oleson, recently shot Currents for Apple Vision Pro. And when you shoot for an Apple Vision Pro, you have to maintain perfect stillness in the camera. You’ll shoot four to six cameras and by hand, you have to stitch all these things together. If you get an opportunity to watch Currents, it’s absolutely stunning. You kind of look at it and go, “Oh my God, I’ve seen the future of filmmaking. I truly have.” And I do think that this is where I say that I think we’re going to get into a post-mobile phone era for watching content and creativity. And I think that we’ll experience film in new ways. We’ll experience stories in new ways. And I think that I’m seeing the best creators blend together the content and AI usage with traditional techniques to make something incredible. Most filmmakers that I talk to start with something they’ve shot and then enhance it with AI. One of the things that is most interesting to me is that, in the marketing world, the thing that’s taking off the most right now are not avatars (and avatars, I like to call them… like nobody wants to talk to a robot), it’s actually people that are sitting there going, “Hey, I just bought this piece of furniture. This looks really cool. Let me show you what it looks like inside of my house.” Actually, authenticity in a world of robots I think is actually... I’m already seeing it. We offered to a number of our customers, “Hey, would you like us to do some avatars?” And then we also offered to them, “Hey, we have this super down-and-dirty create tool where you can record, we can put a teleprompter up in front of you so you can do your own script. And we can either make the avatar look perfect or you can be sitting in your living room and do this quick thing about your product or about your service.” And inevitably, all of them go to the real human being doing this. I’m just going to tell you point blank: I’m not seeing the robots take off. I’m not seeing it. And we’ve tried to serve both. I think that humans have always risen above. They’ve always brought authenticity. They’ve always brought through how you kind of know when you’re getting something and when you’re not. Even in the chatbot world, how many people get frustrated when they’re talking to a chatbot online? They quickly want to talk to a human being. I don’t know how to say it to you, but we sense that there are no ghosts in the machine. So I don’t know how to say it to you any other way. I studied artificial intelligence for a long time and I’m very confident in the beauty of the human soul in the context of creativity. I feel like I’m more cynical than you, but I spend more time on social platforms, it feels like. And the problem, generally, is you can sense it. Some people can feel it, and a lot of people cannot, right? Or they just let it wash over them and then you end up in sort of interminable fights about metadata or labeling. Google just rolled out SynthID for images that you edit in Google Photos. None of that stuff seems to have landed. It has certainly not landed in a universal way. Vimeo has some labeling features. You have some ideas about how you might show people AI-generated content or expose that metadata to people. Do you think that’s working? Is that something you’re going to continue? Is that something that you think needs to be expanded? When I was at Google, there were about 42 different regulatory bodies that were working on AI legislation. The last we checked, there are over one thousand on a worldwide basis. And I’m raising that to say that when you do translations in certain states inside of the United States, like Illinois or Texas, you can’t actually modify people’s lips and put words in their mouths, so that’s just one of the regulations. Over in Europe, you actually do have to identify that something’s been AI-enhanced or modified. So I do think that we as humanity are wrestling with it when we want to know that something’s not real. The mere fact that that’s coming from all over the world, that you’re seeing the desire to know when something’s not real, I can’t say whether or not that’s good or bad, but I can tell you that it’s actually a human desire. And so, getting something done like changing the credit card on my telephone bill, I’ll deal with a bot to do that. But if I’m really having a problem, or my elderly father-in-law is having a problem, I actually do want a human being to pick up the phone and just talk him through it. I guess what I’d say to you is… I think in filmmaking as well, we’ve always used tools to tell our story. It’s been the invention of so many tools to help us tell stories. AI is just another tool to help us tell the stories. I would certainly like to know when characters aren’t real. I guess this is the hardest question. This is an existentially philosophical question, but: Where do you draw the line? Where do you personally think the line should be for when you have to put the label on something? I’ll give you two examples. I think when I stabilize a video with AI, that does not require it. I think if I’m talking to a deepfake avatar, or a creator that is photorealistic, that is just lying to me, that situation probably requires it, right? I’ve replaced products in this movie with other products and that may require it. Where do you think the line is? I think that I haven’t been asked this question before, but as I reflect on it, I would like to know that a particular character, animal, or something that’s in the film is actually not real — that it’s completely made up. Now you can tell that in animation, but in a real film, if I know that a certain character or a certain scene is actually completely fabricated with a single individual in it, I probably would like to know that. Or when there’s dialogue involved where something’s talking back to me that’s not for real, I probably want to know about it. When I look at some of the Marvel movies, clearly you start crossing the line. Well, does the fox in Guardians of the Galaxy do it? We all know the fox is- The latest Marvel movie they just announced is Fantastic Four, and they made the poster with AI, and there’s fan backlash to it. So I’m just wondering if you see the norms moving faster than the technology, or slower? You are shipping these products and you have such a direct line to creators, so it feels like you’re caught up right in the middle of where we put the labels. The thing that really does bother me right now is the influencers that don’t even exist. If I’m looking at something that’s clearly animated, I’m okay with it. I would love to know that somebody’s voice was actually used for real by that individual. So it’s going to be complex and I wonder out loud, will we stop caring, and at what point? Will we become comfortable that basically the whole thing is simply animated because that’s really what we’re talking about? We’re just creating animation that’s higher and higher fidelity in a lot of ways. But I think it should probably be noted that, at some point, the human doesn’t exist. I feel like that’s probably where I’d cross the line, or that dog doesn’t actually exist, especially if the dog’s a main character. So you might end up doing it based on the classification of the importance of the character and whether or not there’s actual, true existence there. And how much modification was done to the individual based on the class of character in the story? I asked that question three different ways and pushed on it again because it feels like the pressure on the creator economy and the social platforms is just going to go up. With Meta, Mark Zuckerberg is out there openly saying, “We will have AI content in people’s social feeds on Facebook and Instagram.” How they choose to label it, whether or not the mean dogs have labels — I don’t know. I don’t know what Mark Zuckerberg is going to do. No one can see into his soul, but it’s pretty obvious that if he could get a bunch more cute cat videos on Facebook using AI, he’s going to do it. It’s obvious why he would do that. Does that create an opportunity for you to say Vimeo is for real content or real people? Is that something you would lean into? Because you do have the AI tools. When you open the website today, it says you’re an AI-powered video platform. There’s a lot of conflation between “we can do better classification and with better recommendations” and “we can do better marketing videos and we’re going to steal everyone’s data and make cat videos for Facebook attention spans.” I think as I sit here and think about protecting the Vimeo brand, I aspire to actually be the place that people trust. When I first got here, we were approached to basically crawl our content and it was like as many companies were approached… We talked to the creators and the creators said, “Listen, don’t replace us. Just uplift us and protect us. Make sure that Vimeo is always a place where we’re protected and that’s why we come to you and that’s why we want to continue to come to you.” So we made a decision not to allow that crawling, and then shortly thereafter we had to say, “Anytime you use AI on Vimeo, we’re going to actually guarantee that none of the AI models will improve based on your usage of it.” Unless you say, “Improve based on my usage, like understanding my storyline, my filters, my dialogue, or my style of dialogue,” we’ll do that for you as an individual creator. We’ll create your own private AI. We were actually approached as well to say, “Listen, we need you.” A number of the creators said, “We want you to help us identify when content has been generated by AI.” We do a lot of business over in the EU, and so we said, “Yes, we’re going to do that as well.” The thing that I describe about AI… Back in the era of the production line, humans stopped being able to keep up in a lot of ways, and so we started creating robots. We started creating machines that turned on screws and so forth. And next year at this time, there’s going to be more information created in the next year than there has in the history of mankind coming up until this point. Humans are struggling to keep up with a production line of information. So we’ve invented these machines. I also think AI is going to help us identify these things. It will help us filter and help us be able to say, “This is AI generated,” or “This content cannot be verified from the source.” We have to do some work around what we call KYC or know your creator. In some jurisdictions that we operate in, we have to actually say, “Yes, this is a human being that created this, this is the company that created this.” I actually think we have an opportunity to serve as that — like “Yes, this was created by a real human,” which actually stands out in a world of robots. So I think there are a lot of opportunities to protect the viewer and the creator, as well as serve them in helping produce stories faster. I want to ask one more foundational question about AI. There’s a lot of talk about cost right now in the AI world. There’s DeepSeek, which might have brought down the cost of training. There’s an argument about whether the cost of inference will drop. At the same time, Sam Altman is saying he’s going to build $500 billion worth of data centers all around the world with SoftBank. You use these tools, right? You’re deploying these tools against some large data sets in video, which is where the costs tend to go up the fastest. Where do you think that is? Is that working out for you? Are you making more money on the use of AI than you’re spending on it right now? The short answer is yes. I would tell you that I expect the cost of inference to drop dramatically. We were experimenting with some of the exact same things that DeepSeek claimed to do, to be able to use really low-cost chips to be able to do inference. And I do expect inference… the cost of inference is going to go through the floor. I used to joke to say, “If I need to order a Frosty and a double burger at Wendy’s, I don’t need to wade through all of Taylor Swift’s boyfriends and songs to be able to get through that.” So distillations of models to be able to serve at the exact moment of time that’s necessary, whatever the language or the function is. I think that you’re going to see that distillation will help us with this. The most recent Blackwell chips from Nvidia were about four times more efficient. Lighter weight models are super important to us. So we’re going to solve a lot of the inference problems and the cost associated with inference. I’m seeing it drop dramatically for what we do, and so it’ll be very manageable over time. I think that the real big cost for a lot of these companies is the training of some of this stuff, and that is going to come in line as well. We’ll get to a point of diminishing returns, like do you really need to go to 10 trillion-parameter models, or do you need something that’s just lighter weight to be able to do chemistry, biology, security, or coloration, as an example? I think, right now, we’re in the era of big models, and I don’t think that’ll last. Do you think we need to spend $500 billion on data centers all around the world? We need to lay down a new infrastructure of silicon. The silicon that’s around the world right now is highly optimized for general compute, and this is a new mathematical model that has to be supported with silicon. Otherwise, we’d actually consume more power if we didn’t have specialized chips that run this math equation. So all that’s happening right now is that, yes, we need to run our current compute and now we have a new algorithm we have to run. We’re going to need optimized silicon to be able to run that extra algorithm. So the short answer is that we actually do have to duplicate the silicon around the world. Is that something that you can drive at Vimeo? We talked about needing to serve 8K and the price of storage and compute for those falling on a pretty predictable basis. We need to invent new silicon to support AI workloads. That’s like a whole industry effort, right? And the pressure is all on maybe a handful of companies in one foundry to pull that off. How do you make those bets? I would tell you that we’re doing a lot in evaluating quality across a whole spectrum. One of the things that, as I said to you at the very start, we’re obsessing about is how our creators really want to use AI. They don’t want to be replaced and all this. And so what we’re doing is we’re picking each one of these areas and actually establishing quality frameworks inside of Vimeo — I almost said Google — inside of Vimeo where we’re saying, “Hey, this is high-quality translation,” or, “This is what we need to do to be able to support understanding what changed frame to frame.” And so a lot of what we’re doing is that we’re saying, “Okay, what’s the best model for the job that our creators are going to need to get done?” And then under the surface, we’re stitching all that together so the creator doesn’t even know there might be multiple models that are supporting them. We’ve established quality and then also handoffs for that creator because, as I said to you, we’re creating AI that’s going to be unique to that creator. And so we’re going to remember whether it’s over here in the translation world, over in asking a question, indexing, or otherwise. We stitch it all together for the creator so they don’t even know that we might be using multiple AI, but it’s establishing quality bars for each one of those things. And then also economics — making sure we get the best economics and best performance, like queries per second from the model providers for that area so they can serve our massive minutes of video and number of creators. We’re managing performance, cost, and quality on behalf of the creator across multiple models. Well, Philip, as you can probably tell, I could talk to you forever, but we are out of time. What’s next for Vimeo? Give people a preview of what’s coming up next and we’ll let you get out of here. I’m probably most excited right now, as I mentioned to you, about the massive formats that are coming at the creator. I’m super excited about what can be done with immersive formats. I’m also starting to see a lot of people who want to go back into these sphere-like experiences. I do think that that’s going to be exciting and you’ll see us continue to push the edge there. You’re going to see us invest more in the filmmaking community. Literally on Monday, I’m headed over to the Berlin Film Festival after hopefully, my Philadelphia Eagles do well in the Super Bowl. So you’re going to see us do even more around staff picks and celebrating filmmakers in every geography we serve around the world. I mean, it’s been fairly US-centric, and you’re going to see us get a lot more global in supporting filmmakers. Also, I would tell you as we look over at our enterprise customers, we think we can support customers in their customer journey. This mass proliferation of video across every part of the organization in the service of customers. We’re going to do really well at just-in-time video serving just the right video to just the right person at just the right moment of the customer interaction. So you’ll see us really come out with some exciting things about that between the format and the AI, things we can do to transform storytelling. Amazing. Well, we’ll have to have you back when we do just-in-time immersive video, AKA to both eyes at the same time. Phil, thanks. That’d be amazing. Thank you. Questions or comments about this episode?

Title: An advanced degree was once viewed as the best path toward job security. It's now proving to be a liability.

What did you do last week? Sorry to be so blunt, but federal workers are grappling with that question. DOGE sent an email this weekend asking government employees to list their recent accomplishments before midnight tonight. Many told BI they feel frustrated by the request. The Department of Defense, meanwhile, instructed staff not to respond. In today's big story, getting an advanced degree was once viewed as the best path toward job security. Now, it's proving to be a liability on your résumé. What's on deck Markets: The takeaways from Warren Buffett's annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. Tech: A former big-time Elon Musk believer makes the case for why Tesla is in trouble this year. Business: The Russian media oligarch pushing Putin to even further extremes. But first, school's out forever. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Their degrees were something for them to fall back on. Instead, they're in a free fall. Job seekers with advanced degrees are having a much harder time finding work compared to their less-educated peers, writes Business Insider's Aki Ito. These days, you're better off with just a high school diploma instead of a Ph.D. if you want to find work fast. People who didn't go to college can get work twice as quickly as those with advanced degrees. (Let's be clear: Advanced-degree holders still largely rule the roost on compensation. But pay only matters once you have a job.) Aki has previously written about the struggles of white-collar workers thanks to hiring reductions among tech and finance firms. Those are common landing spots for people with advanced degrees, which might be why extra education isn't paying off in the job hunt. However, Aki's story explores whether the labor market's latest shift could signal a bigger change in the importance of education. All of this is also happening at a time when colleges are facing a reckoning. Some say you can't put a price on education, but universities have certainly tried. With the cost of a four-year degree at a private college easily surpassing $250,000, more and more young people are questioning the benefits of college, let alone grad school. Another corner of the job market that was once a sure thing is also getting shaken up. Government jobs, traditionally considered a stable paycheck with good benefits, have been upended by the Trump administration. (Just reread the intro to this newsletter if you need a recent example.) Tens of thousands of employees took buyouts, and thousands of probationary workers were fired during the first month of the Department of Government Efficiency's cost-cutting efforts.It's still unclear the impact these job cuts will have on the wider labor market. But continuing to make wholesale changes to the largest employer in the US, which is known for its job security, will likely have some residual effect. 1. Warren Buffett's tax bill was a doozy. Berkshire Hathaway, the legendary investor's conglomerate, paid a record $26.8 billion in taxes last year, Buffett wrote in his annual letter to shareholders. It's the most paid by any US company in history and represents about 5% of total American corporate income taxes paid in 2024. "Spend it wisely," Buffett wrote. The letter also included some more fundamental business — and life — lessons, too. 2. The meme coin explosion. Once an obscure corner of crypto, meme coins have taken on a life — and market — of their own. But scams are common with meme coins, and ongoing conversations about a regulatory path are another big question mark. 3. How a hedge fund repays $1.2 billion to investors heading for the exits. The past few years have been rocky for Paloma Partners, posting just a 2.5% return in 2024. The multistrategy hedge fund said last fall it would take time to repay departing investors. To meet redemption requests, Paloma plans to pull $600 million from hedge funds it backed, including the quant firm Aquatic Capital, according to four people familiar with the matter. 1. An early Tesla investor is now bearish on the stock. Ross Gerber was among the first to spot Tesla's potential, but he isn't feeling so confident now. Gerber doubts the company can achieve Full Self-Driving on time without switching hardware, and he believes Elon Musk has too many pots in the fire. 2. We're hiring … just not humans. Originally created as an experiment, two founders built a jobs board for AI agents. The jobs board, dubbed "Job for Agent," provides insight into what companies might look for in an AI workforce. 3. AI bosses feel the pressure. In a recent interview, the CEOs of Google DeepMind and Anthropic spoke about the weight of responsibility that comes with ushering in AI. The leaders urged people to better grasp the real force for change they expect AI to be — and for societies to start planning accordingly. 1. The oligarch who wants to "Make Russia Great Again." There is one Russian nationalist currently in the spotlight who may be even more zealous than Vladimir Putin. Konstantin Malofeyev operates Tsargrad, a multimedia platform with over three million followers. He embraces Trumpian rhetoric and helped organize the Russian separatist rebellion in Ukraine's Donbas region, paving the way for Putin's invasion. But Malofeyev thinks Putin isn't doing enough to crush Ukraine. 2. Scaredy-cat capitalism in the new Trump era. While deregulation and tax cuts are generally favored by corporate America, Trump and his policies aren't exactly predictable. That's leading some companies — from Meta to Disney — to brace for his whims. Many businesses are trying to get in Trump's good graces by cutting back on DEI and handing over a check. 3. You might be waiting on your tax return this year. The Internal Revenue Service began firing probationary workers last week who were not "critical" to tax filing season. These terminations are part of Trump's efforts to slash the federal workforce, but it could result in more backlogs, slower customer service, and delayed refunds, tax experts and IRS employees told BI. An IRS HR employee said the firings, coupled with a hiring freeze, could set the agency behind on its functions well into 2026.

Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images In the summer of 2024, I noted that the stock market was likely to move higher. However, the big tech leaders were seen as too extended and overvalued. This group was due for a correction. If the market was to move higher and the tech leaders were to correct, then other lagging stocks would have to start outperforming, which has been the case. Let us take a closer look. The relative strength of the equally-weighted NASDAQ versus the S&P 500 turned up in late December and remains strong. This indicates that the average stock in the NASDAQ 100 is stronger than the cap-weighted S&P 500. The big-cap tech stocks have been lagging while the smaller weights in the index have been rising. The result: Many more stocks are rising but the equities that have the greatest influence on the indices have lagged. This is in sharp contrast to the situation in 2024 in which only 25% of the stocks outperformed the S&P 500. Note the rising relative strength as denoted by the green line. The relative strength screen shows that within the NASDAQ 100, the big eight tech stocks are ranked from No. 6 (Netflix) to No. 75 (Microsoft). Here are the stocks in relative strength order with the cycles recommendations in parentheses: Netflix (hold) Meta Platforms (sell) Tesla (buy) Nvidia (sell) Amazon (sell) Apple (hold) Google (sell) Microsoft (cycle low in March) This monthly cycle graph explains the buy signal on Tesla. This accurate monthly cycle points to higher prices through 2025. Here is another graph that explains the sell opinion on Nvidia: This cycle peaked at the price high and points down though the year. The top five NASDAQ current relative performers are: 1. Palantir 2. Super Micro Systems 3. Axon 4. Atlassian 5. DoorDash Some of these stocks are extremely overbought and too risky to buy now. From these new leaders, here are two stocks that can be added to portfolios. Super Micro came down hard, and is now giving longer-term buy signals, supported by rising cycles. There are weekly buy signals and a very oversold monthly price. Atlassian features technical strength and a rising monthly cycle. Use the pullback in this cycle and any NASDAQ weakness to accumulate shares. The cycle rises from March to June.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “Nobody’s honest. Scientists are not honest. And people usually believe that they are. That makes it worse. By honest I don’t mean that you only tell what’s true. But you make clear the entire situation. You make clear all the information that is required for somebody else who is intelligent to make up their mind” — Richard Feynman “The Unscientific Age”, The Meaning of It All (1998) Number of the Week: 29,000 THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: TWTW will continue with questioning whether climate science is a physical science. TWTW begins with a discussion of omitting physical evidence by the UN IPCC. Then it discusses the importance of the Greenhouse Effect. TWTW discusses a report that Earth’s albedo is changing. Then it discusses a report by Ross McKitrick that some advocates of the so-called social cost of carbon omitted key evidence. A controversy at the Royal Society is discussed, followed by an essay by David Legates explaining why the vaunted Hydrogen Economy is not materializing. TWTW concludes with a discussion on the failure of the green energy transition. ********************* Is It Science? For years, organizations have used the term science to sanctify their political actions. Some of these organizations even have the term science in their names, others are government organizations funded with the intent for providing physical evidence for certain concerns, such as weather. Most researchers are no doubt scrupulous, but some, such as James Hansen, may deceive themselves. Others seek funding for advancement and to profit from it. But in physical science the ultimate and final judge, nature, is impartial. All ideas and theories must be tested against what nature reveals to us, physical evidence from observation and experiment. To SEPP this is what is meant by applying the scientific method. And those ideas and theories which fail to meet the test must be discarded. Unfortunately, a common practice among researchers who are less than scrupulous is omitting data (physical evidence) that contradicts the desired conclusion. As Stephen McIntyre has demonstrated repeatedly, this practice was common to the so-called hockey-stick. It was featured in the reports of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [particularly the Third Assessment Report (AR3 or TAR, 2001)]. [The cover of the TAR Synthesis Report: Summary for Policymakers has been altered in recent versions, however the hockey-stick style shape (of roughly stable temperatures between the year 1000 to 1900 then sharply increasing temperatures and projections thereafter to 2100) can be seen in Figure SPM-10b: Variations of the Earth’s surface temperature: years 1000 to 2100.] Click to access spm.pdf To call such reports “science” is misleading. It is not physical science and some of the findings are contradicted by physical evidence. The contradicting physical evidence is omitted in such reports. However, it is common practice in the political game called “science” to label such reports as “science” — without mentioning the omitted physical evidence. This game is commonly practiced in the US and Europe. The integrity of all of physical science is tarnished by such efforts. *********************** Importance of the Greenhouse Effect: The UN IPCC and its collaborators have condemned carbon dioxide by speculating about possible harmful effects of increasing carbon dioxide and its greenhouse effect. Their publications seldom mention the benefits of the primary greenhouse gas, water vapor, without which we probably would not have life on Earth. Nor do they mention the benefits of the secondary greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, which is essential for providing carbohydrates, the food source for all complex plants and animals. Their publications omit any benefits of the greenhouse effect itself. Starting with experiments in 1859, John Tyndall was the first to produce evidence that what he called greenhouse gases are critical for life on Earth. Without them the land masses of Earth would become too cold at night to support life as we know it. Growing plants would freeze every night. To understand the importance of the greenhouse effect for life, one needs only to compare the temperatures on Mars with those on Earth. Mars is about 1.5 times farther from the Sun than Earth. Thus, the solar radiant energy hitting it is less intense. But Earth has an albedo (reflective power) of about 30% reflecting solar radiation back to space, primarily from clouds and ice. Mars has an average albedo of around 16% primarily from dust and the composition of its surface. The daily rotation of Mars is about 24 hours and 37 minutes, a little less than 40 minutes longer than that of Earth. But it is the temperature range at the equator that is interesting. At the equator on Earth, the average daytime temperature is about 31°C (88°F). The average nighttime temperature is about 23°C (73°F). Thus, the average temperature range between daytime and nighttime is about 8°C (15°F). [Note there are other estimates that tend to give a smaller range.] At the equator on Mars daytime temperatures are around 20°C (70°F); the average nighttime temperature is about minus 70 °C (-94°F). Obviously, such cold on Earth would kill growing plants. Furthermore, although the atmosphere on Mars is thin, it is about 95% carbon dioxide. So, the runaway greenhouse effect is not occurring. https://www.space.com/16907-what-is-the-temperature-of-mars.html Some researchers such Carl Sagan falsely assumed such an effect is occurring on Venus. The overwhelming amount of the atmosphere on Venus is greenhouse gases, and the atmospheric pressure is about 92 times that on earth. If we had Venus’s quantity of greenhouse gases, they would amount to: CO2, 89,000,000 ppm (in other words 89 times our atmosphere in-toto; sulfur dioxide (SO2), 13,800 ppm; H2O, 1840 ppm, carbon monoxide (CO) 1560 ppm; hydrogen chloride (HCl), 30 ppm. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Venus The Greenhouse Effect is vital for life on Earth; without it the planet would be too cold to support life. Further, the two significant greenhouse gases, water vapor and carbon dioxide along with sunlight for photosynthesis provide carbohydrates (simple sugars), the food source for all complex plants and animals. Thanks to modern technology, we are measuring the greenhouse effect in the laboratory and in the atmosphere. Calculations of the greenhouse effect by van Wijngaarden and Happer using the HITRAN database agree well with measurements at various latitudes made by satellites. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy – Radiation Transfer *********************** Earth’s Changing Albedo? In August, Geomatics published a paper by Ned Nikolov and Karl F. Zeller titled “Roles of Earth’s Albedo Variations and Top-of-the-Atmosphere Energy Imbalance in Recent Warming: New Insights from Satellite and Surface Observations.” The abstract states: “Past studies have reported a decreasing planetary albedo and an increasing absorption of solar radiation by Earth since the early 1980s, and especially since 2000. This should have contributed to the observed surface warming. However, the magnitude of such solar contribution is presently unknown, and the question of whether or not an enhanced uptake of shortwave energy by the planet represents positive feedback to an initial warming induced by rising greenhouse-gas concentrations has not conclusively been answered. The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also did not properly assess this issue. Here, we quantify the effect of the observed albedo decrease on Earth’s Global Surface Air Temperature (GSAT) since 2000 using measurements by the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) project and a novel climate-sensitivity model derived from independent NASA planetary data by employing objective rules of calculus. Our analysis revealed that the observed decrease of planetary albedo along with reported variations of the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) explain 100% of the global warming trend and 83% of the GSAT interannual variability as documented by six satellite- and ground-based monitoring systems over the past 24 years. Changes in Earth’s cloud albedo emerged as the dominant driver of GSAT, while TSI only played a marginal role. The new climate sensitivity model also helped us analyze the physical nature of the Earth’s Energy Imbalance (EEI) calculated as a difference between absorbed shortwave and outgoing longwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere. Observations and model calculations revealed that EEI results from a quasi-adiabatic attenuation of surface energy fluxes traveling through a field of decreasing air pressure with altitude. In other words, the adiabatic dissipation of thermal kinetic energy in ascending air parcels gives rise to an apparent EEI, which does not represent “heat trapping” by increasing atmospheric greenhouse gases as currently assumed. We provide numerical evidence that the observed EEI has been misinterpreted as a source of energy gain by the Earth system on multidecadal time scales.” [Boldface added] In other words, the increase in warming that has occurred since 2000 may be from a small decrease in cloudiness, not from an increase in CO2. The CERES project, designed to measure the earth’s energy imbalance by measuring solar intensity, albedo, and outgoing IR, concluded that the “Large ASR [Absorbed Solar Radiation] trend [is] primarily driven by reductions in low and middle clouds. (https://ceres.larc.nasa.gov/documents/STM/2023-05/15_Loeb Contributed_Science_Presentation_2023.pdf) As explained by AMO physicists William van Wijngaarden and William Happer, a 1% decrease in cloudiness can cause a warming equal to that of a doubling in CO2. Further, John Robson discusses a paper by Swiss scientists suggesting sunlight hitting the earth is increasing, first from a reduction in Soviet era pollution, then from an overall decrease in cloudiness. [Robson did not link to the paper.] See links under Science: Is the Sun Rising? and Commentary: Is the Sun Rising? *********************** More Omissions: During the Biden Administration a group of economists decided to increase the mythical Social Cost of Carbon (Dioxide) (SCC). Econometrician Ross McKitrick examined their work and wrote a paper “Extended crop yield meta-analysis data do not support upward SCC revision” published by Nature, Scientific Reports. The abstract states: “The Biden Administration raised its Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) estimate about fivefold based in part on global crop yield decline projections estimated on a meta-analysis data base first published in 2014. The data set contains 1722 records, but half were missing at least one variable (usually the change in CO2) so only 862 were available for multivariate regression modeling. By re-examining the underlying sources, I was able to recover 360 records and increase the sample size to 1222. Reanalysis on the larger data set yields very different results. While the original smaller data set implies yield declines of all crop types even at low levels of warming, on the full data set global average yield changes are zero or positive even out to 5 °C warming.” [Boldface added] Judith Curry’s Climate Etc. had a post by McKitrick which explains his work in some detail. The background sections states: “In 2023 a team of economists working for the Biden Administration concluded the SCC needed to be increased by a considerable amount. The higher the SCC, the costlier the regulatory burden that can be justified by the agency. This not only affected US regulations but Canada’s as well since our own environment ministry adopted the new US values when justifying a sweeping set of new greenhouse gas regulations. I wrote an op-ed about the SCC change in May 2023 in which I drew attention to the important role played by a revision to projected agricultural yield damages. While it is difficult to trace where, precisely, all the changes came from, I estimate about $50 of an approximately $100 increase in the 2030 value of the SCC (holding the discount rate constant) was attributable to the revised agricultural yield damage estimates. These revisions were attributed to estimates of crop yield losses from a 2017 paper published in Nature Communications by Frances Moore et al. called “New science of climate change impacts on agriculture implies higher social cost of carbon.” I’ll call that paper M17. I was familiar with this paper because Kevin Dayaratna and I had studied it while preparing a response to a comment by Philip Meyer on a paper of ours on the SCC. I knew, for instance, that M17 used a data set originally developed for a 2014 paper published in Nature Climate Change by Andy Challinor et al. called “A meta-analysis of crop yield under climate change and adaptation.” I’ll refer to that one as C14. But C14 and M17 had different implications about the impact of CO2-induced warming on crop yields. In the C14 model CO2 fertilization offsets the damage from warming, whereas in M17 the combined effect is negative for most crops across most warming paths. So why the difference? It was not possible to tell simply by reading the papers. Neither one provided a detailed explanation of its regression analysis. M17, in particular, did not report its regression results nor was its model directly comparable to C14. So, in 2023 I decided to get the data and try to replicate both sets of findings. While both papers said the data was available online at a website called http://www.ag-impacts.org no such site currently exists, and the Wayback machine entries did not include any data. I emailed Moore to ask for her data, but she was at that time working for the Biden Administration and her university email was inactive. I then reached out to Challinor who replied promptly and sent me his data set.” McKitrick explains the misleading dataset he terms as C14. He then explains the slow review process in which his paper was rejected by Nature Climate Change and the slow review by Nature Scientific Reports. The paper was finally published by Nature Scientific Reports on February 15, after the new US administration took office. McKitrick states: “Of course, the topic has now been rendered somewhat moot by the Trump Administration’s January 20 Executive Order suspending the SCC on the grounds that it is “marked by logical deficiencies, a poor basis in empirical science, politicization, and the absence of a foundation in legislation.” The EPA has until mid-March to issue guidance on how to address these problems including possibly scraping the use of the SCC altogether. I have had no contact with people working on that undertaking but if any of them were to ask me I would tell them the following. Measuring the SCC is not a scientific procedure akin to measuring the weight of an atom or the speed of light. The SCC is based on so-called Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) that contain countless assumptions and yield complicated “if-then” statements. If the following assumptions are true, then a ton of CO2 emissions will cause $X worth of damage to the world. Whoever gets to pick the “If” statements determine what the “then” statement will be. And you can pick studies that guarantee any SCC value you like, although some are more plausible than others. Ultimately the SCC is determined by the political and social process of choosing who gets to write the report. The Biden-era SCC report was written by people whose antennae were up for any reasons whatsoever to boost the SCC estimate, and who ignored evidence pointing in the other direction. The report even warns the reader that they probably overlooked many reasons why the SCC is even higher than they have estimated because surely there are many other damages associated with CO2 that they have not yet thought of. (They claimed to have taken account of the benefits associated with CO2 fertilization in one of their two IAMs, but they did so based on the M17 analysis. Which means, in effect, they didn’t take it into account.) From an economic perspective, the dirty little secret of climate policy is that CO2 emission reductions are so costly, even if the US government accepted the Biden SCC estimate very few climate policies would survive a cost-benefit test, and if the SCC were lowered to something more reasonable none of them would. So, in that sense climate activists will get no joy from hanging onto the SCC. But beyond the question of what the magic SCC number should be, the bigger question is how you convince a bureaucracy not to rig the report-writing process. The 2013 Interagency Working Group SCC report boasted of consulting 11 separate government agencies, and the 2023 report additionally boasted of input from the National Academies of Science and outside expert reviewers. Yawn. The more agencies involved the less scrutiny a report gets. It is all but certain that no one checked any underlying data or undertook any replication work. And I know from experience in the IPCC and other bureaucratic processes that review comments going against a chapter author’s biases are ignored or argued away, while comments confirming an author’s biases are welcomed at face value. The scientific establishment has resisted all attempts to fix climate assessment processes because they always got to pick the authors. But now a very different team is going to do the picking. If the establishment grandees suddenly decide they don’t like the process, they should have said something sooner.”[Boldface added] See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy *********************** Which Science? Episodes such as the one experienced by McKitrick prompt one to ask: when organizations speak of science, what type of science are they referring to: Is it the science of using the scientific method to test all ideas against nature, or the science of omitting key physical evidence that contradicts the proposed idea or theory? The Royal Society is the oldest science society in the world. Elon Musk is a fellow. Jo Nova links to an article in the journal Nature which states; “The Royal Society in London has called a meeting to discuss the behavior of fellows after a growing campaign by scientists over the membership of Elon Musk. The meeting, scheduled for 3 March, comes after more than 1,300 scientists signed an open letter expressing “deep concerns” about the conduct of billionaire Musk, who is a fellow. Musk is working closely with US President Donald Trump on sweeping government reforms that threaten flagship US research programs and are causing havoc for scientists in the United States and globally. He is also accused of spreading misinformation on the social-media site X, which he owns. Two Royal Society fellows have resigned over the institution’s perceived lack of action over Musk’s behavior in recent months. ‘It is tarnishing their reputation and to some degree devalues the honor of awarding fellowships. Does one want to be associated to a society that does not stand up for its values?’ says Stephen Curry, a retired structural biologist at Imperial College London, who wrote the letter and published it on his blog on 11 February.” The Imperial College London harbors World Weather Attribution (WWA) which without physical evidence attributes severe weather events to increasing carbon dioxide. Further, Musk and his team are exposing significant funding of highly questionable political organizations in the name of science. The question is, which type of science are these members defending: the science that tests all ideas against physical evidence? or the “science” that omits key physical evidence to make a political assertion? Nova writes: “The Royal Society acts every day more and more like a trade union for approved priests of science. They reveal their small mindedness in so many ways. They accuse Musk of ‘attacking public sciences’ which begs the question of what a public science is? Is that different to real science? Or has the Royal Society totally forgotten that science is a process and not a government institution? The original full name of the Society was ‘The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge’ and no one on Earth is doing more to improve natural knowledge than Elon Musk is. And the reason he can do so much, so fast, is surely because he is funding it all himself, not waiting for government approval, appeasing bureaucrats, or cringing before ‘science’ committees with magical fashionable keywords like diversity. Musk should quit the Royal Society because it has forgotten what science is The Royal Society doesn’t know it, but they desperately need Elon Musk. The Royal Society has become nothing more than a workers’ union for government funded technicians dressed in lab coats, and he’s the greatest private scientist in the world today. He is the antidote to government funded paralysis in science (and in so many ways). Consensus ‘scientists’ are just a paid marketing wing of Big Government — captured by the monopolistic funding. The Royal Society needs Elon much more than Elon needs the Royal Society. He should quit now, before they hold their sanctimonious meeting. *UPDATE: Quitting? Nah. It only makes the Thought Police happy. Unless he has the time to excoriate them properly on the way out, it’s so much better to let them dig their own hole in public, then come crawling back when he gets to Mars. Besides, Elon has 218 million followers on X – If he wanted to set up a Society of Scientists — ones who care about the scientific method, he could do it tomorrow.” See links under Lowering Standards and Funding Issues. *********************** Failed Magic Fuel: SEPP director David Legates, and member of the Cornwall Alliance, has an essay on Master Resource “Hydrogen Energy: Not Clean, Green, Cheap.” He clearly explains the major problems involved in attempting to use hydrogen as a fuel. First, on Earth it is not a fuel. There are no hydrogen mines or fields that can be drilled. It must be extracted from H2O, natural gas (primarily CH4,) or other hydrogen compounds, at considerable cost in energy. There is significant energy loss involved in production. Second it is difficult to store because it turns most metals brittle. Third, it is difficult to transport. Fourth, it is difficult to use, it is extremely explosive. Legates concludes with: “Not Cheap Finally, the fourth hurdle should now be obvious. The use of hydrogen as a fuel source is expensive—in terms of production cost, expensive storage, and energy required to produce. Hydrogen as a fuel source will allow virtue signalers to claim they have developed and are using a ‘clean and green’ fuel source that is ‘saving the planet from the evils of fossil fuels.’ But in reality, it is only going to make energy more expensive and send a larger proportion of the planet back below the poverty line. As we have often stated here at the Cornwall Alliance, inexpensive energy has been the solution to raising billions of people above the poverty line and increasing their standard of living. Hydrogen energy will cease to become viable when the subsidies provided to it by governments of the world dry up. Hopefully, the new Administration will recognize that hydrogen embrittlement applies not just to metals, but to our economy as well.” See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy and Article #1 for the bankruptcy of the electric and hydrogen truck manufacturer Nikola. *********************** An Unraveling: Planning Engineer Russ Schussler has an essay in Climate Etc. which takes apart the erroneous thinking behind the failing green energy transition. He writes: “The purpose of this article is to summarize and debunk many of the issues in the narrative surrounding the proposed green energy transition as applies to the electric grid. The issues are so numerous that this piece is at once both too long and too short. A full unraveling deserves a book or series of books. This posting, however, challenges the narrative through summary comments with links to previous posts and articles which can be read for a more detailed explanation or for greater depth. The Narrative Efforts to hasten a ‘green transition’ find support in a powerful and compelling narrative. The following statements are widely believed, embraced and supported by various ‘experts’, a large part of the public and far too many policy makers: Schussler then debunks these claims. See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. *********************** Number of the Week: 29,000 According to the German newspaper DW translated into English: Germany has expanded wind and solar energy but failed to cut back on fossil fuel use in the transport sector. Environmental issues did not feature prominently in the election campaign — unlike the last time around. The head of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Friedrich Merz — who, according to the polls, is most likely to become the next German chancellor — has often said that Germany’s approximately 29,000 electricity-generating wind turbines are a thorn in his side. In November 2024, Merz told public broadcaster ZDF, “I even believe that if we do things right, we can one day dismantle the wind turbines again — because they are ugly.” When a high-pressure system settles over Northern Europe in the winter, producing cold, still nights; 29,000 turbines produce little electricity for Germany. When will the German public realize this? See link under The Political Games Continue. Science: Is the Sun Rising?

That’s apparent as the second Trump administration “floods the zone” with efforts to dismantle science agencies and the data and websites they use to communicate with the public. The targets range from public health and demographics to climate science. The Endangerment Finding Is in Danger. Will EPA’s Zeldin Uphold Climate Science? By Rachel Cleetus, Policy Director with the Climate and Energy program, Union of Concerned Scientists, Feb 18, 2025 If Lee Zeldin is looking for a recent authoritative assessment of the science, he should turn to the 2023 Fifth US National Climate Assessment, produced under the direction of the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP). The Global Change Research Act of 1990 mandates that the USGCRP—which collaborates across 15 federal agencies—deliver a report to Congress and the President at least every four years. Another valuable source is the IPCC sixth assessment report, which reflects the work of thousands of scientists around the world—including many from the United States—in assessing the latest climate science, impacts, and opportunities to cut heat-trapping emissions and adapt to climate change.

Why is the US giving it billions of dollars? By Robert Bryce, His Blog, Feb 18, 2025 In 2013, the World Bank declared it would stop funding coal projects and would only “in rare circumstances” provide financial support for new coal plants. It also said it would “scale up efforts to improve energy efficiency and increase renewable energy.” Rather than support coal projects, the bank said it would “scale up its work helping countries develop national and regional markets for natural gas, the fossil fuel with the lowest carbon intensity.” But two years later, the bank backtracked on natural gas and said it would stop all lending for oil and gas projects “except under exceptional circumstances.” Since then, the bank, which claims its “role is to reduce poverty by lending money to the governments of its poorer members to improve their economies and to improve the standard of living of their people,” has lost its collective mind.

They did a very, very small-scale [demonstration] of actual power beaming from orbit down to the surface a couple years ago. And what we’re actually seeing right now is that in the next five years, we’re going to have the first on-orbit power-beaming demonstrations, again, focusing on lasers, because that’s where a lot of the DOD interest is right now, and that’s where the actual funding is. But we’re going to see that you’ll have those initial demonstrators, and if you start having a market, especially for space-to-space power beaming, that could happen a lot sooner than people think, because you don’t need to have very large systems for that. Just having several kilowatts would be really helpful for certain types of applications.” [SEPP Comment: A possible source of power that may prove to be very practical in areas with few clouds, but a bit impractical perhaps for planes or birds passing through the intense beams. In the 60s (?) the idea was to beam down microwaves at about 200 W/m2, roughly 5% of that of a microwave oven, and covering large areas where the microwaves would be efficiently absorbed by “rectennas.”] Solar Energy Is Not Competitive with Fossil Fuels By Norman Rogers, Real Clear Energy, Feb 18, 2025 The size of power plants is often expressed by the maximum number of megawatts of power they are capable of delivering, called the nameplate rating. The average power delivery is less. For a natural gas plant, it is possible to generate an average power of near 100 percent of the nameplate. The plant can run continuously except for maintenance pauses. But for a solar plant the maximum capacity factor is about 25 percent in sunny areas. The low-capacity factor of solar plants, that mainly work in the middle of the day, is the reason solar is so expensive.

Nikola’s EV Truck Dream Goes Bust Another green industrial-policy project enters Chapter 11. By The Editorial Board, WSJ, Feb. 19, 2025 TWTW Summary: The editorial begins with: “Another green-energy unicorn died Wednesday as Nikola Corp., the electric-truck startup, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Its spectacular market crash is another warning about the perils of industrial policy and chasing government subsidies. The 11-year-old EV maker aspired to be the Tesla of trucks. Nikola went public in June 2020 through a blank-check merger amid the euphoric pandemic stock-market recovery and Democratic promises of a Green New Deal. It fetched a $27 billion market valuation that at the time was greater than Ford’s even though Nikola had sold no vehicles. Supposedly sophisticated investors were taken in by its marketing hype. General Motors announced on Sept. 8, 2020, that it was taking an 11% stake in Nikola, which CEO Mary Barra hailed as an “industry leading disrupter.” It was disruptive in a different way. In January 2018 Nikola posted a video on Twitter of its model truck appearing to power effortlessly down a flat road with the caption: “The Nikola Hydrogen Electric trucks will take on any semi-truck and outperform them in every category; weight, acceleration, stopping, safety and features—all with 500-1,000-mile range!” That would be a revolutionary—if true. It wasn’t. According to a 2021 federal fraud indictment of founder Trevor Milton, an inoperable prototype was towed to the top of a hill. Then Nikola employees released the brakes so it looked like it was cruising along. All the while the door was taped shut to keep it from falling off, and its batteries were removed to prevent the truck from catching fire. After taking investors for a ride, Mr. Milton was convicted in 2022. Nikola’s marketing deceptions and problems spooked investors. Nikola in 2023 recalled 209 battery-electric trucks owing to fires. As of last October, it had sold fewer than 500 trucks—and at a heavy loss. Nikola reportedly had sold hydrogen trucks for $351,000 — about half what it cost to produce them, though its sales price was still about twice as much as an internal-combustion-engine semi. This was financially unsustainable, especially amid higher interest rates. California regulators and the Biden Administration tried to boost the electric-truck market with mandates and subsidies. The Inflation Reduction Act includes a $40,000 tax credit for buyers of electric trucks. An Environmental Protection Agency rule last spring requires that electric models make up 25% of long-haul tractor sales by 2032. But the government still couldn’t induce truckers to buy them. “Like other companies in the electric vehicle industry, we have faced various market and macroeconomic factors that have impacted our ability to operate,” Nikola CEO Stephen Girsky said on Wednesday. Translation: High costs and technological limitations make EVs impractical for long-distance trucking operations.” Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.

Despite the tanking of the economy by divers means, mainly taxation, some are still prepared to engage in blatant doublethink. Recently Guido had this: “Rachel Reeves has been warned she must “urgently” boost the economy after her tax hikes triggered the sharpest collapse in business output and profits since the pandemic. A damning report from the CBI predicts another significant fall in private sector activity over the next three months (-23%), with the “pessimism widespread” https://order-order.com/2025/01/27/british-businesses-sees-biggest-hit-to-profit-and-output-since-covid/ That same CBI says… “Britain’s net zero economy is booming, CBI says Green sector growing at triple the rate of the UK economy, providing high-wage jobs and increasing energy security … The analysis showed economic growth and climate action go together, said the report’s authors, and improve lives and livelihoods. https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/24/britain-net-zero-economy-booming-cbi-green-sector-jobs-energy-security On the one hand an economy going into needless recession and on the other a boom in green… To quote Rachel from Accounts: “There is no tradeoff between economic growth and net zero. Quite the opposite. Net zero is the industrial opportunity of the 21st century” And to quote John Lennon: “Just gimme some truth”. “Most researchers are no doubt scrupulous” I’m not this is true (any more). At every level they are encouraged to be less than truthful. This starts with funding proposals, in which they feel compelled to exaggerate, often wildly, the significance and impact of what they propose. The buzzwords change constantly, eg “paradigm shifting” becomes so yesterday and is replaced by “transformative” or some other vacuous term. The publication process has become a game. It is not to be taken seriously. It’s difficult to get informed, balanced, intelligent reviews any more in most journals, especially the interdisciplinary journals. Reviewers are often antagonistic for no reason, frequently ignorant of the techniques employed, and unable to judge the merits or spot fundamental flaws. This makes the process somewhat of a lottery, with of course some biases. Editors don’t by and large make editorial decisions any longer. They hide behind reviewers without bothering to make sense of comments and responses themselves. With the right recipe in terms of topic, techniques and writing style, it’s perfectly possible to get papers into top journals often by simply bamboozling reviewers with technical jargon and exaggerated claims. Just keep submitting and some will slip through. If you look more closely, you will find most papers suffer from outright fakery or data manipulation, or lies by omission. For example, there are countless papers in so called top journals like Nature using machine learning, especially deep learning, in which it is obvious that the authors don’t understand the techniques, have applied them to ill suited problems, and have misinterpreted or manipulated the results. This sort of thing would be resoundingly mocked by a specialist journal as an example of what not to do. Do the authors know what they’re doing? Of course they do. The PhDs, postdocs and supervisors are all aware that they shouldn’t be using techniques they don’t fully understand, but they do it anyway to ride the the latest fashion. By the way, I don’t blame the junior ones too much, this is the culture in which they’ve been trained and come of age . This is the sort of dishonesty that is most common, and it is rife. The more serious dishonesty (plagiarism, fake data) is much rarer. The entire academic system from the focus on funding over scholarship to the corruption of journals and scientific bodies will not be easily fixed. I don’t see how it can be. Academia has attracted and awarded the wrong sort of person in the past 20 years or more. The non scholar, a natural manager rather than a researcher. These types are in charge of universities, journals editorial boards and scientific panels and bodies. These people got to where they are by focusing on the things universities value (money), moving in the right circles, timing their bandwagon jumping to perfection and by exploiting the talents of others. They have redifined what it is to be a scientist to some degree. Doing research yourself has become anathema, a waste of your valuable time, which ought to be spent polishing the funding proposal written by your postdoc. I find endeavours like retractionwatch a bit laughable. They focus on one symptom of the disease, ignoring the root cause, and manage to catch a few small fry Indians and Chinese who are playing the game devised by people operating in a different stratosphere, occasionally catching out some big names Moreover, they engage in the same sort of censorship of views that don’t fit within the consensus. At heart, they are just another parasitic organisation set up to get whatever riches they can extract can from modern day ‘science’ Vert astute observations Abbas. 🙂 When did university media departments start acting as the critical influence on research projects, results and publication? It seems to me that media releases are orchestrated even before the print on abstracts is dry these days. I don’t think that happens to be honest. They are reactive, any good news will be exploited for maximum publicity, but they play no part in the publication process. A lot of it is self promotion, driven by the academics themselves, especially on social media. Horribly narcissistic Self promotion and marketing yourself can be key to fast promotion. This is the modern way. You don’t say as a young academic I want to solve X and Y outstanding problems in my area. You pick a fashionable topic, put some spin on it to make it sound novel then aggressively market yourself internally and externally as some world leader in this thing This transparently shameless tactic can get you known by senior management – they just love this kind of thing. Combine this with good funding success and you’re on your way to fast promotion before you’ve even learned to tie your shoelaces as far as the actual research is concerned. These days it’s not good enough to be good at research and well respected in your field. It’s not easy for senior management to see that. You need a ‘vision’. Visions are things I have in my sleep, or if I were to hallucinate on acid. Real research is not needed when you have a vision. The idea goes like this. First pick the journals in which you want to publish. Then pick suitable topics and techniques. Then find some idea and keep polishing it until your turd looks like gold, and you make sure to keep repeating that it’s gold, a new kind of special gold never before discovered, more golden and shiny than conventional gold. Submit. Get all your PhDs doing this. Let them learn from each other In the old days we picked the challenges we wanted to work on, rather than the journals we wanted to publish in. People tended to publish in more specialised journals. You couldn’t bs, couldn’t bamboozle. The reviewers were experts and you couldn’t fool them all. Yes, people made claims to big up their research, but this was done in a measured way. Nobody was claiming to have revolutionised anything, unless they really did “Starting with experiments in 1859, John Tyndall was the first to produce evidence that what he called greenhouse gases are critical for life on Earth.” I’m willing to bet you can’t quote Tyndall referring to “greenhouse gases” – because he didn’t. Tyndall pointed out that without an atmosphere, plant life (and hence human life) would not be able to survive the low nighttime temperatures which would occur. Conversely, daytime maximum surface temperatures would exceed the boiling point of water. Just like the Moon! Tyndall was never silly enough to claim that increasing the amount of CO2 in air would increase the temperature. I suggest anyone who thinks I am wrong, to read “Heat – a mode of motion”, which Tyndall continuously revised after each addition, as his knowledge increased. I continue to be surprised at some of the ideas attributed to John Tyndall which are contradicted by what he wrote. But hey, others know what Tyndall thought, better than his thoughts expressed in his written work. I only know what he wrote. That’s enough for me. I’ve asked this before but I think it warrants repeating. Am I missing something with regard to the use of hydrogen as a fuel/ As I understand it, the by-product of burning hydrogen is water vapour, which apparently is a worse greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. if that’s the case (and you believe that greenhouse gasses are responsible for global warming), then what is the rationale for burning hydrogen in the first place? Alan, you’re right of course: But the UN agenda is to control the energy so to direct societies toward “progressive” ends. So it’s all about accounting for reductions in CO2 and CH4. It’s worse. Steam reformation I believe is still the only way to produce hydrogen at scale. 27% CO2 or something. The puny bits of so called green hydrogen, eg from concentrated solar, are probably not worth the effort when taking into account the whole process involved in production and transportation. Do not try to make sense of it, this would be a mistake. For goodness sake we now even have a war on nitrogen The primary source of atmospheric water vapor is evaporation from surface water which covers more than 70% of the earth’s surface. Any added contribution from human activity is trivial. Since water vapor continually condenses and evaporates at rates controlled by temperature and pressure to try and maintain a local quasi-equilibrium, the effect of any added water vapor on atmospheric concentration is not predictable. As explained by AMO physicists William van Wijngaarden and William Happer, a 1% decrease in cloudiness can cause a warming equal to that of a doubling in CO2. You don’t say? Scientists discover unexpected decline in global ocean evaporation amid rising sea temperatures While the decreasing trend in ocean evaporation may seem counterintuitive in the context of global warming, it highlights the complexity of Earth’s climate system and the intricate feedback mechanisms that govern the planet’s hydrological processes. It sure does sound counterintuitive with the global boiling narrative but it depends on the Fruitloops giving the feedback and blowing wind up my ass that they’ve got a handle on all that settled science.

Meta said that the increase aims to bring executive compensation in line with other major technology firms. It’s worth pointing out that Meta announced an increase in executive bonuses soon after it laid off nearly 3,600 employees, which is around five percent of its total workforce. Furthermore, the company has also decided to reduce its annual distribution of stock options for thousands of its regular employees. Under the new plan, Meta executives will earn a yearly bonus of 200 percent of their base salary in 2025, which is a massive jump from 75 percent last year. A committee for Meta’s board of directors approved the change in bonuses on February 13th, on the grounds that the “target total cash compensation” for its executives “was at or below the 15th percentile of target total compensation of executives holding similar positions” at rival companies. The social media giant has increased these bonuses while it is in the process of laying off five percent of its global workforce. This is despite the fact that Meta’s shares were nearly 50 percent higher over the past year, with a current stock price of nearly around $687 per share. Furthermore, the company recently announced that its fourth-quarter revenue increased 21 percent year-on-year to more than $48 billion. It’s worth mentioning that Meta has cut more than 20,000 jobs in the past few years. While Meta executives will enjoy their fat bonuses this year, the company’s regular employees will suffer. The company has slashed its annual distribution of stock options by roughly around 10 percent for its regular employees, reports The Financial Times. The exact reduction in the stock options could differ depending on where the employees are located and what their roles are in the organization. That said, the new bonus and stock plans will take effect from the 2025 performance cycle. As per a filing, the new bonus plan doesn’t apply to CEO Mark Zuckerberg. However, he doesn’t have to worry about his bottom line as he’s worth nearly $250 billion. Copyright ©2025 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Alibaba is going all in on trying to beat the US at developing AI that can reason like a human being
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/alibaba-share-price-china-ecommerce-ai-agi-tech-markets-deepseek-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-24T07:13:27Z
Full Content:
Hot stock Alibaba has set its sights beyond AI to focus on artificial general intelligence, or AGI. "We aim to continue to develop models that extend the boundaries of intelligence," said Eddie Wu, Alibaba's CEO, on Thursday. He called the pursuit of AGI the company's "first and foremost goal." AGI is AI technology that mimics human intelligence to the point that it can achieve complex cognitive tasks involving logic and reasoning. US-based companies working toward AGI include OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. Masayoshi Son, the CEO of major AI investor SoftBank, said earlier this month that he expects AGI to arrive "much earlier" than his late-2024 forecast of two to three years. Wu's statement came after Alibaba released blockbuster results on Thursday. For the quarter ending in December, Alibaba posted an 8% rise in revenue to 280.2 billion yuan, or $38.6 billion. Profit rose to 48.9 billion yuan, beating analysts' expectations. "The pursuit of AGI can contribute immense business value," said Wu, citing studies indicating that AGI — when achieved — could replace or achieve 80% of human capabilities. He said about 50% of global GDP comes from wages for blue- and white-collar work. "If AGI can be achieved, then that could have a tremendous impact in terms of the restructuring industry around the world. It could have a significant influence on or even replace 50% of global GDP," he said. On Monday, Alibaba announced that it's planning to invest at least 380 billion Chinese yuan, or $53 billion, in cloud computing and AI infrastructure over the next three years. The company is in a crowded global race for AI supremacy as US tech giants ramp up their AI spending. According to recent earnings reports, the combined capital expenditures of Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta are set to exceed $320 billion in 2025. Amazon is leading the charge, with over $100 billion earmarked for capital expenditures this year. The vast majority will go toward expanding Amazon Web Services and scaling AI infrastructure, the company said. However, the dramatic rise of DeepSeek, which released a new cost-competitive AI model last month, has thrown Chinese tech companies into the spotlight and caused investors to question whether massive Big Tech AI investments are justified. US-listed Alibaba shares are up 70% this year to date, thanks to the boost from DeepSeek and after Alibaba announced that it was working with Apple to incorporate its AI into iPhones in China. The upswing marks a major turnaround after Beijing's yearslong Big Tech regulatory crackdown, when cofounder Jack Ma's tech empire came under intense scrutiny. Last week, Chinese leader Xi Jinping met with the country's top tech leaders — including Ma — in a sign that the country's private sector is now back in favor again. The market is viewing the meeting as a possible end of the crackdown. The Chinese government is seemingly working to revive an economy disrupted by a pandemic, regulatory crackdowns, and a real estate crisis, wrote Deutsche Bank analysts in a note last week following the event. On Monday, Hong Kong-listed Alibaba shares were 2.5% lower by midday after recent gains and as Asian stocks were broadly pressured by sharp losses in the US markets on Friday. Jump to

Title: Ecwid
URL: https://me.pcmag.com/en/old-e-commerce-software/28549/ecwid
Time Published: 2025-02-23T15:00:14Z
Full Content:
Ecwid should be on your radar if you want to sell digital or physical goods online, particularly if you're a newcomer to the e-commerce space. The platform differentiates itself from the competition via several notable features, including excellent website design tools, rich tutorials that quickly get you started making money online, and the ability to embed your store on third-party websites like Amazon, eBay, and Google Shopping. However, two caveats prevent it from climbing into the category's upper echelon: an extremely limited free tier and a lack of 24/7 customer support across its four plans. For more feature robust services that have 24/7 customer support, check out our Editors' Choice winners for e-commerce platforms, Shopify and Wix Stores. Ecwid has four tiers: Free, Venture, Business, and Unlimited. Ecwid is one of the few e-commerce platforms with a free option, but the plan is quite limited. It restricts you to just five store items and email-based customer support. By comparison, Square Online offers a strong free tier that supports unlimited items and phone-based help (Monday to Friday, 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. PT). On the upside, you can advertise your Ecwid-powered site through Google, Meta, and Pinterest (TikTok advertising is locked behind the paid tiers), and get a free domain. The Venture plan ($25 per month or $21 per month with an annual plan) lets you store up to 100 total products in your online store, leverage live chat support when you have a question, sell on Facebook and Instagram, track inventory, and access Ecwid's mobile companion apps. The Business package ($45 per month or $39 per month with an annual plan) builds upon Venture with a 2,500-product inventory, the ability to sell via various online marketplaces (like Amazon, eBay, and Google Shopping), abandoned cart emails, wholesale pricing, and phone support. The Unlimited hosting level ($105 per month or $89 per month with an annual plan) removes the inventory cap, which is great for businesses with large product catalogs. In addition, you can integrate your Ecwid account with POS systems (like Alice, Clover, and Square) and enjoy priority customer support. Ecwid has zero transaction fees. However, the paid plans lack free trials. On the other hand, the Editors' Choice-winning Shopify (starting at $29 per month) offers unlimited products and 24/7 customer service across the board. You should check out that top pick, depending on your budget and the number of items you'd like to sell. Ecwid's sign-up process is extremely fast and easy; you just create credentials and name your shop. If you're new to Ecwid or e-commerce, the dashboard sets you up for success with a six-step tutorial on launching a shop and a 10-minute video that walks you through critical features. In the catalog tab, you add products, create product categories, and whip up gift cards (gift cards are limited to paid plans). Adding products is simple: You drag and drop product images directly into the window and optionally upload a product video. You feel the Free tier's limitations here, as inventory tracking and the ability to set stock numbers are locked behind the paid tiers. For example, if you only have five band shirts in stock, you cannot highlight to customers how many are available before they sell out. Likewise, uploading a product video is locked to the Business and Unlimited tiers. The Ecwid dashboard lets you create your shop's skeleton before entering the full editor. There, you'll find editing options for image and video sizes, image aspect ratios, data displayed on your product cards, and how you want your customers to navigate your store. In a nice touch, Ecwid lets you preview the changes as you implement them. Then, you choose a template from 73 premade ones. That's low compared with Wix Stores, which has nearly 1,000. Once a template is selected, you make changes using the full editor. The customization options are plentiful and, most importantly, intuitive. They let you update the site copy, swap images, and choose how products are displayed. Another welcome feature is the ability to switch templates even after going live. This isn't commonplace. For example, Wix Stores requires you to rebuild the site to switch to a new template. Although slightly bifurcated design tools risk confusion, Ecwid makes it seamless and easy to understand. It puts the right tools in the right sections and gives you many useful tutorials on tailoring your store. Afterpay, AmazonPay, Clover, PayPal, and Square are just five of the 61 payment gateways compatible with Ecwid. There's even a crypto.com option if that's your thing. If you use a supported payment gateway, follow the setup instructions to create an account and link your bank account. The knowledge base articles offer assistance when it comes time to get started with payments. Ecwid partners with Square and the physical Square Reader for in-person sales. Square is one of the most common and reliable physical POS systems on the market, so it's good that your Ecwid account syncs with the company's hardware. Shopify also handles both in-person and online transactions. You can accept bank transfers, cash on delivery, phone orders (which Volusion also supports), and check and money orders. Ecwid has a companion app for Android and iOS. The useful dashboard elements (ease of use, simple navigation) also apply to its mobile offering. The apps display your reports, lets you add products, and create barcodes for those products with your phone's camera. The ability to create barcodes is a unique feature and one we hope more e-commerce services integrate in the future. With the Ecwid apps, your shop is truly in the palm of your hand. In addition to adding products, you can manage orders, create discounts, set up payments, and manage the settings on your various sales channels (like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok). Free-tier subscribers can test the app with a 28-day trial. Paid users have app access included with their subscriptions. Ecwid offers phone and chat-based customer support—if you're using the Business or Unlimited plan. The Free tier lacks live support (you must visit the aforementioned user forums and help pages), while the Venture tier supports web chat but not phone help. We're not fans of this tiered-based assistance. In addition, you can only receive a call back after you place a request via chat. In short, Ecwid's customer service is needlessly limited. On the upside, phone support is available 24 hours per day (Monday to Friday). Starting a business online can be stressful, and e-entrepreneurs want to hit the ground running with as few bumps as possible. On that note, Ecwid surprised us with its sleek interface, robust tutorials, and easy-to-use website editor. That said, the Free plan is far too limited, and the tiered customer support is a notable drawback of an otherwise positive experience. If you want more robust e-commerce options, check out our Editors' Choice winners Shopify and Wix Stores. Mike Williams contributed to this review.

Target (TGT+0.86%) was hit with another lawsuit on Thursday, this time by the state of Florida, which accused the retail giant of hiding the risks tied to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts. The state claims these initiatives sparked a customer backlash that erased billions of dollars from Target’s market value. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Fort Myers, Florida, was brought by the State Board of Administration of Florida, an agency responsible for managing public pension funds, which hold Target stock. Florida alleges that Target misled investors and alienated its core customer base by making false and misleading statements in its financial reports about its DEI and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) mandates. The lawsuit also targets Target CEO Brian Cornell, accusing him of downplaying the scope of customer boycotts following the company’s Pride Month campaign in May 2023. The state claims these boycotts contributed to a prolonged decline in Target’s share price. Target did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The lawsuit is being represented by Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier and America First Legal, a group led by President Donald Trump’s advisor, Stephen Miller. “Corporations that push radical leftist ideology at the expense of financial returns jeopardize the retirement security of Florida’s first responders and teachers,” Uthmeier said in a statement. “My office will stridently pursue corporate reform so that companies get back to the business of doing business — not offensive political theatre.” This is America First Legal’s second lawsuit against Target. Earlier this month, the City of Riviera Beach Police Pension Fund in Florida filed a similar lawsuit. The legal actions come as Target, along with other major corporations such as Walmart (WMT+3.80%), McDonald’s (MCD+0.85%), and Meta (META-1.36%), have recently scaled back their DEI initiatives.

dustman81: Looking at the Meta layoffs, looks to me that they laid off for two reasons:1. Replace US citizens/green card holders with Chinese and Indian H1-Bs who work for peanuts2. Part of a Meta employee's comp is in RSUs (Restricted Stock Units). Employees who were hired during the Great Resignation had the value of their RSUs skyrocket in the previous two years as Meta's stock price skyrocketed, which cost the company money when the RSUs vested. The latest crop of hires have their RSUs set at the current, higher valuation, which will cost the company less (or possibly nothing if the stock value goes down in the meantime). mr0x: dustman81: Looking at the Meta layoffs, looks to me that they laid off for two reasons:1.

At least for engineering roles, Meta pays *extremely* well2. RSU compensation goes on the company's books when they are granted, not when they vest. It doesn't become income for an employee until it vests, though. It's also almost purely an accounting charge for the company since trillion dollar companies aren't granting enough stock to have any kind of dilutive effect anyways. dustman81: Suflig: What do you think the point of a business Meta existing IS?So Zuckerbot can buy more $900,000 watches, $300 million yachts, and $50 million private jets?
