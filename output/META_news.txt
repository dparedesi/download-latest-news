However, we recommend you snag them fast since the best Cyber Monday gaming deals are likely going to expire after today. Gaming consoles, Switch accessories, and PC peripherals are all on sale for all-time low prices. The highly-coveted PS5 Digital Edition is $75 off. Meanwhile, you can save $50 on the Xbox Series X Digital Edition. PC gamers can also secure deep discounts on powerful gaming laptops, like this Dell system with an Intel Core i9 and RTX 4070 for $200 off. Find the best Cyber Monday gaming deals on products we recommend below. If you're gift shopping, check out our guide to the best Cyber Monday deals for sales across all categories, including home, kitchen, tech, and more. For Cyber Monday, Nintendo is offering a great bundle that includes a Switch console, a free copy of Mario Kart 8, and a one-year Nintendo Switch online membership. The bundle was available for $50 off, but that deal sold out. However, even at full price the bundle still saves you about $80 compared to buying the console, game, and membership separately. This bundle includes a standard Nintendo Switch console, a download code for Mario Kart 8, and a 12-month membership to Nintendo Switch online. Even at full price, this package already saves you about $80 compared to buying the console, game, and subscription separately. Highlights Inspired by Nintendo's popular Legend of Zelda franchise, this bundle includes a gold-colored Switch Lite console and a 12-month membership to Nintendo Switch Online. The typical combined price of both items would be $250, so this bundle saves you around $40. The 8BitDo Ultimate is comfortable, highly customizable, and comes with a convenient charging dock. The PowerA Enhanced Wired Controller for Nintendo Switch is a full-sized gamepad that offers bigger buttons, better joysticks, and extra customizable buttons. The Spectra model also has color-changing LED lights. The Tomtoc Carrying Case comes with an integrated stand that lets you play your Switch while charging it. This Ivoler case can be carried with a handle or shoulder strap. It's big enough to fit a Switch, dock, controller, and 18 game cards. Microsoft is offering an excellent selection of Cyber Monday gaming deals, including discounts on various Xbox consoles and accessories. The Xbox Series X Digital Edition is down to an all-time low of $398 while the 512GB Xbox Series S is $50 off at Walmart. This Series X model offers the same graphical performance as the standard edition but it does not include a disc drive. It typically costs $50 less than the disc-drive model. The Xbox Series S isn't as powerful as the Series X, but it still benefits from Xbox Game Pass and Microsoft's robust online services, offering great value for less money. The iconic Xbox Core controller works with various Xbox systems, but it can also connect to your PC, iPhone, iPad, or Android. Microsoft’s official battery pack for the Xbox wireless controller replaces the standard AA batteries and can be charged with the controller’s usual USB cable. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X shares many features with the more expensive Nova Pro, like a noise-canceling microphone and wireless cross-platform support, while maintaining a midrange price. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate offers a Netflix-style subscription with hundreds of games for Xbox and PC, along with online multiplayer support. Members can also stream games on mobile devices, Samsung TVs, and select Fire TV sticks. An Ultimate membership typically costs $20, but most retailers sell one month for $17. PlayStation 5 systems and accessories are seeing great discounts for Cyber Monday. The Digital Edition console is down to a new low of $374. Meanwhile, the PS5 with disc drive is available for $75 off, and this PS VR2 bundle is a whopping $250 off. And though not discounted, the brand-new PS5 Pro is in stock for its regular price of $699. The PS5 is one of the best gaming consoles you can buy thanks to its powerful hardware, unique controller, and exclusive games. This model includes a disc drive and some free Fortnite content, like in-game outfits and weapons. The PS5 Slim Digital Edition doesn't include a disc drive, but you can buy one later on for $80 if you decide you want to play game discs later on. This package features some Fortnite-related freebies, including in-game outfits and weapons. This bundle includes a slim disc-drive edition PlayStation 5 console with a copy of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the latest entry in the popular action RPG franchise. With this bundle, buyers get a slim PlayStation 5 console with disc drive and a copy of Madden NFL 25, the latest game in the long-running football series. The PS VR2 is a virtual reality headset built for the PS5. It also supports a PC adapter (sold separately for $60) that can pair with computers to play SteamVR games. This bundle includes a copy of Horizon Call of the Mountain. Sony's DualSense controller improves on the classic PlayStation design with haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, USB-C, charging, a built-in mic, and a longer battery life. These wireless earbuds are designed for gaming with a PS5 or PC. They support active noise cancellation and a 2.4GHz wireless connection for lag-free playback. This wired gaming headset has a white color scheme that's designed to match the PS5 console. It has a boom microphone for voice chat that can be flipped up to mute. You can now snag a Quest 3S bundle that includes the 128GB headset, the new Batman: Arkham Shadow game, and a three-month Meta Quest+ subscription for a total of $299. You can learn more about the 3S VR headset in our Meta Quest 3S review. The Quest 3S is Meta's most affordable VR headset. It has the same chipset and gaming performance as the pricier Quest 3, but its display isn't as sharp. This is an excellent fit for casual users who want a more budget-friendly entry into the world of VR. This is a great time to buy, as you'll get a free download of the Batman: Arkham Shadow game (worth $50) and three months of Meta Quest+ (worth $24). The larger 256GB model of the new Quest 3S is for the more dedicated VR fan keen on downloading and storing a larger number of games and apps at once. VR newcomers would be better off saving some cash with the 128GB model in our book, though. Otherwise, you're getting the same excellent value headset, and all purchases currently include a code for the super-fun Batman: Arkham Shadow game (a $50 value). You're also getting three months of Meta Quest+ (worth $24). The slightly older Meta Quest 3 VR headset builds on its predecessor with mixed reality capabilities, 4K resolution, an upgraded processor that offers double the speed, and new ergonomics for the head unit and controllers. Like the newer 3S model it also comes with a free download code for the new Batman: Arkham Shadow VR game (worth $50). The larger 512GB version is the only one remaining, as the smaller ones have now been discontinued. PC and laptop gamers can save tons on new systems during Cyber Monday. Right now, the Asus TUG A15 gaming laptop is down to $999 which is just $20 more than the lowest price it's ever dipped to. We're also seeing great deals on monitors, like this 50% discount on Samsung's 43-inch Odyssey Neo G7. The Asus TUF is built with military-grade shock resistance, and its incredibly powerful battery can last for around nine hours on a single charge. This model of the X16 R2 by Asus has powerful specs to run almost any demanding game at high frames-per-second on its large 16-inch QHD 240Hz display. Alienware's AW3225QF is the first 4K QD-OLED monitor and one of the few 4K displays you can get with a 240Hz refresh rate. It's expensive but delivers stunning performance while setting a new benchmark for gaming displays. The Samsung Odyssey Neo series offers 4K image quality in a sleek and stylish package. They’re among the best gaming monitors on the market. The Asus ROG Ally is a handheld gaming PC with Windows 11. Its hardware is powerful enough to run nearly any game, but its control issues make it awkward to use. The Razer Basilisk V3 Pro delivers smooth movement, cool RGB lighting, plenty of buttons, and a high-quality design that feels great in-hand. It’s our pick for the best wireless gaming mouse you can buy. The Logitech G305 Lightspeed is an excellent choice for entry-level users, casual gamers, and those shopping on a budget. Despite being one of the most affordable wireless gaming mice on the market, it doesn't compromise quality or performance, and it's almost always on sale. See more of our Cyber Monday roundups The PS5 and Xbox Series X are both powerful gaming consoles with similar graphical capabilities. However, they each have pros and cons. Our gaming experts think the PS5 has an edge in exclusive games, with franchises like Marvel's Spider-Man, The Last of Us, God of War, Ratchet & Clank, Astro Bot, and Ghosts of Tsushima that you can't play on Xbox systems. We also prefer the PS5's DualSense controller since it has extra perks like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. Xbox consoles have their own exclusive titles as well, including Halo and Starfield, but the selection isn't as large and Microsoft is starting to experiment with releasing some of its first-party games on the PS5. However, the Xbox Series X has an edge in multimedia capabilities and its Game Pass subscription service, which offers tons of titles, including brand-new releases the day they launch in stores. Ultimately, you can't go wrong with either system, but the PS5's exclusive titles and unique controller make it a slightly better option for gamers who don't want to miss out on big releases. Check out our PS5 vs. Xbox Series X comparison for more details. Top gaming PCs and laptops feature components built to handle modern games at stable frame rates, along with support for features like ray tracing and AI upscaling. This makes them notably more expensive than typical computers designed for everyday use. High-end gaming desktops and laptops can cost more than $3,000 but entry-level options with solid specifications can be found for around $800 to $1,000. When shopping for a gaming computer the most important spec to look at is the graphics card. Nvidia and AMD are the top brands in graphics cards, and they both sell excellent options. However, Nvidia's top GPUs are typically more powerful, and the company's RTX 40-series cards have a feature called "Deep Learning Super Sampling" (DLSS), which can improve frame rates with AI. Meanwhile, AMD's graphics cards tend to be a little less powerful by are also often less expensive. For the best gaming performance, we recommend focusing on PCs and laptops that have an Nvidia RTX 4050 graphics card or higher. Shopping for more discounts today?

Title: Improving prediction accuracy in agricultural markets through the CIMA-AttGRU model
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0313066
Time Published: 2024-12-02T14:00:00Z

In the Chinese futures market, agricultural product futures play a crucial role. While previous studies have primarily relied on historical price data and fundamental financial indicators of agricultural product futures, there is a growing recognition of the value that lies within the vast amounts of textual data generated in the financial domain. Our study specifically focuses on the limitations of existing methods in capturing the complex relationships and rich semantic information embedded in these textual sources. This article designs a CIMA AttGRU (CIMA-AttGRU) model for soybean futures, which is a forecasting method for the agricultural product market. This model uniquely integrates Collective Intrinsic Mode Analysis (CIMA) with an Attention-Gated Recurrent Unit (AttGRU), leveraging the strengths of both techniques to enhance predictive accuracy and adaptability. The rationale behind employing the CIMA-AttGRU model lies in its ability to effectively tackle the inherent challenges of financial market analysis. By incorporating CIMA, the model adeptly filters out market noise, directly addressing the challenge of high volatility. Additionally, with its attention mechanism, the CIMA-AttGRU targets the issue of non-linear patterns by allowing dynamic adjustment to temporal dependencies, offering differential learning capabilities crucial for capturing the nuanced fluctuations in futures prices. Complementing the CIMA and AttGRU, the integration of Class-wise Adversarial Domain Adaptation (CADA) further refines the model’s robustness, addressing the critical challenge of domain adaptivity. This aspect is particularly vital for edamame futures, where price determinants can vary significantly over time and across regions. Our empirical results demonstrate a significant improvement in forecasting precision, with the CIMA-AttGRU model achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) reduction of 15% and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) reduction of 20% compared to conventional models. This superior performance, especially in terms of prediction accuracy and handling market fluctuations, highlights the improve of the model compared to existing methods and has made significant explorations in agricultural market forecasting.

The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. In the diverse landscape of China’s futures market, agricultural product futures occupy a pivotal position, reflecting their significant influence on both the economy and food security [1]. Among these products, edamame stands out due to its unique position in the market and its broader implications on economic trends [2]. Traditionally, stock market analysis has relied heavily on quantitative financial data. However, the increasing availability of textual data, such as earnings call transcripts, financial news, and social media discussions, presents an untapped opportunity to enhance market prediction accuracy. This study explores the integration of natural language processing techniques with financial data analysis to leverage the semantic content of textual data for improved stock price volatility forecasting. Considering the close relationship between the prices of edamame futures and their spot market values, we posit that accurate forecasting of edamame futures prices is a critical yet challenging endeavor, amplified by the commodity’s unique market dynamics. This correlation implies that fluctuations in the spot market can have immediate and significant impacts on futures prices, necessitating a nuanced approach to prediction. The futures market, characterized by its nonlinear trends and volatile patterns, demands advanced forecasting methods. In this regard, the advent of deep learning has marked a significant advancement. Deep learning, especially models designed for nonlinear time series prediction, offers robust tools for deciphering the complex patterns inherent in futures prices [3]. However, traditional models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) [4] encounter challenges such as vanishing and exploding gradients, particularly with extended time series data. This limitation highlights the necessity for innovative deep learning approaches, perhaps incorporating techniques like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks [5] or attention mechanisms [6], which are better equipped to manage the complexities of long-term futures price prediction and could provide more accurate and reliable forecasts for stakeholders in the edamame market. To address the limitations of traditional RNNs, LSTM units were developed, which enhance RNNs with gate units and an additional input variable to combat the vanishing gradient problem. While LSTMs alleviate the short-term memory limitations of RNNs, their complex structure of four fully connected layers can result in increased training times and a higher parameter count. In response, Gate Recurrent Units (GRU) [7] were proposed as an evolution of LSTM. GRUs streamline the architecture by combining the hidden layer and cell state and reducing the number of gate units to two. Empirical studies have demonstrated that GRUs can outperform RNNs and LSTMs in terms of parameter update speed and training efficiency, achieving similar predictive results with greater efficiency. However, both LSTM and GRU models, despite their advancements over RNNs, face challenges in capturing complex relationships in extended data series. They often struggle to extract pivotal internal correlations and identify significant feature combinations for accurate prediction. To overcome this, we introduce the AttGRU model, which incorporates an Attention mechanism within the GRU framework. This integration enables the AttGRU to focus more effectively on relevant features and internal correlations, thereby enhancing its learning capabilities from historical data. Despite these improvements, handling random noise in historical data remains a significant challenge. To tackle this issue, we employ CIMA for its efficacy in noise reduction. The proposed hybrid CIMA-AttGRU prediction model combines the noise-filtering capabilities for CIMA with the advanced feature extraction and focus of AttGRU. This synergistic approach allows for more nuanced and accurate predictions in the futures market, addressing both the intricacies of the data and the inherent noise, and setting a new benchmark in futures price forecasting. Furthermore, we tackle the challenge of data migration in time series analysis, a common occurrence in futures markets where changes over time can lead to domain shifts. Domain shifts refer to the scenario where the statistical properties of the data change, which can significantly impact the accuracy of predictive models. To address this, we introduce the CADA algorithm. CADA enhances the robustness of the feature extractor against these domain variances. It operates by aligning the current training data more closely with future data projections, ensuring that the model remains effective even as the underlying data evolves over time. The model’s efficacy is rigorously benchmarked against 13 comparative models, using metrics such as MAE [8], Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) [9], and the coefficient of determination (R2) [10]. The empirical findings underscore CIMA- AttGRU’s superiority in prediction accuracy. These results highlight its effectiveness in accurately capturing the complex dynamics of the edamame futures market. For market stakeholders, the CIMA-AttGRU model presents a more robust tool for navigating market volatility, enabling more precise risk management, and facilitating informed decision- making. The principal contributions of this study are manifold: Time series forecasting, a critical component across various domains such as meteorology, finance, energy, and healthcare, has seen significant advancements with the adoption of deep learning, probabilistic modeling, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning. The Transformer architecture, initially designed for natural language processing, has been adapted to capture long-range dependencies in time series data [11], with studies exploring its effectiveness and efficiency [12, 13]. Probabilistic models like Bayesian time series and Gaussian Processes offer insights into the uncertainty of future observations, with recent innovations integrating deep learning to enhance forecasting capabilities [14]. The exploration of reinforcement learning for dynamic model adjustment [15] and meta-learning for few-shot learning scenarios [16] represent novel directions aiming at adaptability and generalization. Hybrid models combine traditional statistical methods with machine learning to capture both linear and non-linear patterns, demonstrating the synergy between ARIMA and neural networks, as well as the potential of deep learning architectures in ensemble models for improved accuracy [17]. Specific domain applications highlight the impact of advanced forecasting models in finance for predicting market trends [18], in energy for renewable energy management and load forecasting [19], and in healthcare for predicting disease outbreaks and patient admissions [20]. This evolving field continues to explore the intersection of diverse methodologies, reflecting the complex nature of time series data and the need for innovative forecasting models. Transitioning to a different approach, Yao et al.’s investigation into egg price forecasting using AutoRegressive (AR) models offers a contrasting perspective [21]. Yao et al.’s research highlights the significant influence of external factors, such as market policies and environmental changes, on futures prices. This finding underscores the necessity of considering such variables in predictive analyses to capture the full spectrum of influences affecting commodity prices. The application of RNNs in processing time series data, as demonstrated in Huang and Yu’s stock index predictions, has shown significant ad- vantages due to their ability to capture temporal dependencies. However, RNNs face challenges like the ‘vanishing gradient’ and ‘exploding gradient’ problems, which impede their effectiveness, especially with long-term data dependencies. Addressing these issues, Ouyang et al. proposed the Short-term Time Series Network (LSTNet), which effectively circumvents these limitations and outperforms both ARIMA and traditional RNNs models in agricultural product futures price prediction [22]. Wang and Gao’s research further asserts the superiority of LSTM models in time series pre- diction, despite challenges in training stability. Similarly, Huang and Yong successfully used Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) alongside LSTM for crude oil price prediction, emphasizing the critical role of optimal hyperparameter tuning [23]. Amalia et al. compared LSTM and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) models in agricultural product price prediction, finding that GRUs offer advantages in terms of speed and accuracy [24]. Peng et al. introduced an innovative CNN-GRU-Attention combination model for water source quality forecasting. This model leverages the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), GRU, and Attention mechanisms, demonstrating its superiority over other techniques in capturing complex patterns [25]. Finally, Yang et al. combined GRU and Attention mechanisms for individual stock predictions, showcasing the efficacy of integrating these advanced models to improve predictive accuracy [26]. The advancement of machine learning models in the domain of financial market analysis has seen significant contributions from various baseline models, each offering unique insights into time series forecasting and domain adaptation. Notably, models like LSTM [27] and GRU [28] have been instrumental in capturing temporal dependencies in market trends, while SVR [29] has provided robust solutions for nonlinear pattern recognition in price fluctuations. Additionally, attention-based models such as AttGRU [30], alongside innovative architectures like RainDrop [31] and SimTSC [32], have enhanced model sensitivity to crucial time series features. The LB-SimTSC [33] and TodayNet [34] further exemplify the integration of domain adaptation strategies, improving model robust- ness across different market conditions. Complex models incorporating multiple attention mechanisms, such as Attention-GRU [35], Attention-LSTM [36], and Attention-AttGRU [37], represent the forefront of leveraging deep learning to understand and predict agricultural market dynamics effectively. These models collectively contribute to the foundation upon which our study builds, aiming to enhance predictive accuracy and adaptability in forecasting edamame futures prices. The evolution of deep neural networks (DNNs) has significantly impacted domain adaptation (DA), a process critical in applications such as cross-domain image classification and person re-identification. This process involves modifying models to perform accurately across varying domains. Tzeng et al. have advanced this field by integrating adaptation layers into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which facilitate the extraction of domain- invariant features, essential for models to perform consistently across different domains [38]. Furthering this development, Long et al. combined Joint Maximum Mean Discrepancy (JMMD) with CNNs, a method that reduces disparities between different domain distributions, thereby enhancing the model’s ability to generalize across domains [39]. Deng et al. introduced an innovative approach, Cluster Alignment with a Teacher (CAT), which marks a significant contribution to DA by aligning data clusters in a teacher-student model framework, enhancing the model’s adaptability to new domains [40]. Our research is inspired by the adversarial learning-based DA, particularly Ganin et al.’s Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN). DANN employs an adversarial approach to train models to be domain-agnostic, thereby improving their performance across different domains [41]. This concept was further expanded by Long et al., who developed conditional domain adversarial networks. These networks refine the adversarial approach by conditioning the training process on domain-specific information, leading to more effective domain adaptation [42]. The cornerstone of our research lies in the development and application of the CIMA- AttGRU model, a pioneering approach designed to address the intricate dynamics of agricultural market trends, particularly in the context of edamame futures prices. This innovation is primarily motivated by the unique challenges posed by agricultural production’s pronounced seasonality and cyclicity. Recognizing the critical influence of these factors on price volatility and trend predictability, we incorporated Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) as a strategic component of our model. EMD’s ability to decompose non-stationary and non-linear time series data into a collection of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) enables the effective separation of underlying cyclical patterns from noise, thereby facilitating a more nuanced analysis of seasonal and cyclic components inherent in agricultural data. This methodological choice is underpinned by the agricultural sector’s inherent characteristics, where production cycles are significantly influenced by seasonal variations and external climatic conditions. By applying EMD, our model gains the capacity to dissect these complex datasets into simpler oscillatory modes, each representing distinct frequency bands. This decomposition allows for the isolation and examination of seasonal effects and cyclical trends, which are pivotal for understanding and forecasting the edamame futures market’s behavior. The integration of EMD within the CIMA-AttGRU framework significantly enhances the model’s predictive performance. It does so by providing a robust mechanism for capturing and analyzing the temporal dependencies and patterns that traditional models might overlook. Furthermore, this approach empowers our model to offer insightful forecasts that are critically informed by an in-depth understanding of the agricultural market’s seasonal and cyclical dynamics, setting a new benchmark for accuracy and reliability in financial market analysis. The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a specialized subset of RNNs, is characterized by its modular neural architecture, which is specifically designed to enhance the efficiency of information processing. To provide a clearer understanding of this intricate architecture, the GRU model’s design and operational flow are depicted in Fig 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.g001 The CIMA methodology [43], which is primarily utilized for decomposing historical data into its intrinsic modes, faces inherent challenges when integrating new data sets. CIMA, known for its effectiveness in breaking down complex data into simpler components, encounters difficulties as the introduction of new data can significantly alter the results of its decomposition process. This change necessitates reprocessing by the trained model to accommodate the new information and ensure accurate decomposition. A critical aspect of this reprocessing is the increase in the number of components that the model needs to analyze and interpret. Each new data set potentially introduces additional modes or variations, thereby increasing the complexity of the decomposition. This escalation in the number of components directly correlates with an increase in processing time. Such an increase is a significant concern in time-sensitive applications, where rapid analysis and decision-making based on the latest data are crucial. The challenge, therefore, lies in balancing the accuracy and thoroughness of the CIMA methodology with the need for efficiency and speed in processing and updating the model with new data inputs. To address these challenges and optimize training efficiency, the concept of Aggregate Binary Crossings (ABC) is introduced. This measure is calculated as per the following equation: (1) The function sgn(p) is defined as: (2) ABC essentially quantifies the frequency of sign changes within each component of the data, thus serving as an indicator of data fluctuation. This metric is particularly pertinent in the context of edamame futures data. As per the documented findings in previous research. An analysis of the ABC values reveals distinct frequency characteristics across different components which is showed in Table 1. For instance, IMF1, identified as a high-frequency component, exhibits an ABC exceeding 40%. Conversely, IMF2 through IMF3 are categorized as medium-frequency components with ABC values ranging between 10% and 40%. Components IMF4 to IMF10, classified as low-frequency, have ABCs below 10% [44]. The reconstruction of these components is depicted in Fig 2. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.g002 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.t001 This approach of using ABC for component analysis not only enhances the efficiency of the CIMA methodology in processing time series data but also provides a nuanced understanding of the data’s fluctuation characteristics, crucial for accurate forecasting in financial markets like edamame futures. The Attention Gate Unit (AttGRU) architecture depicted in Fig 3 represents a significant advancement in neural network design, particularly in how it computes candidate hidden states. This modification enables the AttGRU to process sequential data with enhanced capabilities, as it integrates an Attention mechanism that selectively focuses on specific parts of the input sequence. This allows the model to capture dependencies and nuances that might be overlooked by traditional GRU frameworks. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.g003 In the advanced architecture of the Attention-based Gated Recurrent Unit (AttGRU), the dynamic interaction between the memory cell and input values plays a pivotal role. This sophisticated mechanism is articulated through two primary gates which integrate the output value from the preceding timestep, ms−1, and the contemporaneous input, ys, orchestrating the degree to which previous cognitive states are retained or discarded. This process is mathematically encapsulated as follows: (3) In this formulation, σ and φ denote the Sigmoid and Leaky ReLU activation functions, respectively. The dual-stage nature of this gate, involving and their corresponding bias terms . The algorithm for the synthetic update gate is represented as: (4) Here, the dual-stage mechanism of the update gate, employing matrices ˘ and biases , echoes the approach of the reset gate, ensuring a delicate balance between preservation and evolution of the memory state. AttGRU is formulated as: (5) In this expression, Vβ represents the weight matrix associated with the attention mechanism. The attention probabilities, Ps, are derived through the softmax function applied to the scale βs: (6) The final phase of the AttGRU’s operation involves the calculation of the candidate hidden state. The resulting combination is then weighted and summed, with the attention probability distribution, Ps, playing a crucial role. The output gate of AttGRU is delineated as follows: (7) This advanced framework, characterized by its dual-stage gates and attention-driven dynamics, embodies a significant stride in the evolution of recurrent neural network architectures, offering enhanced capabilities for processing sequential data with refined contextual awareness. In this study, we outline the comprehensive architecture of the CIMA-AttGRU model, as illustrated in Fig 4. Our research specifically focuses on analyzing edamame futures price data, a choice driven by the significant economic impact and market volatility associated with this commodity. The CIMA-AttGRU model, designed to handle the complexities of this data, is methodically segmented into six distinct components to optimize its analytical efficacy. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.g004 The inaugural segment of our model is the input layer, where we introduce the primary dataset—edamame futures prices. This layer is crucial as it sets the foundation for the model’s data processing. In addition to the primary focus, we incorporate key financial indices such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) (Fig 5), SP 500 (Fig 6), and NASDAQ (Fig 7).

Reprinted from [46] under a CC BY license, with permission from IEEE Access, original copyright 2023. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.g007 These indices are selected as external influences due to their established impact on market trends and economic indicators. Their inclusion in the input layer allows the model to contextualize the edamame price data within a broader economic landscape, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of our analysis. Fig 4 visually presents the CIMA-AttGRU model’s architecture, showcasing how each component, from the input layer to the final output, contributes to the processing and analysis of the data. This visualization is instrumental in understanding the intricate workings of the model and how it integrates various elements to provide a comprehensive analysis of edamame futures prices. The CIMA-AttGRU model’s architecture, as delineated in our study, consists of several layers, each meticulously designed to contribute to the model’s overall predictive analysis. The second tier, the data preprocessing layer, is where the raw input data is refined and prepared for analysis. This includes normalization, handling missing values, and selecting relevant features, all of which are essential for enhancing the accuracy of the predictions. The third layer is dedicated to CIMA decomposition, where the data is broken down into IMFs. These IMFs represent different frequency components in the data, and their separation is crucial for isolating distinct patterns and trends. In this phase, the AttGRU mechanism is employed to forecast each component independently, allowing for a nuanced analysis of the various elements within the dataset. Following this, the fifth layer–the combination layer–plays a vital role in bringing together the individual forecasts from each IMF. This consolidation is key to synthesizing the data into a unified analysis, ensuring that all relevant information is factored into the final prediction. The process culminates in the output layer, the final stage of the model. Here, the aggregated results from the previous layers are scaled to produce the final predictive output. This output embodies the comprehensive prediction derived from the intricate processes of the CIMA-AttGRU model, offering a well-rounded analysis based on the data. In time series analysis, there is a challenge of data migration which is a common occurrence in futures markets where changes over time can lead to domain shifts. To address this, we introduce the CADA algorithm. Within the framework of Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) training, initially conceptualized by Ganin and Lempitsky, a pivotal element is the incorporation of the marginal adversarial loss LT [41]. This loss function plays a crucial role in enabling the extraction of domain-invariant feature representations from both the source and target domains. It achieves this through adversarial learning, a process where the model is trained to minimize domain discrepancies, effectively harmonizing the marginal distributions of these domains. However, the conventional DANN model primarily focuses on aligning these domains at the level of their marginal distributions. While this approach has its merits, it can overlook the discriminative structures within the feature space. Such oversight may lead to negative transfer phenomena, where the model inadvertently adopts irrelevant or misleading features from the source domain. Our research draws upon established matrix optimization-based domain adaptation (DA) techniques to form the foundation of our proposed method. This approach is centered around the estimation of conditional distribution divergences. Specifically, it involves a detailed analysis of the variances in class conditional distributions. The subsequent sections will delve into a more comprehensive discussion on how these estimations are carried out and the implications thereof for the field of domain adaptation. In the realm of domain adaptation (DA) strategies for DNNs, which are steered by matrix optimization, the task of accurately estimating the equation outlined in Eq 9 is a formidable challenge. This equation integrates both genuine and synthetic labels, and its precise estimation is often complicated by the complexities inherent in batch sampling. These complexities chiefly stem from a potential misalignment between instances in the source and target domains. Such misalignment can skew the accuracy of estimating class-conditional distributions. Addressing this challenge, our approach introduces a selective mechanism for class subset sampling. This mechanism operates on a principle of alignment congruence; it calculates distribution distances only in instances where there is a match in label spaces between source and target domains during batch sampling. This strategic sampling approach is essential in accurately computing the loss function, which is a critical component of dependent adversarial domain adaptation. It significantly contributes to the model’s robustness and enhances its performance across varied and intricate data environments. The proposed framework, as articulated in Eq 9, involves a nuanced understanding of data instances, denoted as ZU/S,F, representing the Fth class from either source or target domain. Additionally, OF symbolizes the discriminator assigned to the Fth class. A notable aspect of this framework is the incorporation of pseudo labels from the target domain in each iteration, an approach that significantly augments the model’s precision and adaptability. To address the predictive loss aspect, we introduce a loss function specifically designed for evaluating the accuracy of time series forecasts in agricultural market trends. The predictive loss LP is formulated as follows: (10) where N is the number of forecasted points, yi represents the actual value at time i, and denotes the forecasted value. This loss function, rooted in the MSE, quantifies the deviation of the model’s predictions from the actual market outcomes, thereby guiding the optimization process towards more accurate forecasts. Incorporating LP into our domain adaptation framework, the overall objective be- comes the minimization of both domain adaptation loss and predictive loss. This dual- objective approach ensures that our model not only learns domain-invariant features but also hones its forecasting accuracy, making it particularly well-suited for predicting agricultural market trends with high precision and reliability. In conclusion, our CADA method extends the conventional DANN framework by incorporating a predictive loss component. This integration enhances the model’s capability to adapt across domains while simultaneously improving its forecasting accuracy, offering a robust solution for domain adaptation challenges in the context of agricultural market trend forecasting. The study was conducted using a computational setup comprised of a Windows 10 operating system. The hardware included an Intel(R) Core (TM) i7 CPU, an NVIDIA GTX4090 graphics card, and 24.00 GB of RAM. For software, Python 3.9 served as the programming language, with PyCharm utilized as the development environment. Data for this analysis was sourced from the Tushare platform, an open-access repository for financial big data. The study focused on key financial indices, U.S. Dollar Index (USDX), and NASDAQ. To assess the interrelations among these indices, the Maximum Information Coefficient (MaxIC) was employed in Table 2. This MaxIC is particularly adept at handling nonlinear data relationships. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.t002 For a pair of variables (A, B), the methodology involves partitioning them into p and q intervals along their respective axes, thereby creating a grid of pq cells. Given a dataset of these two-dimensional variables, the MaxIC is computed as follows: (11) In this formula, MaxICMaxIC(A,B) signifies the maximum information coefficient for the variables (A, B). The term MaxInfo*(Dataset,p,q) represents the maximum mutual information obtainable from the dataset for the given partitioning. The SampleSize denotes the total number of data points, with Func(SampleSize) being a function of this size, typically set to SampleSize0.6 [45]. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis using a dataset encompassing the edamame futures trading activities on the Dalian Commodity Exchange. The dataset is comprised of a total of 2750 entries. These entries were strategically segmented into different subsets for the purpose of the experiment: 2200 entries were allocated for the training set, while 275 entries each were designated for the verification and test sets, respectively. This distribution was meticulously planned to ensure a robust and thorough evaluation of the dataset. The data used in this study was sourced from the Tushare platform, an open-access repository for financial big data. Our analysis focused on key financial indices, including the U.S. Dollar Index (USDX) and NASDAQ. These indices were selected due to their established impact on market trends and economic indicators, providing important context for understanding the dynamics of the edamame futures market. The primary dataset comprised edamame futures trading activities on the Dalian Commodity Exchange, totaling 2,750 data entries. The choice to focus on edamame futures was driven by the significant economic impact and high market price volatility associated with this commodity. To ensure a robust and comprehensive evaluation, we employed a carefully designed data segmentation strategy: 2,200 entries were allocated to the training set, while 275 entries each were designated for the validation and test sets. This approach allows for a thorough assessment of the dataset and enhances the reliability of the experimental results. By incorporating these key financial indices as external influences and focusing on the edamame futures price data, our study aims to contextualize the analysis within a broader economic landscape. This approach enhances the accuracy and relevance of our findings, providing valuable insights into the complex dynamics of the edamame futures market. The adopted methodology for data standardization is encapsulated by the following mathematical representation: (12) In this equation, Vt signifies the interpolated value at time t, while Vt−1 and Vt−2 represent the recorded data from the immediate and second preceding trading days at time t, respectively. Subsequent to this interpolation, a comprehensive integration of the influencing factors and the edamame futures data is conducted. Given the substantial variance often present in the magnitudes of different features within the dataset, there is a potential risk of inadequate learning by the algorithm. This approach normalizes the data, scaling the features to a uniform range of [0, 1], thereby enhancing algorithmic learning efficiency. The experimental design, as depicted in Fig 8, incorporates a step size of 1 and a sequence length of 7. With a total data length of 2750, the data is restructured into a three-dimensional format, yielding a final dimension of (2744, 7, 12). This reconfiguration involves grouping the data into segments of seven rows and eight columns, starting from x − 6 data points. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.g008 The efficacy of neural networks in generalizing performance often surpasses that of linear models, attributed to their intricate parameter architecture. However, this complexity necessitates meticulous fine-tuning of numerous hyperparameters to achieve optimal generalization capabilities. In this experimental framework, an initial range for the optimal hyperparameters was established based on prior experiential knowledge. We conducted Bayesian optimization privately to search for optimal hyperparameters. However, we discovered that extreme hyperparameter optimization could lead to a reduction in the model’s generalization performance. While the chosen reasonable hyperparameter values based on experience may not yield the best results on our specific dataset, they help ensure that the models are less sensitive to parameter variations, promoting better generalization and ease of fine-tuning. Regarding the choice of 32 units in Table 3, this value was selected based on our prior experience and considering the trade-off between model complexity and computational efficiency. We acknowledge that exploring a wider range of unit values could potentially improve performance. However, our primary focus was on maintaining consistency across models to enable a fair comparison. We believe that the chosen hyperparameter values strike a balance between model performance and generalization ability. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.t003 In addition to the hyperparameter optimization techniques discussed earlier, we also incorporated early stopping criteria into our model training process to further enhance the model’s generalization ability and prevent overfitting. Early stopping is a widely used regularization technique in machine learning that involves monitoring the model’s performance on a validation set during training and stopping the training process when the performance on the validation set starts to degrade. To implement early stopping, we split our data into training, validation, and test sets. During the training process, we monitored the model’s performance on the validation set at each epoch. If the model’s performance on the validation set did not improve for a specified number of epochs (defined as the patience parameter), the training was stopped, and the model weights from the best-performing epoch were retained. This approach allowed us to determine the optimal value for the patience parameter that maximized the model’s performance on the validation set while preventing overfitting. The incorporation of early stopping criteria into our model training process not only improved the model’s performance but also provided a more rigorous and comprehensive analysis of our approach. By leveraging this technique, we ensured that our proposed CIMA-AttGRU model is robust, reliable, and capable of generalizing well to unseen data. The performance of these models was rigorously evaluated using metrics such as RMSE, MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and R2, seen in Fig 9. The results, detailed in Table 4, were derived using the test dataset. These results highlighted that the conventional regression model SVR exhibited the least predictive accuracy. Within the realm of deep learning models, AttGRU demonstrated superior performance over Attention-GRU, with CIMA-AttGRU emerging as the most effective predictive model. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.g009 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.t004 A comparative analysis, as evidenced in Table 4, reveals that the AttGRU model achieved a significant improvement in prediction accuracy compared to the standard GRU model. This improvement is quantified by a reduction in MAE by 7.47, a decrease in RMSE by 8.72. Similarly, when comparing the CIMA-enhanced models, CIMA-AttGRU outperformed CIMA-Attention-GRU, evidenced by a reduction in MAE by 7.41, a decrease in RMSE by 8.10. The comparative visualization of predicted versus actual values for GRU, Attention- GRU, Attention-NGU, AttGRU, CIMA-Attention-GRU, and CIMA-AttGRU models is provided in Fig 10. This graphical representation underscores the enhanced predictive capabilities of the CIMA-AttGRU model over its counterparts. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.g010 To assess the individual contributions of the CIMA and AttGRU components to the forecasting performance of the CIMA-AttGRU model, we designed a series of ablation experiments depicted in Fig 11. These experiments were structured to incrementally remove key components from the full model and evaluate the resulting impact on prediction accuracy. The experiments were conducted on a dataset comprising edamame futures prices, with the following configurations for model evaluation: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.g011 The outcomes of the ablation study are summarized in Table 4, highlighting the performance metrics across different model configurations. The ablation study reveals the critical role played by both CIMA and AttGRU in enhancing the forecasting performance of the model. While the base GRU model provides a baseline for comparison, the addition of CIMA preprocessing significantly reduces both MAE and RMSE, indicating the importance of noise reduction and signal decomposition in improving prediction accuracy. The incorporation of the attention mechanism via AttGRU layers further improves the model’s ability to capture temporal dependencies, as evidenced by the reduced error metrics. The full CIMA-AttGRU model, combining both CIMA preprocessing and AttGRU, achieves the best performance across all metrics. This underscores the synergy between CIMA’s ability to prepare the data through signal decomposition and the AttGRU’s capabiity to focus on relevant temporal features, leading to more accurate predictions of edamame futures prices. To rigorously evaluate the predictive performance of the CIMA-AttGRU model relative to other models, we employed the Diebold-Mariano (DM) test [46] to compare the statistical significance of differences in prediction accuracy. The DM test is a widely used non-parametric statistical test for comparing the forecast errors of two models. The null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference in the predictive accuracy of the two models. If the p-value is less than the significance level (e.g., 0.05), the null hypothesis can be rejected, indicating a significant difference in the models’ performance. We selected six main benchmark models (SVR, LSTM, GRU, Attention-LSTM, Attention-GRU, AttGRU, Attention-AttGRU, and CIMA-Attention-GRU) and conducted pairwise comparisons with the CIMA-AttGRU model. The test results are presented in Table 5. As shown, the CIMA-AttGRU model demonstrates statistically significant differences in predictive accuracy compared to all other models (p < 0.05). The absolute values of the DM statistics and the magnitude of the p-values are consistent with the performance metrics in Table 4, indicating that models with larger performance gaps have larger absolute DM statistics and smaller corresponding p-values. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313066.t005 The DM test results provide strong evidence supporting the superior performance of the CIMA-AttGRU model in the task of soybean futures price prediction. The integration of CIMA decomposition and attention mechanism enables the model to better capture the intrinsic patterns in the data and enhance the accuracy of predictions. These findings are consistent with the experimental results presented throughout the paper, reinforcing the effectiveness of the proposed model. The statistical significance tests add robustness to our claims about the CIMA-AttGRU model’s performance and strengthen the overall credibility of the research. By demonstrating the model’s statistically significant improvements over a range of benchmark models, we provide compelling evidence for its practical value in forecasting soybean futures prices. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the CIMA-AttGRU model in predicting soybean futures prices compared to other benchmark models. This can be attributed to its unique architecture, which combines CIMA for noise reduction and AttGRU for capturing dynamic temporal dependencies. CIMA enables the model to filter out market noise and decompose the time series data into intrinsic modes, addressing the high volatility in agricultural markets. This allows the model to focus on essential features and underlying patterns, leading to improved prediction accuracy. The AttGRU component, with its attention mechanism, dynamically adjusts to temporal dependencies, enabling the model to capture nuanced fluctuations in futures prices often overlooked by traditional models. The attention mechanism helps prioritize relevant information and adapt to changing market conditions. The incorporation of CADA enhances the model’s robustness by addressing domain adaptivity, which is crucial for soybean futures, where price determinants vary significantly over time and across regions. CADA aligns feature distributions between source and target domains, improving generalization ability and adaptability to new market conditions. The ablation study highlights the individual contributions of CIMA and AttGRU components to the overall performance, showing their crucial roles in improving prediction accuracy. While CIMA-AttGRU demonstrates significant improvements in prediction accuracy, its increased complexity may lead to longer training times and higher computational requirements. Future research could explore ways to optimize the model’s architecture and training process to improve efficiency without compromising predictive performance. In this study, we propose the CIMA-AttGRU model for predicting soybean futures prices. The model combines CIMA for noise reduction and AttGRU for capturing temporal dependencies, achieving superior performance compared to benchmark models. The experimental results, supported by statistical tests, demonstrate the effectiveness of CIMA-AttGRU in capturing the complex dynamics of the soybean futures market and providing accurate predictions. The model’s ability to filter out noise, focus on relevant features, and adapt to changing market conditions makes it valuable for stakeholders in the soybean industry. The proposed architecture can be adapted to other agricultural commodities and financial markets, where accurate forecasting is crucial. Future research directions include incorporating additional external factors and exploring the integration of CIMA-AttGRU with other machine learning techniques to improve its generalization ability and adaptability. In conclusion, CIMA-AttGRU represents a significant advancement in agricultural market forecasting, providing a powerful tool for predicting soybean futures prices. Its superior performance, robustness, and adaptability contribute to the growing body of research on the application of advanced machine learning techniques in the financial and agricultural sectors.

Among the most popular tech products of 2024, the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses have been the surprise hit. Amazon is offering the version with the classic black frames for $239 (20% off the $299 retail price). This is an especially excellent deal when you consider that many styles of the Meta Ray-Bans were often out of stock for much of the first half of 2024 -- and the smart glasses have rarely been discounted. A lot of the appeal is the fact that they look just like normal Ray-Bans, and you can even replace the lenses with your own glasses prescription. Also: The best Cyber Monday deals: Live updates The caveat to keep in mind here is that Amazon sells eight different styles of the Meta Ray-Bans, and it's the classic black frames with green tinted lenses that are on sale for the lowest price. Other styles cost $30 to $80 more. For example, if you want to wear these smart glasses both inside and outside, then you can get a pair with transition lenses. Those normally retail for $379, but Amazon is offering them 20% off, for $303. I tried the Meta Ray-Bans earlier this year and was much more impressed than I expected. First, to be clear, they are augmented reality glasses, but they're audio-only, so there's no screen overlaid on the lenses. All the feedback comes through the speakers that down-fire into your ears and are hidden in the arms of the glasses. Also: Why Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses are my favorite tech purchase this year I was also pleasantly surprised by the audio quality. For phone calls and conference calls and for listening to podcasts and audiobooks, the sound is nearly as bright and clear as a pair of AirPods or other quality earbuds. For listening to music, movies, or shows with lots of bass and surround sound effects, the Meta Ray-Bans are acceptable but not nearly as robust as a pair of high-end headphones from Apple, Sony, Bose, and others. And because of the open concept, naturally the Meta Ray-Bans can't offer the kind of noise cancellation that you get from AirPods Pro or the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds, for example. All in all, the sound of the Meta Ray-Bans is similar to what you get from the AirPods Pro in transparency mode. But, the Meta Ray-Bans can also do things that no headphones can do. They have a built-in 12-megapixel ultrawide camera for taking photos and capturing videos. This camera is about the same quality as an iPhone 12 or a Samsung Galaxy S20. It only takes photos and videos in portrait mode, but it's far faster to tap the button on top of the right arm of the glasses than it is to pull your camera out of your pocket. The Meta Ray-Bans also have a built-in AI assistant that you can trigger by saying "Hey Meta," and use the large language models that Meta has been furiously building over the past several years. For basic information searches, it works well and is another nice option for leaving your phone in your pocket. The battery life is about a half-day with moderate use, but you can quickly charge to about 50% with 20 minutes in the included case. The case itself charges via standard USB-C, which is nice. You can nearly double the battery by turning off the "Hey Meta" listening feature -- which I did. Meta also regularly rolls out software updates that bring new functionality to the Meta Ray-Bans. For example, during 2024 the Meta Ray-Bans added the capability of translating from Spanish to English in real time and the ability to do a visual search to identify landmarks or translate street signs. And Meta says it will continue to add new features such as helping you remember things you've seen, like your parking spot. Also: The best Apple deals for Cyber Monday 2024 If you're concerned about the way Meta handles privacy -- as many of us are -- the good thing about the Meta Ray-Bans is that they don't require a Facebook account. While they do require a Meta account, you can at least ostensibly keep them separate from your Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp data. That makes it easier for me to recommend the product from a privacy perspective. Don't get me wrong, the AirPods Pro 2 are available for a great deal at $153 ($97 off) for Black Friday and Cyber Monday. But the Meta Ray-Bans can do nearly all that the AirPods Pro can do and more. And since smart glasses are getting more and more common and the promise of smarter AI-powered features are on the horizon, getting a pair of Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses gives you a better chance of getting a taste of the future.

Title: Cyber Monday Meta Quest 3 deals: Save $174 on new 3S bundle with this coupon

When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more If you've waited this long to pick up one of the best Meta Quest Cyber Monday deals, then give yourself a quick pat on the back, then get yourself to the checkout with the bundle before it sells out again. The affordable VR headsets have been one of the most popular items in our roundup of best Cyber Monday deals and this is the last day for many promotions - we've some expire this morning. This best one still available is a Meta Quest 3S bundle that includes a free download code for the new Batman: Arkham Shadow game and a three-month subscription to Meta Quest+ to play a fresh rotating catalog of games. All this for $299 on the 128GB model at Amazon. That's a $74 saving today. Earlier, there were a couple of coupons (QUEST75 and QUEST100) on this deal for free Amazon credit, but that offer seems to have expired. Even so, it's worth trying them during the checkout process, just in case they get switched back on. Above bundles also come with three months of Meta Quest+. It's too soon to get a discount on the new Meta Quest 3S hardware, but the discounts on bundled extras are excellent today. All purchases currently come with a free download of the new Batman: Arkham Shadow VR game - which is lauded as one of the best titles you can play on the new headset. You'll certainly want to get it free, as buying the game separately costs $50. When the older Quest 3 launched last year, it came with Asura'a Wrath 2 for free for a while, and that game still costs $60 if bought separately, so don't sleep on this on these Meta Quest 3S bundles. The Quest 3S is Meta's most affordable VR headset. It has the same chipset and gaming performance as the pricier Quest 3, but its display isn't as sharp. This is an excellent fit for casual users who want a more budget-friendly entry into the world of VR. This is a great time to buy, as you'll get a free download of the Batman: Arkham Shadow game (worth $50) and three months of Meta Quest+ (worth $24). Highlights Specifics The larger 256GB model of the new Quest 3S is for the more dedicated VR fan keen on downloading and storing a larger number of games and apps at once. VR newcomers would be better off saving some cash with the 128GB model in our book, though. Otherwise, you're getting the same excellent value headset, and all purchases currently include a code for the super-fun Batman: Arkham Shadow game (a $50 value). You're also getting three months of Meta Quest+ (worth $24). The full-sized Meta Quest 3 is an odd duck right now. It's only a year old and still an excellent piece of hardware with a slightly better resolution than the new 3S, but it costs $200 more. Granted, you're getting a more advanced piece of kit (not by much, though, in all honesty) and a much larger storage capacity at 512GB instead of the 128GB/256GB options the 3S comes in. Meta has kept up production, though, and like the Quest 3S, you can get a free code for Batman: Arkham Shadow with purchases, which adds another $50 value to the deal below. We'll keep our eyes peeled for further discounts for the rest of the Cyber Monday sales. The slightly older Meta Quest 3 VR headset builds on its predecessor with mixed reality capabilities, 4K resolution, an upgraded processor that offers double the speed, and new ergonomics for the head unit and controllers. Like the newer 3S model it also comes with a free download code for the new Batman: Arkham Shadow VR game (worth $50). The larger 512GB version is the only one remaining, as the smaller ones have now been discontinued. Highlights Specifics The Meta Quest 2 (formerly known as the Oculus Quest 2) has officially been discontinued, and we haven't seen any new units in stock for quite some time. Plenty of refurbished ones are knocking around, but most are more expensive than the new Quest 3S, which is a poor value today, given the Quest 3S is a more advanced VR headset than the Quest 2. As such, we won't highlight deals for the Quest 2 unless they're ridiculously cheap - say $100-$150. And even then, they'll be refurbs/preowned. Nothing of note showed up on Black Friday, so we'd assume the same for the remaining time of Cyber Monday sales. Cyber Monday lands on December 2. While we often see a few deals hang on for a few extra days, the really strong hardware ones usually snap shut right at the end of Cyber Monday itself. We'd go off midnight PT as a rule of thumb, but waiting that long is a luxury you shouldn't indulge with the best bundles, especially that mad Amazon. Both are already involved, yes. The main Quest 3 is over a year old, so it is in a great position to be discounted - and it needs one, to be honest, given the 3S is much cheaper and the best option for most buyers. So far, it's just bundled freebies instead of a discount. That being said, Meta discontinued the 128GB one and made the 512GB one the only option, but lowered the price of it to the 128's old price at $499. So you're already getting a better deal than last year. However, we still think you should be eyeing up the Cyber Monday Quest 3S deals above instead. The Meta Quest 3S was only released in October this year, but even so, it's come up with the best bundle options so far, with free extras worth up to $174 on the 128GB model.

Cyber Monday 2024 Cyber Monday Deals Cyber Monday Tech Deals Best Buy Deals Cyber Monday Apple Deals Cyber Monday Laptop Deals Cyber Monday Toy Deals Cyber Monday Coffee Deals Cyber Monday Mattress Deals Cyber Monday Outdoor Deals Cyber Monday TV Deals Cyber Monday Camera Deals Branch Cyber Monday Deals If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED Cyber Monday may be over, but the deals are still going strong—for now. Whether you're checking off your holiday shopping or snagging a special treat for yourself, now's the time to pounce. Every item on this list has been vetted, tested, and loved by someone at WIRED. Our Gear team has cross-checked these picks with our buying guides to ensure you're getting the lowest prices—or close to it. Don't wait too long, though. These prices won't stick around forever—some may already expire by the time you reach the end of this story. Jump to Category Our Process We test products year-round and handpicked these deals. To find you the best deals, we use a proprietary tool that scans prices on everything we've reviewed over the last two years and spotlights notable price changes. We then pore over massive spreadsheets by hand and pick the best of the best deals. Samsung's S90D (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the best TVs you can buy right now, offering vivid yet naturalistic colors, class-leading brightness, and near-infinite contrast and perfect black levels that make OLED TVs so gobsmacking to gaze at. Outside its stellar performance, you’ll get a loaded suite of gaming features, including four HDMI 2.1 inputs for advanced gameplay, a dedicated game bar, and Samsung's Game Hub to stream from services like Xbox Game Pass. The one notable drawback for all Samsung TVs is their lack of Dolby Vision HDR, which is more prevalent than Samsung’s dynamic alternative, HDR10+. Even so, I’d happily have this stylish beauty as my primary display, offering picture quality that’s among the best I’ve seen all year at its best price yet. —Ryan Waniata Sony’s Bravia 9 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best-performing backlit TV around. It blends next-gen brightness with Sony’s proprietary dimming and picture processing to provide stunningly balanced performance across the board. The TV’s brightness pushes toward the psychedelic when called upon, but with measured dispersal to keep from blowing your eyeballs out. On the other end, you’ll experience OLED-like black levels and contrast, and 4K detail that pops off the screen. Sony only offers two HDMI 2.1 ports, meaning you’re losing two slots for gaming consoles over competitors, and the TV’s off-axis viewing is good, not great. That’s the price you’ll pay for brilliance that outdoes even the most fiery OLED displays. If you’ve been looking for a good sale on the best LED TV out there, your search is over. —Ryan Waniata The price of Sony’s impressive Bravia 7 TV (7/10, WIRED Recommends) has sunk like a stone. I took points off the score for its poor off-axis performance, but if you’re watching mostly from straight on, this TV rocks. You’ll get stunning clarity and detail, excellent brightness, vibrant quantum dot colors, and deep black levels thanks to the same algorithm that helps Sony’s Bravia 9 TV look so good. Like all of Sony’s premium TVs, the Bravia 7 offers only two HDMI 2.1 ports, limiting your options for high-performance gaming when compared to some of the best TVs in its class. Otherwise, this is a sweet screen for hundreds less than its inflated launch price. —Ryan Waniata Hisense's 65-inch U7N QLED TV (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our choice as the best TV for most people right now, thanks to its impressive performance and features for the money. The TV’s swarm of mini LED backlights serve up fiery brightness and deep black levels with minimal light bleed, meaning the picture looks great in the daylight and the dark. It’s got great gaming features, including VRR (variable refresh rate) for gaming at up to 144 kHz from its high-refresh panel, and an intuitive Google TV smart system to run the show. Videophiles will likely notice some dirty screen effect—this is a value model after all—and like nearly all backlit TVs, its off-axis viewing is just OK. Still, there’s little to complain about in this well-balanced package, serving up big 4K thrills at a crazy-low price. —Ryan Waniata If you’re after a solid screen at a sweet price, Roku’s baseline Plus Series could be right up your alley. It all starts with the fantastic Roku operating system that makes it remarkably simple to call up connected devices, grab any app, and even track down your remote with a built-in chime. Frankly, that last feature is so fundamental I can’t believe it isn’t standard in all modern TVs. The Plus Series’ panel only offers a 60-Hz refresh rate, so it’s not the best option for serious gamers, but it’s a solid performer thanks to good brightness and punchy colors. Thanks to local dimming, you won’t see blotchy patches when the lights are down, either. Support for Apple Homekit, Alexa, and Google Assistant rounds out the package for a great budget buy. —Ryan Waniata For those looking to see the blaze of summer in the dead of winter, Hisense’s 65-inch U8N TV serves up stunning brightness that nearly doubles many TVs in its price class. All that power doesn’t come at the cost of contrast, as the TV provides excellent black levels with minimal light bleed, alongside vivid quantum dot colors to let you bask in its sizzling punch in any lighting. You’ll also get the latest gaming features, a breezy Google TV interface, and every major flavor of HDR. The off-axis viewing isn’t anything to write home about, but this TV feels more premium than it has a right to for under $1,000. Looking to go bigger? The 75-inch version is still reasonable at $1,300, or you can go nuclear with the 85-incher for $300 more. —Ryan Waniata Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Apple’s latest iPad Mini (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with several internal upgrades. With an A17 Pro chip, it can handle both graphically demanding games and Apple Intelligence (the company’s suite of artificial intelligence features) with ease. It also has support for the feature-packed Apple Pencil Pro. All of this is packed into a tiny build that’s great for traveling with—whether you’re using it for gaming or reading ebooks. —Brenda Stolyar This is the latest Apple Pencil to join the lineup. Unlike the 1st and 2nd-gen versions, it comes with a “squeeze” capability that triggers the tool palette (you can use double-tap as well) and a haptic engine that delivers feedback when you squeeze the stylus. The built-in gyroscope sensor also allows you to change the orientation of each tool as you twist it, giving you finer control. It’s only compatible with the iPad Air (M2), iPad Pro (M4), and iPad Mini (A17 Pro). —Brenda Stolyar The iMac with M4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with a few notable upgrades, including a 12-megapixel webcam with support for Center Stage, the option to add a nano-texture display, and the accessories now come with USB-C ports. Powered by the latest M4 chip, it delivers great performance too. It’s currently our favorite desktop in our guide to Best All-in-One Computers. —Brenda Stolyar This MacBook Air (9/10, WIRED Recommends) with M1 is the cheapest MacBook you can buy. Although the M1 came out back in 2020, it’s still a speedy and capable chip for simple tasks and basic activities (like web browsing, sending emails, and word processing) along with light video editing. It also has solid battery life and will easily last you an entire day. It’s a good option if you’re looking for a reliable MacBook without breaking the bank. —Brenda Stolyar Apple recently launched the M4-powered versions of the MacBook Pro, but the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) remains a great option. It has a bright display with mini-LED and a 1080p webcam built in. You’ll also get a 120-Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling. As usual, it packs plenty of ports, including two USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 4, an HDMI, a MagSafe charging port, an SD card slot, and a high-impedance headphone jack. We recommend it if you don’t want to spend over $2,000 on a MacBook Pro. —Brenda Stolyar This is one of our top picks in our guide to Best MacBook Accessories. The low-profile keys are satisfying to type on, while the slim and lightweight build is easy to travel with for those who like to take their peripherals on the go. It mimics the MacBook keyboard too, complete with a Do Not Disturb key and the option to program the function row key with Apple’s own apps like Keynote, Final Cut Pro, Safari, and more. It’s only available with tactile quiet switches, though. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite keyboard case for iPads. The first half protects the back of the iPad and also comes with a kickstand while the second half has a detachable keyboard and trackpad. The case is not only durable and sturdy but also feels great to type on. Instead of Bluetooth, it connects using Apple’s Smart Connector so you don’t have to worry about draining battery life. It’s available for the base iPad (7th, 8th, and 9th Gen) along with the iPad Air (5th Gen and M2) and 11-inch iPad Pro (1st Gen and newer), 12.9-inch iPad Pro (5th and 6th Gen), as well as the 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro with M4. —Brenda Stolyar Logitech's Casa Pop-Up Desk (9/10, WIRED Review) is a great solution for those who constantly work on the go but prefer using an external keyboard and mouse with your laptop. Instead of carrying all those accessories around, the Casa Pop-Up Desk includes a keyboard and trackpad that fit neatly into a compact case that doubles as a laptop stand. It’s expensive, but it’s worth it if you’re always working out of the house. —Brenda Stolyar This is a great accessory if you want to use your iPhone as a webcam. Thanks to a feature called Continuity Camera, you can use your iPhone as a webcam for a MacBook (you can check out these instructions for how to set it up). The circular silicone puck magnetically connects to your iPhone (it also doubles as a kickstand or phone grip), and there’s a section that pops out so you can mount the iPhone on top of a MacBook. Since it utilizes the rear camera, the Belkin allows for a more natural video-calling experience and better image quality than the standard MacBook webcam. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This Bluetooth-connected portable board finally got my 7- and 9-year-old interested in chess. The pieces feel wonderfully matte and heavy to play with. It connects to the GoChess app on your phone, which is integrated with Lichess and Chess.com. You can play against other people or get AI-enabled suggestions in person, and the board lights up to guide you. My kids will pick up pieces and discuss moves for hours. It's great.—Adrienne So A firm WIRED favorite and one of the best family board games, Ticket to Ride features steam engine styling and rules that are easy to grasp. All you must do is claim railway routes across the US and Canada using your colorful plastic rail cars. Spend cards to claim routes, rack up bonus points for connecting specific destinations, and the person with the highest score at the end wins. All aboard, choo, choo! —Simon Hill If your kid is learning how to ride a bike, a Guardian bike is not that much more expensive than a big box store bike, and it weighs around 10 pounds less. Guardian's proprietary SureStop brake system which means the rear wheel will always brake before the front wheel, so your kid will never flip over. It works. I gave my kid's bike to a 20-year-old ding-dong to test in an empty parking garage, and he couldn't flip it.—Adrienne So Inspired by the Royal Palace of Evora in Portugal, with its Moorish blue-and-white ceramic tiles, this board game challenges you to make mosaics by matching tiles with different patterns and colors to amass the maximum possible score. One of the best family board games for all tastes, Azul is easy to grasp but supports many tactical approaches and has surprising depth. The beautiful tiles and other components are high quality, and filling your board is deeply satisfying. Play moves quickly, and you can complete a game in less than an hour, but you will probably want to play again immediately. —Simon Hill Start with a randomly generated map of hexagonal tiles in this addictive family board game, and gather and trade resources to develop your civilization and win. Amassing enough victory points requires a smart strategy and some dice-rolling luck. Catan is easy to get the hang of and only takes around an hour to finish. Players can trade freely, but the robber mechanic can cause arguments, so set some ground rules. The modular randomization makes for excellent replay value, and there are expansions and spin-offs to further complicate the gameplay. This game is for three or four players aged 10 years and up. —Simon Hill This cat-themed card game is easy to pick up and perfect for a quick game. The aim is to avoid exploding kitten cards by wielding a comical cast of cats with special powers. Timing and strategy are essential to get the best of your opponents. This fun card game appears in our best family board games guide. If it’s a hit with your fam, there are countless expansion packs worth trying. —Simon Hill One of the best family board games for larger groups, Herd Mentality is all about writing down the same answer as everyone else. If you agree with the majority of players on the best pizza topping, Disney movie, or the smallest animal that could carry your weight, you win a cow token. Eight tokens win you the game, but if you are the odd one out, you get the pink cow of doom. It’s funny and easy to play with any group. —Simon Hill I’m going to be honest with you: I hate these blinky, twinkly, one-trick-pony toys because my kids play with them for a week or two and then put them away forever. (Give them sets or skills they can build on, like games, Lego, or instruments.) Nevertheless, I make an exception because Sphero’s toys are so delightful and this price is ridiculous. My colleague Simon Hill’s wife uses this coding ball as a classroom aid to teach basic coding skills to 9-year-olds and older. It’s adorable and can move and navigate mazes through infrared communication. —Adrienne So Loog Guitars is holding a sitewide sale for 40 percent off that ends tonight. This is cheating a bit, because my kids already know how to play piano and violin, but the Loog electric guitar is the fastest I've ever seen them pick up an instrument. The app is fun and engaging and my son even tuned it himself. (It's also an excuse to get on the iPad, grrr.) —Adrienne So This rock tumbler is perfect for any aspiring rock hound, and we say as much in our STEM toys buying guide. The kit includes four levels of grit, plus a bag of rough gemstones so they can get started tumbling during Christmas break. According to the Amazon reviews, this tumbler is also used and liked by some adults who've been putting rocks in their pockets for decades. —Adrienne So This stylish Lego set is from the botanicals collection, and can be loved by Lego fans and interior design fans alike. It’s a fun set to build with a person, too, since it’s built in two near-identical halves that you and someone else can make at the same time and then connect together. The finished piece has lived everywhere from my entryway to my dining room table to various shelves, and it’s looked good in every single spot. —Nena Farrell Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals If you use Samsung devices, this is a great triple wireless charger for your Galaxy phone, Galaxy smartwatch, and Galaxy earbuds. Since it’s Qi-compatible, you can also use it to charge other devices as well—including iPhones. It also has LEDs that light up quickly when you place your gadgets down on it, and it also comes with a 25-watt wall charger and USB-C cable. However, it doesn’t work with all Galaxy watches. We found that it was, however, compatible with the Watch4 and older Watch3. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite MagSafe dash mount for the iPhone 12 or later. You can attach it via dashboard pad or windshield with a suction cup—both of which proved secure in our testing. There’s also a telescopic arm that combines with a ball joint for a wide range of movement, allowing you to find the ideal position. The USB-C charging cable is removable too, so you can store it when it’s not in use. There’s also a built-in fan to help keep you cool when it gets hot outside. Our only gripe is that it tops out at 7.5 watts for charging. —Brenda Stolyar Durable and versatile, this power bank slips easily into a bag and has a nice grippy, textured finish. The yellow is easy to spot in a crowded tent, and the segmented LED shows the remaining power in blocks of 10 percent. The Charge 100 Max can charge up to five gadgets at once, and the wireless charging pad on top is handy in the dark when you don’t want to fumble with cables. This is the outdoors pick in our Best Portable Chargers guide. —Simon Hill We particularly love Belkin’s BoostCharge Pro for its compact design and support for 15-watt wireless charging. The prongs also cling to your vent securely and the array of magnets allow for a strong hold with MagSafe-enabled iPhones. With a ball joint, you can also angle your phone slightly for a better view of the screen. Unfortunately, the USB-C cable is permanently attached. —Brenda Stolyar This is our top 3-in-1 wireless charger if you want to utilize Apple’s StandBy Mode. Introduced with iOS 17, it turns your iPhone into a smart display. With Twelve South’s charger, you can place it in landscape mode to trigger the feature while also simultaneously charging two other devices on the base such as your Apple Watch or AirPods. —Brenda Stolyar Belkin’s Stand Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with DockKit integration, which means it can use the iPhone’s camera to track your face while the 360-degree base automatically moves around to keep you in frame. It’s great for those who FaceTime a lot and find themselves searching for objects to prop the phone on. It’s also an excellent accessory for content creators who want to record hands-free video on the go. With a built-in battery, you don’t need to worry about being near a power source either. But with support for MagSafe, you can also use it as a charger. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The best air fryers help you cook quickly and potentially with less fat or oil. These compact convection ovens heat up fast to make crispy chicken, fries, and donuts. This Cosori model is our favorite smart air fryer because you can remotely control it using a smartphone or tablet (it also has a digital control panel). We like the slick, black, classy design. The cooking drawer has a smooth action, and the handle stays cool, though the sides can get hot, so it needs plenty of space. Temperature options range from 175 degrees Fahrenheit to a powerful 400, with 12 handy preset cooking modes. —Simon Hill The Typhur dome air fryer cooks with blazing speed and has a modern round shape that I enjoyed in my testing. It’s easy to clean and has intuitive controls. —Martin Cizmar I love Cync's smart light bulbs, but the lights I use most by Cync are now the Undercabinet Pick Lights. They're easy to install under your cabinets, and easy to control over the app or a smart speaker. These undercabinet lights can do a variety of shades of whites, colors, and even fun effects that Cync calls Light Shows (my favorite is the candle option for moody fall lighting). They're usually $85, so getting three pucks to put under your kitchen cabinets is a nice discount. I used four pucks for four cabinets, two on either side of my cabinets around my oven, so I recommend at least two packs if you have cabinets split up by an oven. —Nena Farrell The Nutribullet Ultra is one of the best blenders we’ve tested. It’s stylish and has simple controls, and the 1,200-watt motor is powerful enough to handle all your smoothies, dips, and sauces. The 30-second blend is usually enough to get through your ingredients, but you might have to run a second cycle if you want the smoothest consistencies. The five-year warranty and suction cup feet are icing on the cake. Er, smoothie. We’ve seen this blender drop to $90 before, but anything below $110 is a good deal. —Louryn Strampe If you don't want to spring for the Thermapen above, the ThermoPop is a great budget option. It's not as fast, but it's still fast and the large, back-lit, auto-rotating screen is easy to read. It's waterproof, and accurate to plus or minus one degree. —Scott Gilbertson Instant-read thermometers are a kitchen essential. Can you prod your steak with a finger and accurately temp it? I think not. The Thermapen One will tell you the exact internal temperature in one second; no need for elaborate guesswork. Cheap instant-read thermometers litter Amazon, but we like the more expensive Thermapen One for its reliability and speed. The speed is important because the longer that oven door is open, the more unevenly you end up cooking. At this price, why not get the best? —Scott Gilbertson For those who want an air fryer but don’t want to devote the hefty counter space to a full-sized device, the WIRED Gear team’s favorite compact model is this nifty little Ninja, which is clocking in at a hefty discount. The cooker is still quite versatile for a wee thing, with settings that include max crisp, air fry, air roast, air broil, bake, reheat, and dehydrate. Our tester even managed to successfully bake a little chocolate cake. —Matthew Korfhage If you’ve been meaning to cut down on single-use plastics, now’s your chance. We love Stasher’s silicone bags, which are reusable and versatile, whether you’re meal prepping, storing leftovers, or cooking sous vide (7/10, WIRED Recommends). They’re dishwasher and microwave-safe, leakproof, and designed to last through thousands of uses. At $9, it’s a small price to pay for a sustainable swap you’ll use daily. —Boutayna Chokrane This excellent blender is durable and powerful. It’s got a generous 8-cup capacity and 10 blend settings. It gets pretty loud on the fastest setting, but our tester’s hummus was smooth in 30 seconds. The Braun has a touchscreen with several preset modes for things like smoothies, soups, spreads, frozen desserts, and more. The jar is made of Tritan, a type of impact-resistant plastic, rather than glass, but if that doesn’t bother you, this is a good deal on a reliable model. —Louryn Strampe We’ve tested a lot of food processors, and this model from KitchenAid is the very best we’ve tried. It comes in four colors and has a solid 9-cup capacity which has enough room to make servings for a family of four. The blades and discs can be stored in the bowl and the base has storage for the cord. You’ll get a multipurpose blade, a dough blade, a slicing disc, a julienne disc, and a whisk accessory. This deal matches the best price we’ve tracked. —Louryn Strampe The Enso is the WIRED Gear team’s favorite overall soda maker: durable, simple, sturdy, easy to use, and so intuitive you can make soda with one hand while skimming the news with your phone. If you use the HOLIDAY40 code on SodaStream’s website, it’s 40 percent off. —Matthew Korfhage This egg cooker fluctuates in price all the time, but this is one of the lowest prices we’ve seen it. It’s featured in our “Buy It for Life” guide. WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu says his wife loves this little countertop appliance, which can cook eggs in a myriad of different ways. Poach, soft-boil, hard-boil, or even whip up an omelet. It’ll chime to let you know when breakfast is served. It’s available in several cute colors like aqua, powder blue, and red. —Louryn Strampe How is a coffee warmer smart? Hint: It’s not because it uploads your habits to a cloud server. It’s smart because it turns itself on when you put a flat-bottomed coffee mug on top of it, and keeps your coffee warm at about 130 degrees. And it turns itself off when you remove the mug. So your coffee stays warm, and you don’t have to think about it. It makes for a great gift to anyone who likes, you know, warm beverages. —Matthew Korfhage Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals There has never been a better time to buy a robot vacuum. Even as the technology advances by leaps and bounds, many older models remain perfectly capable—and sometimes more than grand cheaper. The Q5 Pro+ has now been supplanted by Roborock’s Qrevo line, but this was our top pick for over a year and Roborock vacuums age well. I have a 6-year-old Roborock on the upper story of my house that is still going strong. —Adrienne So Dyson's V12 Detect Slim (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite Dyson vacuum if you have a small space, like a studio apartment or one-bedroom. It’s compact and lightweight, weighing only five pounds and just four feet long, and it’s perfect for both stashing in a small space and for vacuuming just a room or two since it has a run time of up to 60 minutes. It also comes with a variety of attachments. All and all, it’s pretty powerful for such a compact size. —Nena Farrell The Gen5Detect is one of the latest vacuums in Dyson’s lineup. The company swapped the trigger for a single power button and the Laser Slim Fluffy cleaner head now shoots out a laser that’s twice as bright. It packs the fastest motor yet, too, spinning at 135,000 revolutions per minute (RPM) with a suction power of 265 air watts (AW). Dyson added a HEPA filter as well, which Dyson says traps 99.99 percent of particles down to 0.1 microns. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite budget vacuum in our guide to Best Dyson Vacuums. A couple of years ago, the company updated the Motorbar Cleaner with its hair-detangling technology and hair screw tool. It has improved filtration too, with the ability to trap 99.99 percent of fine dust. This vacuum also converts into a hand vac, so you don’t have to buy a separate one. The battery should also last up to 40 minutes and takes about 5.5 hours to fully charge. If you're purchasing the vacuum from Kohl's, it's worth noting the sale ends at midnight. —Brenda Stolyar This is our top pick in our guide to Best Dyson Vacuums. It’s lightweight (at under 7 pounds), so it’s super easy to maneuver. My favorite feature is the green laser that shoots out of the front of the motorized head to help illuminate microscopic dust particles. There’s also a sensor built into the vacuum that counts the number and size of dust particles it’s sucking up. You can see the data on the LCD in real time. As for battery life, you’ll get a 60-minute run time while the battery itself takes up to 4.5 hours to charge. It’s pricey, but the features and performance are worth it. —Brenda Stolyar If you’re not interested in one of Dyson’s standard vacuums, you can opt for a robot vacuum instead. With a spin speed of 110,000 RPM, this one is super powerful. It also has a digital display and a filter that’s easy to remove and clean. According to Dyson, it also has six times more suction than the competition. It also comes equipped with a “triple-action” brush bar, which includes soft nylon for large debris on hard floors, antistatic carbon-fiber filaments for fine dust, and stiff nylon bristles for carpet. —Brenda Stolyar Top of our best carpet cleaners guide, this vacuum did an excellent job removing cat hair and lingering odors. It’s easy to use, comes with two removable tanks, and has a special spray jet to target stains. Fill the top tank to the marked lines with warm water and detergent, pull a trigger on the handle to wet wash, and then run over the area slowly and watch the bottom tank fill with dirty water. You can choose from three modes (Max, Deep, and Express), and it comes with multiple attachments, including one for upholstery and another for stairs. —Simon Hill Shark’s AI Ultra 2-in-1 mopping vacuum earned a “Most Improved Award” from me in 2022; the company recently replaced it with the Matrix. Shark’s products can be hit or miss, but happily I liked the Matrix very much. It has multifunctional vacuuming and mopping and is pretty reliable. It doesn’t need replacement dust bags—which is both a blessing and a curse, as the self-emptying dustbin sometimes doesn’t empty quite all the way. —Adrienne So The PetSafe ScoopFree SmartSpin Self-Cleaning Litter Box is around half the price of other popular (and expensive) automatic litter box models, and has a similar design. This futuristic-looking pod on legs has a weight detector that sets off the cleaning cycle a few minutes after your cat has gone to the bathroom, and has a slide-out tray in the bottom. It’s also connected to an app so that you review your cat’s toilet visits, where each entry displays the time they went, their weight, and trip duration. This box works surprisingly well and is a cheap alternative if you really hate taking out the litter but don’t want to shell out the big bucks. —Molly Higgins Like all of the Petlibro products I tested for my Automatic Pet Feeder guide, the One RFID Smart Feeder is a super-techy and sleek cat product. For this feeder, the pet wears a collar with a tag in which the feeder’s lid opens and retracts over the kibble when the cat approaches or leaves, ensuring that only the chosen pet with the collar can access the food. In my review, I called this “a nearly perfect device for a particular kind of pet owner.” I think this feeder would work best for a cat in a dog home, if one particular cat has special dietary needs, or if you have a multi-cat home with an aggressive eater. At only a little over 100 bucks, this would be a good time to snag and see if this product would work well for your pet. —Molly Higgins Petlibro’s Polar Wet Food Feeder is a smart little invention and first of its kind in the Automatic Pet Feeder realm—it’s basically a minifridge that operates via the app to deliver wet food that can be safely stored for up to 3 days. You can customize feeding schedules via the app and the Polar even shuts off cooling 30 minutes before feeding to make sure the food is not too cold if your cat is as picky as mine. I already have one at home, but at a great value for less than a hundred bucks right now ($80), I’m ordering a second one for my other cat. Gone are the days of them screeching for a can of wet food at 5 am. —Molly Higgins The best smart Christmas lights you can buy are on sale. Perfect timing if you need to upgrade. Easy to set up, with a black or green cord that blends nicely into the tree, Twinly’s lights support all kinds of colors and animated effects via the app, and you can also make custom effects. You can design based on an existing pattern, draw with your fingers, or even upload a GIF. Draped on a tree, the lights are best with gradient and stripe-style patterns, like the candy cane stripe effect. —Simon Hill One of the cheapest and best Govee smart lights you can buy is this affordable light strip that comes in several lengths. It is designed to be hidden behind furniture, so you just see the reflected light. We are highlighting the longest 100-foot option here, but all are segmented to display multiple colors, can be controlled wirelessly from the app or using voice controls, and support Govee’s enormous variety of lighting effects. These light strips also appear in our best smart lighting guide. —Simon Hill Nanoleaf makes fantastic wall light panels that double as light and home decor. The brand is famous for the hexagon sets, but Nanoleaf has expanded into other shapes, including triangles and light strips and even ceiling panels, in the past several years. This seven-pack of Nanoleaf Shapes Triangles is a fun size to use around the TV, in your office, or on any wall that could use a little fun added to it. It's a solid sale price, too, making it a good time to buy. —Nena Farrell If you’re looking for a great sunrise alarm clock for the price, you can’t do better than the Philips SmartSleep Wake-Up Light, especially now that it’s on sale. It’s a great little lamp that gets plenty bright to help you rise, and is easy to use and set up, too. It doesn’t have any nighttime routine options, but if you aren’t worried about those, this is a great purchase. —Nena Farrell If you're interested in light panels for your walls but want ones that will look just as nice when they're off as when they're turned on, Nanoleaf's Elements are a great choice. They’re our pick in the Best Nanoleaf Smart Lights for infrequent use since they have a wood finish, so you'll gain a more natural style statement when they’re turned off. These lights only glow in shades of white, so you’ll lose out on the rainbow aspect. Still, it's a nice trade-off, and you can get these on sale for almost $100 off right now. —Nena Farrell I'm not surprised this frame is on sale—Skylight just launched a new version earlier this fall, and it's fantastic, allowing you to switch out the frame style at will. This original model is still a solid digital photo frame, and it’s the best sale price you’ll find right now on digital photo frames. —Nena Farrell OK, we know you know about Ember’s temperature-controlled mugs, but Ohom’s is a whole different—and much simpler—beast. It’s not overengineered; you don’t have to connect it to your phone, check an app, and get constant phone pings. Instead, it looks and feels exactly like your favorite ceramic mug and the set keeps your coffee at the temperature you want to drink. That’s it! The heating pad also works as a charging pad! Just don’t put the mug in the microwave (which you shouldn’t anyway, because that makes coffee taste gross) and you’re good to go. —Adrienne So I’ve had this boxy model in my kitchen for over two years now to mitigate some of the combustion particulates from my gas stove, and this is one of the best sales for it I’ve seen. I especially appreciate that its HEPA replacement filters are both easy to find and inexpensive (Amazon has them for $26 for two). WIRED contributor Lisa Wood Shapiro also notes in our guide to the Best Air Purifiers that it has an excellent air exchange rate for small rooms, cleaning the air in 361 square feet at the recommended rate of 4.8 times per hour. —Kat Merck The Airmega 250 from clean air leader Coway provides the industrial vibe your home or loft needs. The warm gray box looks like a high-end speaker. And the Airmega 250 can do four air exchanges an hour when fitted for a 465-square-foot room. Utilizing a HEPA filter, this CARB-certified air purifier also has a washable prefilter along with an activated carbon filter to capture odors and VOCs. It has a built-in air quality sensor with indicator light and an easy-to-use control panel. It’s not app-compatible but does have a three-year warranty and runs at a relatively quiet 22 decibels. —Lisa Wood Shapir It takes a special screwdriver to deal with the soft, tiny, often infuriating screws that manufacturers love to use on anything from laptops to eyeglasses to remote controls–and these tiny screws often gatekeep simple repairs. Our Gear team’s testers haven’t been too impressed with multi-tools for screwdrivers this small. Get a good, tiny set like this Wiha 7-in-1 instead. —Matthew Korfhage The “super plush” name is true to the core. This super-soft robe is what I grab after every shower—my towel just has hair duty these days. It's a cozy robe that can dry you off while you're doing your hair, and it dries nicely for my next shower. If I were shopping for a new one, I'd jump for one of the cute striped options. Brooklinen often runs sales, but 25 percent off this robe is better than you'll usually find. —Nena Farrell This Arlo model has everything you need in an indoor security camera, including crisp 2K video at 24 frames per second, two-way audio, and a compact design that includes a privacy shutter. You can expect a quick loading feed in the Arlo app, useful smart notifications, and two-factor authentication, so you can log in with your fingerprint or face if your phone allows. Sadly, you need a pricey subscription (Arlo Secure costs $8 per month for one camera or $13 per month for unlimited cameras) for subject recognition, smart alerts, and cloud storage. This is the upgrade pick in our best indoor security cameras guide. —Simon Hill While it’s not our top pick, Google’s Nest Cam does make our list of the best outdoor security cameras and is a solid choice if you have a Nest Doorbell or other Google gadgets. The HD resolution is limited, but that’s offset by the HDR and high frame rate, and the face recognition is the best we have tested in a security camera. The Nest Aware subscription at $8 a month ($80/year) is too much if you only have a single camera, but that price covers multiple devices. —Simon Hill I love my Reolink doorbell, which does everything I need it to without the hassles of a glitchy app that needs to be updated every two weeks or any monthly fee. Don’t take my word for it, though: When my curling club needed a security system, another club member, who installs security cameras professionally, suggested we skip pricier options and just do a Reolink system. We’ve got an Reolink Altas PT Ultra (on sale for $160, which is $70 off) running inside over the bar and a solar-powered REOLINK Argus 4 Pro (on sale for $140 which is $80 off) running in the parking lot, which has drawn rave reviews based on the low cost (curling is a Scottish sport and thriftiness is part of the culture) and the fact that the whole leadership structure can access the footage from their phones via the Home Hub ($99). —Martin Cizmar These affordable Govee Wi-Fi Water Sensors are quick and easy to install, and send alerts as push notifications and emails to warn you when there’s a leak. With a very loud siren (100 decibels) you will hear them if you are home, and you can shut off the sound from the app. The sensors are compact with drip detection on top and metal feet for leak detection beneath. Alerts triggered within a few seconds in my tests, earning them a place in our best water leak detectors guide. The app is basic but works well and gives you an alert history. They do require a Govee Wi-Fi hub (included), which needs a power outlet, and it’s big enough that it may block an adjacent outlet. Each sensor also needs two AA batteries (provided). —Simon Hill Mattresses are frequently advertised with inflated discounts, and this mattress from Nectar was only $100 more than this earlier in November. However, it’s still a big discount on an all-foam mattress that’s solidly on the soft side despite being advertised as “medium firm.” —Martin Cizmar The original millennial bed-in-a-box has been sold a few times in recent years and recently went through a full-line redesign. I was impressed with the new Casper baseline mattress during my week of testing, as it retains a classic memory foam feel but is more firm and supportive than many competitors. We originally linked the queen version but it's not available, other sizes are. —Martin Cizmar Brooklinen's Cyber Monday sale ends on Tuesday night, with 25 percent off the entire site and up to 50 percent off bundles. There are a ton of great sheets worth shopping there, from the linen to the sateen, but Brooklinen's percale is my favorite of their sheet options. It's a nice crisp sheet and has an organic option (on sale for $172) that's a touch softer than the regular version. Both the organic and the classic percale sets are on sale right now for 25 percent off. —Nena Farrell Cozy Earth's Bamboo Sheet Set has been on the top of our Best Sheets guide ever since we started testing sheets, and it’s a star of our new Best Bamboo Sheets guide, too. These sheets, made with bamboo viscose, feel insanely soft and downright chilly to the touch before warming up like melted butter around you as you sleep. It's a downright decadent sheet set that's usually a splurge, which is why Cozy Earth's sale is the perfect time to shop. —Nena Farrell I've tried a lot of wearable breast pumps. They're supremely handy to use, but the Medela Freestyle (7/10, WIRED Recommends) will always be a favorite of mine because it was the most lightweight and had the least amount of parts to clean. And if you pump often, or even just once a day, having less cleaning to do feels like a lifesaver. The motor is in the handheld controller that you can pop in your pocket rather than weighing down your bra. It's comfortable, handy, and on sale for a great price compared to what you'll usually find it for. —Nena Farrell This handy little drill is a home tool kit essential. It’s got enough power to handle tasks that need extra torque, and the half-inch chuck will accept basically every drill bit size. This kit includes two batteries and a charger, and the batteries are also compatible with other DeWalt tools. This deal comes within $10 of the best we’ve seen. If you need bits, we recommend this kit, which is also on sale. —Louryn Strampe This inexpensive kit is full of our favorite drill bits. The black oxide coating both reduces friction and resists rust, and the drill bits can handle wood, metal, plastics, wallboard, and fiberglass. These go on sale frequently, but this is still a good get, especially if you’re picking up the discounted DeWalt drill that we also recommend. —Louryn Strampe Luxome's bamboo sheets are the best bamboo sheets you can buy, with fantastic quality made from bamboo viscose (which is better than bamboo rayon!), tons of gorgeous colors from which to choose, a fantastically silky-soft feel, and a good price point. Luxome is hosting its only sale of the year right now, so you can get these amazing sheets for even cheaper than usual. The white color has an extra $5 discount if you don’t mind missing out on the gorgeous ocean and terracotta colors. —Nena Farrell Casper's Hybrid Snow Pillow is our favorite pillow, period. It might not seem like it at first touch, but this pillow is super supportive for your head with its foam core and soft memory fiber surrounding it. Former WIRED reviewer Eric Ravenscraft found it to be his go-to pillow after testing tons of pillows for our guide. He says it's cooling, too, which is a nice bonus. He recommends catching it on sale, making now the ideal time to shop to get a little discount. —Nena Farrell This highly rated and reviewed body pillow on Amazon is my personal cheap pick for the Best Body Pillows for its relatively large size and comfiness. The plush fiber filling is soft enough that it can be contorted into many shapes and isn’t overstuffed, making it super easy to wrap your arms and legs around. The pillow refills back to shape without the filling getting bunched in one area or just going flat after a few weeks like some cheaper body pillows. I liked this super-soft pillow, and it’s a really great deal at a fraction of the price of other body pillows with comparable comfort. —Molly Higgins This large wall map is gorgeous. The world is shiny gold until countries and states are scratched off with a coin. It’s a great way to track your adventures, whether close to home or international. The colored areas of the map have nice details like major cities and topography, and while they’re appealing to look at, they’re also neutral enough that they’ll fit in with any decor. Check out our guide for more great gifts for travelers. —Louryn Strampe Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Branch’s Ergonomic Chair is my first recommendation for anyone who just wants to upgrade their crappy old seat without spending a fortune. It’s not perfect, but it’s quite adjustable, works for people of varying heights, and the high-density foam seat is cushy. You can lock the recline and adjust the lumbar support, and it helps that it’s also a very stylish office chair compared to its plain black competitors. For more discounts at Branch, read our separate story here. —Julian Chokkattu If your office chair budget is a little higher, then consider the Branch Verve. The main thing to note is that the arms are fixed—they can go up and down but not side to side. That’s my only real gripe with this chair; everything else is a nice upgrade over the Branch Ergonomic Chair, from build quality to back support. It also looks even more elegant, and there’s a headrest add-on if you want to shut your eyes and nap for a bit in between Zoom meetings. —Julian Chokkattu This chair is best suited for people under 5’9,” as it gave me back pain after several days in it (I’m 6’4”). After I asked a friend around 5’4” to try it, they liked it a lot and had no major qualms. It has a mesh back and a thick foam seat. Too bad it looks very, very dull. But maybe you want something nondescript! —Julian Chokkattu When it comes to writing, there’s nothing quite like the smooth 0.7 mm glide of the Paper Mate InkJoy Gel Pens. With 14 bold colors to choose from, this set is a rainbow of possibilities; whether you’re color-coding, writing in a planner, or doodling, their versatility and flair have earned them a permanent spot in our writing toolkit. —Boutayna Chokrane We love paper planners around here, and our favorite weekly planner is the Happy Planner. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano found herself purchasing it year after year, and I can see why. It's got plenty of space for writing down plans and to-do lists, lots of fun covers, and a great price point. Score a planner for the new year (or a gift for your favorite planner person!) with Happy Planner's 30 percent off sale. —Nena Farrell It’s never too late to get organized and Class Tracker makes the best paper planners for students. There are monthly calendars, but the weekly pages shine. Each day sports a section for things to remember, tests, papers, or projects due, and larger spots for assignments and a daily plan. A Self-Care Corner gives you space for non-school things to focus on and a countdown box for something you're looking forward to. If you or the student in your life is struggling to get organized, this planner could help. —Simon Hill The Ryzen 9 7950X is one of AMD’s most powerful CPUs, and is on a steep discount. Anyone building a new PC or looking to upgrade theirs for raw computing power will want to check out this 16-core, 32-thread monster. The already ultra-fast 4.5GHz base clock can be pushed even higher with overclocking, making this an excellent choice for demanding workloads like video editing or 3D rendering. It’s also the perfect counterpart to a high-end GPU for the best possible experience in any video game. —Brad Bourque Logitech has a long history of great keyboards, and the MX Mechanical Mini is no exception. This wireless keyboard packs backlit keys, wired or wireless connectivity, and low-profile mechanical switches in your choice of tactile quiet, clicky, or linear. If you’ve got tons of devices, you should know the MX Mini also has wide support for operating systems and devices, including iOS. That makes this one of our favorite upgraded keyboards for tablet power users who want to unfold for a bit into a proper workstation. —Brad Bourque We recommended this Wi-Fi 6E system in our best mesh routers guide until it was replaced by the newer XE70 Pro, but this is still a good choice, especially with the discount. It is a tri-band (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz) mesh with impressive range and stability. Each of the three routers has three Gigabit ports. By default, the 6-GHz band is reserved for wireless backhaul, but you can open it up for devices. If you have a connection of 1 Gbps or less, this mesh will serve you well. While enhanced security and parental controls require subscriptions, most folks can live without them. —Simon Hill Few USB webcams can match the Logitech C920 Pro’s quality, and at $50—half its usual price—it’s a bargain. With crisp 1080p and autofocus, it works great for video calls and streaming. Its white color balance is similar to the Razer webcam, and while the 78-degree field of view can be a bit tight, it just requires manual adjustments. It’s also missing a privacy shutter, but for a high-performing webcam, this is an unbeatable price. —Boutayna Chokrane The best Wi-Fi 6E router in our best routers guide, this hexagonal Asus router impressed in my tests. It’s a tri-band router, adding the 6-GHz band to the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz. The new band is very fast, though it is relatively low range and doesn’t penetrate through walls very well. There’s ample connectivity with a 2.5-Gbps WAN/LAN port, a second 1-Gbps WAN/LAN, and a further three gigabit LANs. Asus also offers free security and parental controls and all the settings you need in the mobile app and browser interface, including band-splitting, prioritization for different activities, guest network, VPN support, and so on. —Simon Hill This affordable security camera is our pick of the best indoor security cameras because it offers clear 2K footage, with a starlight sensor that enables color night vision. Smart detection (people, pets, and vehicles) is handy, and the slightly laggy two-way audio is fine. Pop in a microSD card (up to 512 GB) for local recording, or opt for a Tapo Care subscription for 30 days of cloud storage that starts at $3.50 per month. It also has an IP66 rating so it can be used outdoors. —Simon Hill This cute little indoor security camera is a cheaper version of our favorite model. It loses some features, like pet and vehicle detection, but TP-Link has reliable motion detection and customizable notifications. It's often on sale for around $20, but you can get it for extra cheap right now. —Nena Farrell Gamers don’t need a special gaming router, but if you love customizable RGB lighting, this mesh will tempt you. It’s not just fancy lighting that makes it worth a look, because this tri-band Asus ROG Rapture GT6 finished high up the table in most tests. With a single 2.4-GHz band and two 5-GHz bands (one is used for backhaul unless you connect the routers with an Ethernet cable), it can keep all your gaming gear online. The 5-GHz band supports wider 160-MHz channels and WPA3 for security. You also get AiProtection security software and comprehensive parental controls included without a subscription. The game modes boost performance and prioritize gaming traffic, and each router has a 2.5 Gbps WAN port, three 1 gigabit LAN ports, and a USB 3.2 Gen 1 port. —Simon Hill If you’re working in a hot environment, I highly suggest you get an all-mesh seat. These kinds of office chairs maximize airflow, allowing body heat to dissipate instead of trapping it. The Ergo3D has all the main points of adjustment you’d want and it’s a roomy chair. You even get two kinds of wheels in the box (casters or rollerblades) and you can insert whichever works best for your flooring. It’s not my favorite all-mesh chair, but it’s one of the few decent ones you’ll find south of $500. —Julian Chokkattu The SM57 is the most-used instrument mic in the history of recorded audio, by a large factor. It sounds great on guitar amps and beyond, and can be used to record essentially anything you need in a pinch. I’d stick to the extremely similar SM58 if you need a vocal mic, but if you need to record anything else, an SM57 is a must-have. —Parker Hall If you asked a child to draw a picture of a microphone, you’d get an image of the Shure SM58. This standard of stage and studio is so rugged you can use it as a hammer and it will still sound great after, though I don’t recommend you dent that iconic grille too soon. The dynamic microphone works great with any audio interface, and has a sound that you’ll be very familiar with if you’ve ever seen anyone sing live. —Parker Hall Shure’s SM7B microphone has been a studio staple for decades. While it’s gotten subtle improvements over the years, including an upgraded voice coil and a larger windscreen, it’s changed very little in its long tenure–you don’t mess with perfection. You’ll see this mic in multiple movies and TV shows (once you know it you can’t unsee it), as well as in real studios worldwide. It’s a killer option for podcasting and talk radio and works great as a vocal mic too. It’s designed to bring the best of your vocals to light, with little coloration so you just get the gritty goodness your unique voice provides. This is among the few standards I recommend first for any singer or creator, along with other favorites like the Electrovoice RE20, the do-it-all AKG C414, and the classic Shure SM58. —Ryan Waniata Every system needs a hard drive, and WD has been providing them for as long as I can remember. It’s nothing groundbreaking, but taking some dollars off this 1-TB internal drive might make it a more appealing second drive, or the main SSD in a budget-friendly system. With read speeds up to 560 MBps, you might not want to spend a ton of time transferring files on and off this drive, but it’s more than adequate enough for gaming and daily use, and priced well to boot. —Brad Bourque Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Asus Chromebook Plus CX34 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best-looking Chromebook you can buy. The beautiful white design stands out in a sea of gray slabs. The Core i5 CPU offers plenty of performance to easily handle multiple tabs and app juggling. The webcam is nice too, much crisper than you’d expect for a $500 laptop. The downside is there's no backlit keyboard. —Scott Gilbertson The 13-inch Surface Laptop (7th Edition) (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite processor. Performance was good in our testing. It did not bog down no matter how many windows, tabs, and apps we threw at it. That said, this is not a machine for graphics-intensive tasks, like video editing or gaming (which is a shame because the vivid sharp screen with a 120-Hz screen refresh rate would be great for gaming). —Scott Gilbertson Dell's two larger XPS laptops (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are aimed at Windows users with MacBook jealousy. The design, specs, and sizes align perfectly with Apple's offerings. The XPS 14 has a gorgeous, sleek design (though it's thicker than a MacBook), a wonderfully bright and sharp OLED screen (with 120-Hz screen refresh rates), and is plenty speedy for everyday tasks. Unfortunately, heavy-duty tasks like video editing … well, the MacBook's benchmarks run circles around the XPS 14. Still, with this deal, this is a serious piece of hardware for not a lot of money. —Scott Gilbertson There's much to love about Samsung's Galaxy Book4 (7/10, WIRED Review), but let's be honest, that sticker price is insane. This deal brings it down somewhat, though it's still pricey. You do get impressive hardware—the new Intel Core Ultra 9 185H processor and current top-of-the-line processor in Intel’s Core Ultra CPU lineup, along with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card. The 16-inch AMOLED 2,880 x 1,800 pixels touchscreen is magnificent to work on and performance blew everything else we've tested out of the water. —Scott Gilbertson Who says you always have to buy the latest and greatest? If you get a tablet from Samsung’s 2023 Tab S9 series, you can save some serious cash and get an equally great experience (7/10, WIRED Recommends). The Tab S9 is the smallest, and next comes the Tab S9+, both of which have AMOLED screens and are IP68-rated for water resistance. The Tab S9 Ultra is down to $800 ($400 off), and it’s massive and designed to be a travel-friendly computer when you don’t want to lug a laptop around. Also, check out the Galaxy Tab S9 FE and Galaxy Tab FE+. If you just want a tablet to watch some shows, read, and play some games, these affordable slates are better than their predecessors, with smoother performance, and you still get a stylus in the box. They’re nearly identical—the FE+ just has more RAM and a bigger screen. —Julian Chokkattu The Galaxy Tab S10 series is the iPad Pro-equivalent of the Android world. The Tab S10+ has a reasonable 12.4-inch screen size, but the Tab S10 Ultra sports a massive 14.6-inch screen that is unwieldy to hold—you’ll want to pair it with a kickstand case. The Ultra is on sale for $1,000 ($200 off), but the Tab S10+ is much better value overall. You get the S Pen included for doodling and note-taking, the AMOLED screen is stunning, and it will receive 7 years of software updates. My primary issue is the price, and it’s still expensive at $850, but if you want the best tablet Android has to offer, this is it. —Julian Chokkattu You might think that giving your grandparents an older tablet might be fine, but things can get complicated fast if they’re not familiar with the software. Enter the GrandPad (8/10, WIRED Recommends). The company has been around for a decade and offers a custom tablet experience designed for seniors. That means larger touch targets, an easy-to-follow user interface, and LTE connectivity out of the box. There’s also 24/7 customer care and emergency 911 calling in case something happens. They won’t ever need to plug it in—just have them place it on the wireless charging dock and it’ll always be at the ready. The downside is this all involves a pricey subscription plan. If you buy directly from GrandPad, you get $100 off the annual subscription, but if you buy directly from Amazon, you get $100 off the tablet itself. You can’t use the tablet without a subscription. —Julian Chokkattu Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Bose’s Smart Soundbar (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite mini bar, even if it’s on the pricier side for a small bar that doesn’t come with a dedicated subwoofer. That means you’re sacrificing some punch down low, but in its place you’re getting fantastic immersion thanks to true upfiring drivers (something the Sonos Beam doesn’t have), Wi-Fi streaming and networking, and some innovative audio features. Those include a new AI dialog mode that brings forth voices and center-channel information with remarkable clarity. You can also now use the brand’s Open Earbuds as clip-on personal surround speakers. The Bose app is simple and intuitive, and lets you easily add other speakers like a Bose Bass module down the line. —Ryan Waniata Every TV deserves better sound, and this cheap soundbar and wireless subwoofer from Yamaha is a great way to get it. It’s super easy to set up with a simple HDMI eARC connection, and it brings a shocking amount of depth to content you probably watched through tinny TV speakers. Its little brother, the SR-C20A, has been our best soundbar for most of the year, and this brings more bass at a now-discounted price. —Parker Hall Sonos’ indomitable Arc (9/10, WIRED Recommends) has new competition from within courtesy of the Arc Ultra, which offers subtle but impactful sonic improvements and the ability to connect over 5GHz Wi-Fi. At $1,000, though, it’s not the best fit for all budgets. The regular Arc is still a winner, providing full and warm sound, excellent detail for dialog and music, and impressive immersion for surround sound and Dolby Atmos soundtracks via side- and up-firing drivers. Like other Sonos gear, you can add surround speakers or the new Sub 4 subwoofer, or connect with other speakers for all the multi-room audio tricks upon which Sonos made its name. You’ll also get built-in microphones for smart home control. Though Sonos’ app has had its struggles lately, it seems to be on more solid ground. If you’ve been waiting on a potent standalone bar with room for larger aspirations, this Arc deal is worth grabbing. —Ryan Waniata Klipsch’s Flexus Core 200 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) sounds bigger and brawnier than you’d expect for the money, pushing toward bars that cost twice as much. Its MDF construction (in place of plastic) offers deep and musical resonance, and its upfiring drives expand the sound to accentuate Dolby Atmos films and TV shows to cinematic heights (literally). Dialog is also clear and present thanks to a dedicated center channel. The trade-off is that there’s no Wi-Fi support as you’d expect for this price, but the bar is not without its innovative extras. As the name implies, the system provides flexible expansion with available surround speakers and a thumpy subwoofer. This bar is one of the best soundbars around for those who put sound quality first at full price, and a true bargain on sale. —Ryan Waniata Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals It’s hard to think of a more stalwart consumer electronics product over the last decade than Sony’s WH-1000XM4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). Even four years after their debut, they serve as a benchmark for new contenders and premium offerings from top players alike. Their noise canceling isn’t top tier, but it’s still very good, and a raft of features—from a multi-band EQ to a touch control that turns on transparency mode temporarily for announcements or quick conversations—makes them feel advanced even as they gracefully age. Their sound is warm and bassy, yet refreshingly refined, and their durable plastic shells harbor plush padding for hours of comfort. You can outdo these noise cancelers with the latest Bose QuietComfort Ultra or Sony’s step-up WH-1000XM5, but there’s no question as to why Sony’s kept them around for multiple generations. —Ryan Waniata Technics isn’t the first name you think of for wireless earbuds, but the EAH-AZ80 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are among the best earbuds out there for their mix of a snug and comfy fit, great features, solid noise canceling, and sterling sound. The flashy gleam of their endcaps seems to tease their sound signature, which is slick, clear, and deeply textural to bring instruments to life. The AZ80’s noise canceling doesn’t catch Bose or even Sony’s top buds, but it’s good enough, and multipoint pairing with three different devices at once makes these buds uniquely versatile. This is a great pair at a good price, making them worth grabbing for those who put fit and sound quality first. Only the silver come in at the lowest price, but other colors are also steeply discounted. —Ryan Waniata Soundpeats has a knack for making affordable earbuds with exceptionally good sound. In fact, we recently gave their latest pair that uses a new kind of driver, the Soundcapsule 3+, a perfect 10/10. The Air4 Pro (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are not that pair, but they serve up clear and balanced sound along with solid noise canceling for a very low asking price. They don’t have the spoils you’ll get in flagships like the AirPods Pro (even if they look a lot like them), but for well below $100 they’re a worthy option that could make a great gift for the budding music lover in your life. —Ryan Waniata Need a cheap pair of earbuds to not think too much about? Look no further than the Go Air Pop, which are utterly usable earbuds that cost less than $20. I like keeping a pair in my car or gym bag for when I forget to bring nicer buds with me and still want music. —Parker Hall I didn’t set out to love the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds (7/10, WIRED recommends). Even on sale, they’re pricey for such a limited use case, but damn if they haven’t become my favorite open earbuds on the market. Their curlicue barrel design takes some getting used to, but they roll onto your ears with impressive tenacity, staying put without pinching tight. Once in place, the little sound beams from their snake-like acoustic housings offer the most well-rounded performance I’ve heard in the genre. Like other open-ear models, you won’t get noise canceling or isolation so the sound is always blended with the world around you, but it’s a fantastic trick for working out or staying aware in any number of situations. These aren’t the best earbuds for every scenario, but if you can spend up for a targeted pair of standby buds alongside your best noise-canceling buds, you may just fall for them too. —Ryan Waniata Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra headphones (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are premium in style and performance, as you’d expect from the best noise-canceling headphones on the market. Their plush and ergonomic design makes them a joy to wear, while their penchant for noise-strangling makes them the ultimate choice for serious travelers or those who simply need unparalleled tranquility in their home or office. I also really enjoy the sound, which is less forward than Bose flagships past, while still providing excellent instrumental separation and deft balance. The battery provides a solid 30 hours per charge and the headphones add futuristic features like 3D audio virtualization with head-tracking to feel more like a pair of speakers. At well over $400, these are a serious splurge, but at this price they feel more like a steal. —Ryan Waniata The Jabra Elite series have been our top pick in our guide to workout headphones for years. Unfortunately, the company recently decided to stop making them. Although the earbuds have an unusually long two-year warranty, some of my colleagues would counsel you not to pick them. However, these are still the most comfortable and secure workout headphones that I’ve tried. They have an unusual feature, which is that you can plug the case into a 3.5-mm headphone jack to listen to them on a plane. It’s neat! These are still great for travel! —Adrienne So Jabra’s Elite 4 Active (9/10, WIRED Recommends) were almost shockingly good upon release a couple of years back, and they’re still an excellent buy today–especially on sale. As part of Jabra’s sporty overhaul, they blend serious durability with a comfy fit, smooth and balanced sound, and plenty of ways to personalize the experience in the Jabra app. They even provide a slab of noise canceling, though it’s more of an aid to their noise-isolating fit. They’re also dust and water-resistant, meaning you can dunk them or rinse them after a sweaty workout with no ill effects. Jabra has called it quits on consumer earbuds, but the stalwart brand pledges to support its current products through its warranty, so there’s no reason to hesitate. —Ryan Waniata Sony’s WH-1000XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) take nearly everything we loved about the previous model a step further, offering a mix of fabulous features and excellent noise canceling, comfort, and sound quality. These headphones have everything, from multipoint pairing and auto-pause sensors to brilliant touch commands and Amazon Alexa support. They’re perfect for travel, but just as handy for wearing around the house. They’re not quite as packable as the previous model, the XM4, but that’s really the only flaw in an otherwise near-perfect package. —Ryan Waniata These bone-conduction headphones are the option you’re probably most likely to see in the wild. They use your jaw bones to route sound to your ears, which means you can hear everything around. This version is smaller than the newer second generation, which makes them better for folks with smaller heads (there is also a mini version on sale). —Parker Hall Jabra may be getting out of the earbud game, but the Elite 5 are still excellent earbuds that should last for many years of solid use. They’re comfortable and durable (IP55 rated), and the hybrid noise cancellation makes them great on flights or calls. Sound quality is excellent, with bold bass and enough midrange that you can hear every detail of the guitar or piano. —Parker Hall These are some of our favorite gifts for new parents, though anyone who experiences overstimulation might benefit from them. They’re designed for concerts to slightly reduce noise while still letting you hear. That makes them perfect for parents who need a little break from sleep training or the soundtrack of the Terrible Twos. You’ll still hear your kiddo, but you’ll be able to focus on their needs instead of that otherworldly screeching that can only be produced by a colicky newborn. —Louryn Strampe Denon’s PerL earbuds (7/10, WIRED Reviewed) don’t fit or feel quite like traditional earbuds, but their sound is seriously impressive thanks to the most advanced personalization system I’ve tested in the genre. These buds tune to your hearing profile, which for me equated to richer, fuller, and more intimate sound across my catalog. The profile they create may take some time to lock in, but once you do, it’s an impressive ride. I wasn’t convinced with the overall execution at $200, but at half the price, this is a killer deal for serious listeners. —Ryan Waniata The fully tweakable noise canceling inside these reflective workout earbuds makes them great for folks who like to be aware of their surroundings when outdoors but enjoy a bit of silence when inside. They have excellent sound quality and call quality and work as intended, allowing you to adjust how much of the outside world you want to hear at any given moment with easy-to-use touch controls. —Parker Hall Kids are extremely susceptible to hearing loss, which is why WIRED staffers who are parents love headphones like these that limit output to the OSHA-recommended 85 decibels. The noise canceling is excellent and will help with louder noises on flights or from HVAC, and these also come in either pink or blue, so you can get whichever color your kiddo prefers. —Parker Hall Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The WIRED Gear team battles over who gets to review each generation of this adorable Bluetooth speaker, because it’s just so handy. A tiny little rubber strap lets you attach it to everything from handlebars to backpacks. It sounds shockingly good for its size, too, and a rugged IP67 rating means you don’t need to worry if it takes a spill. —Parker Hall Ultimate Ears makes some of our favorite speakers, and the Boom series is a standout. An update of the relatively ancient Boom 3, the Boom 4 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) brings long-awaited USB-C charging and modestly redesigned drivers. Its performance offers the same clear, smooth, and balanced presentation we’ve come to expect from the series. You’ll also get up to 15 hours of battery life, the ability to stereo pair with another Boom 4, and plenty of ways to adjust the sound in the app. This isn’t the bassiest speaker for its size, but its sound is more refined than cheaper knock-offs. Its primary drawback is its high price, which makes now the right time to strike. —Ryan Waniata Marshall’s pivot to rock-inspired Bluetooth speakers has been very successful from a product standpoint. These robust speakers feature great design and even better sound, plus I like that they have a strap that makes them easy to carry with other items when you’re packing in to a campsite. Twenty hours of playtime and 20 watts of output means you’ll be jamming loud and for a while, and an IPX4 rating means this is fine in the rain. —Parker Hall The best Bluetooth speakers offer a mix of durability, sound quality, and aesthetics, which is exactly how I’d describe this mid-tier model from Ultimate Ears. The folks who design these spend a lot of time testing their limits, from drop tests to bleach testing them in the desert sun, and that makes them great for folks who tend to be harder on consumer electronics. If you have a fisherman, hunter, or contractor in your life, UE is the brand for you. —Parker Hall Round Bluetooth speakers like this one might seem hard to place, but the built-in leather strap that comes with the Beosound A1 makes it very easy to hang anywhere you might need to. It’s a very well-made speaker, with a sleek metal exterior that can survive a heck of a lot of abuse. The normal downside is the price, which is negated by this deal. —Parker Hall JBL’s Authentics 200 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) speaks fluent Google and Alexa, letting you pick your smart home poison. That means it can act as a controller for multiple types of smart home products without the need for unifying smart protocols like Matter. The speaker’s stylish retro design provides further appeal, with a chunky foam grille reminiscent of JBL’s ’70s audiophile designs and real knobs for EQ and volume. Most important, the Authentics sounds fantastic, with warm and vibey mids, crisp treble, and wavy bass you can feel through the floor when it gets humming. Sonos models like the Era 100 and Era 300 are top of mind for most seeking an acoustically sound Wi-Fi speaker, but don’t sleep on the 200, especially at this new low price. —Ryan Waniata Bose’s newest Soundlink speaker is also its most expensive, but this sale makes its potent sound and size a lot more approachable. In his review, WIRED contributor Siman Lucas called the Max’s sound “as big, bold, and…upfront as it looks,” touting its penchant for refined bass and uncommon care for the rest of the frequency spectrum. That’s a great mix for a bass-forward model. It also proffers extras like 20 hours of battery life, IP67 weatherproofing, and a slick, travel-friendly design, making it among the very best Bluetooth speakers of its kind. —Ryan Waniata The only real downside to JBL’s best Bluetooth speakers is their high price. Grabbing them on a good sale is key, which makes this Clip 5 deal a top target. The perfect shower speaker does much more than just belt out your morning tunes. Its titular clip makes it easy to bring camping, attach it to your bike, or even clip it on your belt buckle as you clean up your yard or take the dog for a spin. The sound is full and surprisingly warm, with good detail and more bass than most pint-size rivals. Other features include 12 hours of battery (or 15 hours with the battery saver mode) and JBL’s handy app for adjusting the sound or connecting with other JBL models. —Ryan Waniata I loved the new Pill (8/10, WIRED Recommends) at full price, and at $100 or less it’s arguably the best value for a bass-thumping portable out there. The speaker matches musical low-end poise with swift instrumental attacks and vivid high-register detail. At times it pushes toward sharpness, but mainly stays free to provide an exhilarating sound signature with plenty of punch. It adds loads of features, including high-res audio support via USB-C input, one-touch pairing for Android or iOS, and 24 hours of battery life per charge, to make it among the best you can buy. It’s all encapsulated (sorry) in a premium design with IP67 weather protection for outdoor adventures. —Ryan Waniata I tested the R81+ of this Fluance for our Best Turntables guide, which adds a slightly upgraded cartridge and a platter with a more advanced dampener. Still, I would not hesitate to recommend this version, especially at just over $200. The R81’s best features are its solid build quality including a lift-lower mechanism that seems far too good for a turntable at this price. —Martin Cizmar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Fellow Aiden (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the most talked about coffee devices this year. It’s a sleek update on the classic Mr. Coffee from the 1970s: A drip machine to make drip coffee seem kinda cool again. It’s easy to use, it can be customized to each roast or bean with a simple dial twirl, and our reviewer marveled at how good the coffee was. The device is on sale but only if you also buy a bean grinder. Luckily, the Fellow Opus is also the WIRED Gear team’s favorite overall grinder in existence. —Matthew Korfhage The Breville Barista Express is the lowest priced all-in-one espresso maker and frother we’ve found that’ll compete with the thousand-dollar big boys—a sturdy machine with precision, power, grace, and staying power. This is a longtime Gear team favorite: WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu has kept this on his counter for a half-decade. The slightly upgraded Pro version is also on sale this weekend, for about hundred more. —Matthew Korfhage The grinder on this surprisingly svelte KitchenAid machine (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is quite literally the quietest we’ve tested or measured, a whisper of a device that might not wake your significant other or your roommate when you desperately need a 6 am shot. The machine is thoughtfully and intuitively put together, but coffee dosing can be a bit finicky at first: Our Gear team testers noted it might take a few tries before you get it dialed just right. —Matthew Korfhage The Terra Kaffe is a pricey hunk of coffee machinery and has its bugs, but it’s one of few on earth to offer not just quality espresso and macchiato, but also true drip coffee that’s not Americano in disguise. This all arrives in a nifty, easy-to-clean package with a smart screen and all the trimmings. Using a phone app, you can begin warming the machine up from your bed, just like a remote starter on your car. Anyway, it’s a whopping $600 off, with an extra hundo off the top if you sign on for a coffee subscription. —Matthew Korfhage This is the best bean grinder we’ve found under $100, hands down. At the moment, it costs even less than that. At 16 inches high, the Oxo is a little tall to fit under a kitchen cabinet. But it’s durable, and it’s got a slim profile and a truly surprising ability to dial down to fine espresso grinds. —Matthew Korfhage The pricier Fellow or Baratza grinders likely win on overall execution. But what our Gear team testers prized greatly in KitchenAid’s burr grinder was its beauteous ease of cleaning, with burrs accessibly placed just beneath the hopper. Over the life of the product, this can matter more than you expect. We also liked the precise dose control and the helpful guidelines on grind settings. The universal merit of KitchenAid devices kind of tends to just be that they’re considerate of their users: “user-friendly,” to coin a term. Anyway, this is the lowest price we’ve seen on this model. —Matthew Korfhage The Cafe Barista was already our budget pick among fully automated cafe and espresso machines, and right now it’s on significant discount. If you don’t mind the plasticky casing, this low-cost device will make you a rich single or double espresso with a single push of the button, not to mention lattes and cappuccinos. —Matthew Korfhage This is what I use when I make cold brew at home. It’s an elegant, slim-profiled, no-fuss update to the classic Toddy device your favorite cafe probably uses to make a $5 cup of cold brew. Spoon in coffee, pour water over the nifty “rainmaker” top, then let it all sit for 16 to 24 hours. Filtering is as easy as sticking the immersion chamber atop the carafe. It takes patience, but not effort. And the resulting cold brew is delicious. —Matthew Korfhage Do you have a coffee lover on your gift list? Trade coffee is our favorite option for those who want variety, and this deal can get variety delivered to your loved one's door for less. Trade Coffee doesn't roast coffee. Instead, it acts as a middleman between small roasters around the country and you. Trade Coffee makes it possible to get specialty coffee beans from boutique roasters around the US without going on an epic road trip (though that would be a great road trip, so if you have the time, go for it, and send a postcard). —Scott Gilbertson Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Amazon Echo Dot (5th Gen) is truly tiny yet powerful. It’s the Alexa smart speaker I find myself always having set up somewhere in my house, even if I’m testing other voice assistants. This smart speaker might only be a few inches tall, but its audio quality can almost rival the larger Echos. The small footprint makes it easy to add almost anywhere in your home, too. The only downside is the price for such a small speaker, but this sale fixes that. —Nena Farrell If you want a smart display, this is the Goldilocks of the lot. The Echo Show 8 is the perfect size with its 8-inch screen to use for all kinds of features—smart home control, music player, video calls, even a little movie streaming—and packs a great speaker, a smart home hub, and a 13 MP camera. Use it as a digital photo frame, a smart home control center, or just a music jam session. Not only is this smart display fantastic, but it's nearly half off right now and available for the best price we've seen all year. —Nena Farrell The Echo Pop (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the cheapest Amazon Echo speaker on a normal day, and it's the only one you'll find for under $20. It's downright adorable, with a half-moon shape and a couple of fun colors you won't find in other Amazon speakers. It's not the most impressive speaker—no surprise with the smaller form factor it has—but it's not bad for the price, plus you'll get all the usual features of a smart speaker in it. —Nena Farrell Amazon's lineup of smart speakers is huge, but it all started with the true Amazon Echo. The fourth-gen model has an orb shape, rather than the tower of the first few models. But the updated shape also comes with fuller sound that can better fill a room and a built-in smart home hub that can connect to your devices directly over Matter or Zigbee. It's a great speaker and smart assistant, and the twilight blue color is on sale for half off. You can also find the black and white colors on sale for $5 more. —Nena Farrell If you want something just to control your smart home and answer your questions, nothing more, then the Amazon Echo Hub (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is for you. This Amazon Echo speaker is designed to be wall-mounted, and looks like a smart home panel a custom designer would put into your home. Instead of needing your own designer and electricians to set this up, you'll just need your Alexa app and devices that work with it. The Echo Hub isn't meant for any other tricks; it has a speaker, but it's intentionally mediocre, and you'll be prompted to choose a different Amazon Echo in your home to be the primary sound device if you use the Hub for music. It's meant to be a companion to the rest of your existing smart home ecosystem, and as someone who primarily controls her smart home with her speakers, I love it. —Nena Farrell Not to quote my own review, but the Amazon Echo Spot (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is small yet surprisingly helpful. This second-gen model is back after being discontinued, with an updated look that matches the vibe of the Echo Pop that launched last summer (that's on sale too!). I was surprised how much I liked it—it takes my favorite quick-glance smart display features, shows me the weather and my calendar when I ask, and leaves out all of the clutter. It's a solid speaker for casual listening, though the Echo Dot is still the best of the pint-sized Amazon speakers. It's ideal for a bedside table, but I also like it for my desk. It's on sale for almost half off, so it's a great time to get one if you want it. —Nena Farrell Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Canopy is our overall favorite among the suddenly ubiquitous filtered showerheads that now promise to remove all sorts of things from your water, presumably keeping your hair and skin more lustrous. Unlike many such filters, we discovered during testing that the Canopy does in fact remove troublesome chlorine compounds before its spray hits your hair and skin. It's also a good-looking showerhead with multiple spray settings and a lot of considerate touches that make it easy to use. Note that filters require replacement every three months or so, at $25-$35 a pop. —Matthew Korfhage I go through a lot of heat protectants while testing hair straighteners for our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, and R+Co Bleu’s Hypersonic Heat Styling Mist is one of my go-to. It protects up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (also great for hair dryers and curling irons) and goes on kind of thick, like hairspray, so it’s definitely effective at fighting frizz but also isn’t so heavy that it weighs hair down. It also comes in sustainable packaging and is Leaping Bunny certified to be cruelty-free. All of R+Co’s products are 30 percent off, so R+Co’s diatomaceous earth-based Skyline Dry Shampoo is also worth a grab if you need a TSA-compliant dry shampoo for travel or are trying to stay away from aerosols. On the subject of hair products, IGK is also offering 30 percent off everything on its site. While testing for an upcoming guide to the Best Heat Protectants we’ve also become quite fond of IGK’s Good Behavior Smoothing Spray (protects up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit), which is $10 off in the sale. —Kat Merck This was a past budget pick in our electric toothbrush guide, and it’s still a great, affordable toothbrush. It’s cute, thin, and has a gentle cleaning vibration as a sonic toothbrush. It comes with a carrying case, too. —Nena Farrell Sonic toothbrushes are a little gentler than your standard oscillating toothbrush, and the Philips 4100 Sonicare is our favorite sonic toothbrush we’ve tried. We already like the 4100 for all the features it packs at its price point—two intensity levels, a pressure sensor, and a two-minute timer—and those features are an even better deal right now while this toothbrush is on sale. —Nena Farrell The Series 9 is Braun’s ”professional-grade” beard trimmer for the home set, with a quick and secure front control dial to change cut length, long battery life, and an excellent-quality main clipper attachment. Other attachments of equal quality allow tight detail work, or ruler-straight lines and edgework. It is, in short, our favorite overall beard trimmer—and it’s handsomely on sale. —Matthew Korfhage If you love the idea of a multi-tool system like the Dyson AirWrap but can’t stomach shelling out $600, the Shark FlexStyle (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is for you. Like the AirWrap, there are two sets, one for “straight and wavy” and one for “curly and coily,” and both come with two brushes for drying and two barrels for curling. The wand bends at the middle to become a hair dryer that can be used alone or in concert with one of the brush attachments, and it even has one more heat setting than the Dyson—all for literally half the price. WIRED contributor Alanna Martine Kilkeary declared it the Best Multitasking Curler, while former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano deemed it a “near-perfect dupe” of the AirWrap. —Kat Merck Some people (like me) have stubborn hair that will only straighten with a flat iron, but others with more forgiving hair have a wider breadth of options, from hot brushes to air-assisted tools like Dyson’s AirWrap (8/10 WIRED Recommends). Yet another method is via the Tymo Ring, a straightening comb that former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano called in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners a way to take “the curl right out quickly—I didn't have to go over sections more than once or twice.” She also liked the outer shell that covers the hot teeth, so users are able to get closer to their roots without burning themselves. —Kat Merck As detailed in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, this OG Chi is an oldie but a goodie—even though it’s got ceramic plates and only heats up to 392 degrees Fahrenheit, it’s able to successfully smooth a broad range of hair types and textures. It’s lightweight, with 1-inch plates for easy maneuverability and waves, plus it’s got three heat settings and one-hour auto-shutoff for safety. I had one of these straighteners decades ago and it lasted nearly 10 years. Even though this isn’t the greatest sale I’ve ever seen, I still wouldn’t hesitate to buy it again. —Kat Merck This mascara has been my holy grail for years. There are a few drugstore dupes that come close, but in my opinion, nothing beats the real thing. It makes my lashes look long, thick, and velvety in just one coat, and in two coats I might as well be wearing falsies. I also appreciate just how deep and dark the black color is. If you want the most dramatic lashes of your life, this is the way. —Louryn Strampe If you’re looking for an alternative to a blow-dryer brush, the GHD Duet Style is a blow-dryer and flat iron combo that former WIRED contributor Victoria Woollaston-Webber thought worked just as well as the Dyson Airstrait (8/10, WIRED Recommends). Hot air vents through the device’s plates dry hair as it straightens for less damage overall, according to GHD. In our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, Victoria said she especially liked that the Shine Shot Mode could turn off the air and convert it to a traditional hair straightener. —Kat Merck I'm obsessed with blow-dry brushes. The Dyson got me hooked, but I've been pretty darn impressed with the T3 AireBrush on my post-shower hair. I've tried both the round and oval versions, and while I prefer the smaller round option for my chin-length bob, the oval works fantastic too for longer hair or if you like the blowout shape you’d get using a regular hairbrush. Either one is a great purchase, and both are 30 percent off for T3's sale. —Nena Farrell If you know, you know. Aquaphor is like magic. I use it on cracked cuticles, chapped lips, healing tattoos, dry knees, and even on my eyelids when I’m doing a glossy makeup look. This set comes with a travel-friendly 1.7-ounce tube as well as a giant 14-ounce tub. It should be enough to last you through this winter and next, and if you buy it frequently, this is a good deal. —Louryn Strampe With winter around the corner, your lips might start to feel more chapped than usual. This lip mask will help with that. The thick texture melts quickly and sinks straight into your dry skin, leaving your lips feeling less cracked. It also lasts long enough throughout the day that you won't have to constantly reapply the product—so the jar, while small, should last you for a while. —Brenda Stolyar Manscaped is best known for its viral below-the-belt Lawn Mower model. But above the neck, Manscaped’s Beard Hedger has its merits. Specifically, it sports a waterproof body, it’s great for a stubble trim, and its USB-C charger means you can charge it from your phone adapter or laptop. While the Hedger’s design may not be as elegant as some, this all adds up to make it a great travel device. —Matthew Korfhage Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This might just be the most incredible value of 2024. The Moto G Power 5G already impressed me (8/10, WIRED Recommends) earlier this year with its solid performance and 120-Hz LCD screen, not to mention the support for NFC to make contactless payments and even wireless charging. At this $200 discount, it’s a shockingly good Android phone, though its biggest flaw is that it will only receive an update to Android 15, and that’s it. You’ll still get two more years of security updates though. —Julian Chokkattu Flip phones are all the rage. These folding phones work like normal smartphones, but you can fold them in half to stow them in a pocket or purse. What’s not to love? Well, battery life isn’t great (you can just barely eke out a day with average use), but they’re cute and fun, plus Samsung’s build quality is exceptional (7/10, WIRED Recommends). The Galaxy Z Flip6’s external screen isn’t as useful as the cover screen on Motorola’s Razr+, but this is still a well-built flip phone at a reasonable price. —Julian Chokkattu Want a booklike folding phone? My top pick is the Google Pixel 9 Pro, but Samsung’s new Galaxy Z Fold6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is even cheaper! It has excellent build quality (Samsung has been doing this for six years after all), and the external display is wider than before, making it nicer to use. The cameras are great and the screens are bright, though it doesn’t open up to as large a screen as the Pixel. —Julian Chokkattu If, like me, you've been chasing the feeling of using your Blackberry Curve for over a decade now, then I have the accessory for you. It's called the Clicks Keyboard case (8/10, WIRED Recommends) and it's the first-of-its-kind iPhone case with a built-in keyboard. It's a great option for someone who relies on their phone for tasks like sending off emails, typing up documents, responding to Slack messages, and more. It'll take a while to get used to the tactile keys though—days or weeks depending on how quickly you build up muscle memory. We also only recommend it for the iPhone 16 lineup. It comes with a redesigned keyboard, a slightly more durable design, and support for MagSafe and CarPlay. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Series 10 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the latest model to join Apple's lineup. It also holds the top spot in our guide to the Best Apple Watches. Compared to its predecessor, it not only has a bigger display, but it's also thinner, lighter, and packs support for fast charging. The smartwatch also runs WatchOS 11, so you'll have access to features like Vitals (to check your baseline every morning) and Training Load (to see how your workouts are impacting your fitness over time). It's worth noting that it doesn't pack a blood oxygen sensor, though. —Brenda Stolyar The Ultra 2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our top pick for outdoor sports. Under the hood is an S9 chip for faster performance and an ultra-wideband chip with enhanced precision finding. You'll also have access to dual-frequency GPS, offline maps (that you'll have to download to your iPhone), and Backtrack for creating virtual breadcrumb trails on the Compass app via the Action button. —Brenda Stolyar The best running watch will probably always be a Garmin Forerunner. The line ranges from the barebones Forerunner 55 to the spendy Forerunner 965 for triathlons, but I think the Forerunner 165 has pretty much everything you need. The more you spend, the more sensors you get, and the Forerunner 165 has blood oxygen sensing plus a barometric altimeter, compass, and ambient light sensor, in addition to the now-standard fall detection and multiple satellite positioning systems. —Adrienne So Yes, the price is lower now that the new Oura Ring 4 has been released. But I wore the Oura Ring Gen3 for many years and found it to be accurate, attractive, and comfortable (once all the features it had promised in 2021 became available). Some days, I even find myself missing the three little bump optical sensors on the back of my ring. This is a pretty remarkable deal for a one-of-a-kind fitness tracker that started a whole product category all by itself. —Adrienne So There are a few pretty great Fitbit deals going on right now, but if you have kids, I suggest going for the Fitbit Ace LTE. Unlike the Apple Watch, it’s not phone-specific, so your kid can use it even if you and your spouse are an Android/iPhone family (if so, why?). It has a ton of fun, movement-based games that are an incentive for your kid to actually remember to charge your watch and keep it on. I understand that feelings are mixed on giving kids smart devices, but it helps us all keep track of each other as my kids walk around the neighborhood and it stops me from having to text everyone else’s parents all the time. —Adrienne So Samsung tried to make a squircle-shaped Apple Watch Ultra competitor and it’s … OK (7/10, WIRED Review). The company also targeted Apple-like pricing, but the Galaxy Watch Ultra didn’t have complete feature parity and its software isn’t as polished. Still, this is a powerful smartwatch with a few extra features over the company’s standard Galaxy Watch7, and it’s much more reasonably priced with this discount, which ends on December 1. —Julian Chokkattu The latest iteration of Samsung’s Galaxy Watch series has some artificial intelligence algorithms to improve your health tracking data, like giving you a comprehensive Energy Score and updated sleep tracking abilities. It can also detect if you have sleep apnea. However, editor Julian Chokkattu found battery life frustrating compared to older models, and it’s worth noting you won’t get the full functionality unless you pair it with a Samsung phone. —Adrienne So The OnePlus Watch 2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) had one job: stand out from other Wear OS smartwatches, and it succeeded. Unlike Samsung’s Galaxy Watch7 or Google’s Pixel Watch 3, OnePlus prioritized battery life over all else, and thanks to a clever dual-processor and dual-operating system hybrid architecture, the Watch 2 can last roughly three days on a single charge. Hooray! The health tracking isn’t its strong suit, but this is a Wear OS smartwatch so you’ll find many rich smart features, though it’s only compatible with Android phones. You can save even more by going with the OnePlus Watch 2R for $170 ($60 off), which has a screen that doesn’t get as bright, no sapphire crystal coating over the glass, and an aluminum build over stainless steel. —Julian Chokkattu This is still the watch that I would wear if I didn’t have to test other fitness trackers—and I’m not the only one, because Garmin’s Instinct line is one of the company’s most popular. It has all the backcountry capabilities of the higher-end Fenix and Epix lines, but it’s more affordable because it ditches the fancy screen. The Instinct 2 Solar’s battery life lasted almost three weeks when I tested it in Hawaii, where I used it to keep track of everything from trail runs to keeping me oriented toward the beach when snorkeling. —Adrienne So The Fitbit Charge 6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) tops our guide to the best fitness trackers thanks to the perfect balance of attractiveness, affordability, accessibility, and ease of use. Google’s takeover has led to several smart integrations with Google Maps, Google Wallet, and YouTube Music Premium. This tracker can keep tabs on your skin temperature, 24/7 heart rate, activities, and sleep schedule. You can also expect week-long battery life, but the best features still require the $10/month Fitbit Premium subscription. —Simon Hill Garmin recently combined its two high-end Epix and Fenix lines in the updated Fenix 8 series, which we will be including in our Best Fitness Trackers roundup. However, if you have no particular need for voice commands or new, leakproof buttons for scuba, the second-gen Epix Pro is still a great buy, and it’s now much cheaper! Use the beautiful AMOLED screen to access Garmin’s detailed proprietary maps. And I’m a little embarrassed by how much I like the onboard flashlight. —Adrienne So Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This isn't technically a deal, but retailers are currently offering Batman: Arkham Shadow and three months of Meta Quest+, its game subscription program, through April 2025. If you've never tried a VR headset and you're curious, this is one of the best and easiest ways to start playing loads of games to see if you like it. We also think the Quest 3S is one of the cheapest and lightest ways to get into gaming (it will still make you slightly nauseous if you're not used to it, though.) —Adrienne So This is our top gaming headset recommendation because it uses Logitech’s Lightspeed connection system (with a 2.4-GHz dongle) for low-latency audio (important when playing fast-paced games). You can also use Bluetooth if you’d like, or jack in with the 3.5-mm headphone jack. That makes it more versatile than ever. The boom mic arm is detachable so you can wear this out of the house without feeling like you’re headed to a call center. Our previous top pick was the G Pro X 2’s predecessor, and it’s also on sale for $81 ($19 off). But that one’s a wired headset so you have fewer connectivity options. —Julian Chokkattu As the younger sibling to the impressive HyperX Cloud Alpha, these boast an incredible 120 hours of claimed battery life, in some cases four times its competitors. That truly astounding number is backed up by crisp sound quality and a high level of compatibility. The included USB-C dongle and USB-A adapter let you plug them into almost any system you can find, so nothing will stand between you and your games, particularly having to recharge. —Brad Bourque The PlayStation VR2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the best VR headsets, featuring a comfortable, adjustable headband, excellent eye-tracking that allows you to select menu items or track objects by looking at them, and it comes with two controllers. If you crave immersion, you’ll find it here. The headset requires a PS5 and this is a tasty discount, but we recommend going for the PlayStation VR2 Horizon Call of The Mountain Bundle ($349) since it is the same price and includes one of the best PS VR2 games in Horizon Call of the Mountain. —Simon Hill Our favorite gaming headset for multi-platform gamers, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X supports almost every modern system under the sun, including the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and basically anything else with a USB-C port or Bluetooth. It’s also super comfortable for long gaming sessions, with plush ear cups and the classic SteelSeries support band. At just $100, these very well might be your favorite new pair of wireless gaming headphones. —Brad Bourque The PlayStation 5 Slim is a slimmed-down version of the PlayStation 5 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) that’s around 30 percent slimmer. It runs the same list of great PS5 games but takes up less space beneath the TV. We have a breakdown of the different PlayStation 5 models if you want to dive deeper, but the PS5 Slim is the only one on sale and a 15 percent discount is decent if you’re in the market for a Sony console. —Simon Hill Even at its full price of $40, the Logitech G203 feels like a solid deal, but for half that, it’s a downright steal. It has six programmable buttons, full support for the Logitech G Hub software, and RGB lighting—what else could you ask for? The only real compromise here is the 8,000 DPI max, but as long as you can live with that, this is a great budget-friendly gaming mouse or a perfect backup mouse for traveling or emergencies. —Brad Bourque Compact gaming keyboards like the Razer Huntsman Mini make a lot of sense for gamers with limited desk space. As long as you can live without a num pad or arrow keys, you’ll find all the features you’d expect from a full size offering in this compact keyboard. That includes Razer’s excellent software support, keycap compatibility, and excellent build quality. All that adds up to a big deal on a small board, and it’s just part of the reason the Razer Huntsman Mini is our favorite small keyboard. —Brad Bourque With a million mechanical keyboards on the market, it can be tough to stand out, but the Corsair K100 does just that with its built-in control wheel. This programmable knob can adjust keyboard lighting or other built-in keyboard functions, but more fun is the option to set it to control media playback on your system. You’ll also get RGB backlighting, a volume control wheel, and a set of macro keys along the left side, all features we’d expect from a mechanical keyboard at this price point. —Brad Bourque The Steam Deck might be all about portable handheld gaming, but sometimes you just wanna plug it into a bigger screen, just like a Nintendo Switch, especially if you want to play a game with a keyboard and mouse. This aluminum Jsaux 7-in-1 Steam Deck Dock will do the job, with three USB-A ports, a DisplayPort, an HDMI, a USB-C, and even an Ethernet port. —Julian Chokkattu I didn’t think I’d love Disney Dreamlight Valley when I first installed it, but it quickly became one of my favorite cozy games. It’s fantastic on the Nintendo Switch but available for other consoles. It’s a life sim where you’ll run around collecting items, farming crops, fishing, and decorating, but it also has a surprisingly grown-up storyline that might entice even those of us who don’t have fond memories of Disney movies or shows. The Cozy Edition comes with bonus cosmetics that you don’t get with the base game. Pro tip: Plant all the pumpkins. —Louryn Strampe It’s always nice to see a solid deal on our favorite keyboard. The Logitech G Pro X TKL Lightspeed might have a mouthful of a name, but it’s as streamlined and stylish as they come. It sports bright backlit keys with your standard RGB setup, wireless connectivity, and a minimal, high quality design that fits right in on any desk. Beyond media controls and some buttons for functionality, the G Pro X TKL packs just the right features, and leaves the rest on the cutting room floor, which is why we like it. —Brad Bourque If you’re looking for a simple joystick for gaming, it’s hard to beat the value on the Logitech G Extreme 3D Pro USB Joystick. It isn’t the fanciest, and its plastic construction won’t impress true enthusiasts, but you’ll spend two or three times the price to get anything similar from a manufacturer as reputable as Logitech. It also sports a huge number of buttons, both on the handle and on the base, and a throttle slider that’s not as common on joysticks at this price point. That makes it the perfect joystick for a quick flight in Microsoft Flight Simulator or a few hours of space trucking in Elite Dangerous. —Brad Bourque The hardest console gamers know that quick reactions can be the difference between total glory and complete failure, so give yourself every advantage with the SCUFInstinct Pro controller for Xbox. This upgraded controller features improved materials for grip and comfort, plus a more premium build quality, but the best part is hidden around back. Four programmable paddles allow you to put your most important buttons right at your fingertips for lightning-fast access, giving you the ultimate edge against anyone who has to move their hand to hit the melee button. —Brad Bourque Our favorite USB microphone is sporting a decent discount, as it is fairly often. The Blue Yeti has a long history on the desks of streamers and podcasters, and for good reason. It sports solid audio performance, great build quality, and easy access to controls. That makes it a great option for anyone looking to upgrade from their gaming headset’s microphone, or to pair with some better headphones. —Brad Bourque This Intel Core i7-14700K 8-Core 5.6 GHz (LGA 1700 Socket) chip is a very solid performer and will work with any 700-series chipset-based motherboard. It'll get you through heavy workday tasks like video editing with ease and can handle 4K gaming. —Scott Gilbertson This is one of the best game controllers for PC gamers, with five central buttons on the front, a pair of rear paddles, and plenty of customization options. 8BitDo’s software lets you remap buttons, tweak the stick and trigger sensitivity, assign macros, and tune the vibration intensity. It’s compact with a grippy texture on the handles, satisfyingly clicky triggers, and a decent D-pad. There’s a 2.4G dongle in the handy charging dock for PC gaming, and battery life is around 20 hours. It also has Bluetooth support for Nintendo Switch players, making this a solid alternative to the Switch Pro controller. —Simon Hill Feel free to take $40 off the reasonably equipped Gigabyte B650, a mid-range AMD Ryzen motherboard with support for DDR5 RAM, 2.5Gbps Ethernet, and USB 3.2 Gen 2x2. While it isn’t the highest-end offering, notably missing PCIe 5.0, it still supports overclocking, and even has built-in Wi-Fi for easy connectivity. Make sure to check out our PC building guide for more info on what you should be looking for when purchasing a motherboard. —Brad Bourque Western Digital also makes excellent SSDs, and this one is no exception. The SN 770 M.2 2280 achieved speeds of 5,100 Mbps in my testing, which is blazing fast. If you're doing a lot of drive-intensive tasks, like editing video or gaming, this drive is well worth the money. The largest version you can get is 2 TB, but the price is reasonable considering the speed increase. —Scott Gilbertson Viture's Pro XR Glasses make for a great portable gaming display you can take anywhere. They have a large, virtual screen (135 inches), a smooth 120-Hz frame rate, and a maximum brightness of 4,000 nits. The company has done a solid job with the software too and tailored the experience for gamers. You can also, however, use these for watching movies or multitasking work. However, it's worth noting the Harman-tuned speakers are limited. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This LifeStraw has been featured in many an iteration of our outdoorsy gift guide (though we’ve replaced it this year). Nevertheless, it’s a good product. This LifeStraw can screw onto a plastic water bottle or be used as a straw to slurp up water from basically anywhere. It filters out at least 99.99 percent of bacteria, microplastics, and other gross contaminants. If you’re shopping for a prepper this holiday season, or you’re just like me and ill-prepared for the zombie apocalypse, this deal is worth checking out. —Louryn Strampe The Leatherman Wave+ is our top pick multi-tool. The tools flip out and retract with just the right mix of smoothness and tension, and the mix of tools here is very useful—two stainless steel knives, one with a straight edge and the other serrated, along with 16 other tools, including a wood-and-metal file, a diamond-coated file, a saw, Phillips screwdriver bits, scissors, an 8-inch ruler, and a wire stripper, as well as a bottle and can opener. The Branwyn bra is in our essential guide to merino wool, but I like it enough that I wrote a whole separate rave about it. Merino wool is a miracle fiber—it’s renewable, odor-resistant, regulates your temperature and doesn’t leave you with a terminal case of swamp booty should you choose to jump in a river with your hiking clothes on. What’s not to like? Everything at Branwyn is 25 percent off through December 3 (just add to your basket to see the discount). —Adrienne So I love my pellet smoker for cooking everything from meat to pizza—as does WIRED reviewer Scott Gilbertson in our guide to the Best Grills—which is why I highly recommend this Traeger. It can connect to Wi-Fi for easy monitoring of longer cooks, and features the classic easy-to-clean Traeger design that made the brand an icon in the first place. —Parker Hall The Breeo is the most overbuilt option on our best fire pits guide and wins our favor by opening the door to a complete ecosystem of products including a live-fire pizza oven and a flat-top grill for making smashburgers. This is a sizable sale on the pit. —Martin Cizmar Like the Coleman above, the RoadTrip 225 allows you to use only one burner, so you can grill a couple of burgers without draining your propane tank. With variable controls, you can sear veggies on one side while cooking meat more slowly on the other. There's a grease pan to catch drips while cooking, and it's removable for cleaning. You also get push-button ignition and 11,000 BTUs of propane grilling power. At this price, it's hard to beat these features. —Louryn Strampe Cupping therapy can be intimidating, but the TheraCup makes bringing spa-level treatment at home easy. It blends suction, heat, and vibration to mimic the effects of traditional cupping therapy. I’ve found it user-friendly, and with its auto-shutoff and safety sensors, I don’t have to worry about overdoing it. At $129 ($20 off), it’s a solid investment that will save you from splurging on professional sessions. —Boutayna Chokrane If you’re tired of itchy or sweaty socks, these Carhartts are a solid upgrade. WIRED’s self-proclaimed sock-hating outdoorsman, Scott Gilbertson, is living proof that these socks can convert even the most dedicated barefooters. He’d rather brave the snow wearing a pair of sandals; that is, until he was gifted the Carhartt Midweight Merino Wool Blend Crew Socks. These woolies are designed to keep your feet warm, dry, and odor-free—even after a full day of hiking. The midweight design strikes the ideal balance between breathability and insulation, perfect for year-round excursions. —Boutayna Chokrane The LifePro Sonic Massage Gun proves you don’t need to spend a fortune for a deep-tissue massage. With eight included attachments—yes, eight—it’s the most versatile massager we’ve tried. It’s more than capable of working even the most stubborn knots, and with five intensity levels, don’t worry about whether it packs a punch. —Boutayna Chokrane The PowerDot 2.0 Muscle Stimulator is a recent addition to my recovery routine. It pairs with your smartphone to provide personalized muscle recovery and strength training, and ease menstrual cramps. When I first tried it, I expected a sharp zap, but the sensation was surprisingly soothing, like a prickly, customizable massage. The Duo is ideal for multiple or larger areas, and it comes with everything you need: electrode pads, lead cables, a charger, and a carrying case. Note: I’ve encountered some connectivity hiccups with the app, and online reviews suggest I’m not alone. Still, when it works, it’s brilliant. —Boutayna Chokrane Niu’s scooters have long been reliable for me, with simple folding mechanisms and a comfy riding experience. That continues with the KQi 300X, a 49-pound escooter with 10.5-inch tubeless tires, regenerative braking, and a 16-mile range in my tests (I’m 6’4”, so you can probably go even further.) This one has turn signals too, though they are not time-based and need to be turned off manually. Still, this is one of the lower prices I’ve seen and great value. —Julian Chokkattu A sub-$3000 electric mountain bike is amazing, and Aventon’s version has incredible specs for the price point. Reviewer Steph Pearson was impressed by its smooth, consistent power. Its weight is a bit much (OK, it’s a lot) for technical singletrack, but if you have a commute that incorporates steep hills, dirt roads, or potholes, it’s the perfect ride.—Adrienne So If you just want something for quick trips to the grocery store or just puttering around your neighborhood, the Segway E2 Pro is probably more than enough. It’s affordable, even more so now with this deal, and the 350-watt motor does a decent job with small slopes. It’s 41 pounds, but you get tubeless tires, good brakes, and a 15-mph top speed. I usually managed a little under 10 miles. It’s also rare to see turn signals on an affordable scooter, which is a nice perk. Want to save even more? I’ve also tested the E2 Plus, which is now $280 ($70 off). It’s lighter and slower, but it does the job for short trips. —Julian Chokkattu I’ve now tested more than 50 pickleball paddles to make our guide to the best, but I have a soft spot for the SLK Evo, which was the first nice paddle I bought with my own money. It has a nice neutral feel and a great grip. You won’t be able to get much top spin off the fiberglass face, but it’s fine for anyone below the advanced level. —Martin Cizmar This inflatable hot tub is nice! The Coleman SaluSpa Ibiza (7/10, WIRED Review) is easy to set up and generally user-friendly. It takes a while to heat up, but when it’s rolling, it’s a great place to relax and unwind. The pump module has built-in cupholders and there are optional air jets to bubble away all of your worries. It’s got room for four to six people, though I think six would be a bit too cozy. Just make sure you have the space for it before purchasing. —Louryn Strampe Movement begets more movement! WIRED contributor Kristin Canning would have paid even full price for this walking pad. It feels good underfoot (she often walks on it wearing just socks), isn’t annoyingly loud, and doesn’t shake her standing desk. You can control it with both the remote or the app, and Canning prefers the app as the Bluetooth connectivity can get a bit wonky. —Adrienne So No one I know has ever regretted getting a walking pad. It helps even the least motivated of us get a little more movement into our day. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano noted that the Egofit is compact and easy to use and move. You can control it with a remote, and the digital screen displays time, calories burned, distance walked, steps, and walking speed (be warned, though, there is no pause button). —Adrienne So In our Smart Bird Feeders Buying Guide, we recommend this model as the prettiest, and we also like that it’s made with less plastic than other feeders. This bamboo Netvue Birdfy (6/10, WIRED Review) features an extendable perch and two large bins for bird seeds, and it includes a solar panel so you won’t need to charge or replace the batteries. The included 1080p camera will show you video feeds and pictures of bird visitors. You can pay more to get a lifetime subscription with AI that’ll help identify birds—though sometimes it gets it wrong. Note that, although it’s rot- and mold-resistant, it does need to be sealed with a bird-safe wood sealer. —Louryn Strampe This adorable stroller takes the features of a full-size stroller and packs them into a smaller package. The Thule Shine’s (9/10, WIRED Recommends) adjustable handlebar works for a huge variety of heights—both my 5’ mom and my 6'4" dad could comfortably push my son around in this stroller thanks to the five different height options, and the stroller can switch to do inward or outward facing and has accessories for car seats and a bassinet. It's one of my favorite full-sized strollers I've ever tried, and it's on sale for a nice discount. —Nena Farrell In our Best Treadmills roundup, WIRED contributor Kristin Canning notes that the incline ranges on the BowFlex Treadmill 22 are much greater than our top pick, the NordicTrack. That means it’s ideal for hill training, or if it’s dark and late outside and you can’t make yourself drive anywhere to prep for an upcoming road race. Bowflex has its own proprietary fitness programming with both on- and off-tread options, but you can also stream your own shows and movies, too. —Adrienne So Even if we weren’t always scaling rugged peaks, we used Rocky Talkies on almost every camping trip—you need a better way to talk to your family besides running around and yelling. Rocky Talkies have a few advantages over cheap walkies. They come with a carabiner to clip on your pack or clothes, so they don’t slide off; the battery life is much better, and it’s much easier to use. The push-to-talk button is even recessed so you don’t accidentally transmit your shit-talking. The waterproof mic and extra battery are also on sale. —Adrienne So We're huge fans of the Peloton Tread, it's actually one of the best home treadmills we've tested so far. It's sleek and beautiful, so it won't be an eyesore in your house and you'll have access to some of the most engaging fitness programming out there—complete with great music, top-tier instructors, and fun workouts. If you're more interested in one of the company's bikes, those are also on sale for up to $700. —Brenda Stolyar Jumping rope is one of the best ways to get an intense cardio workout without needing a lot of space, and Crossrope is one of the most fun ways to do it. It builds strength in the shoulders, forearms, and legs, and doing double-unders, crossovers, or other complicated steps is just fun. Subscribe to the app, get access to 2,500 workouts and over 35 different fitness programs, watch videos, and use your Bluetooth-connected jump rope to really show those CrossFitters what’s what. —Adrienne So Nothing can possibly fix you as much as cold plunges can, but devotees of the practice will tell you otherwise. Sun Home’s premium version is the only portable cold plunge tub that’s capable of getting to as low as 33 degrees, which you will need once you’ve acclimated to 40 degrees and need to get even colder to chase that euphoric high. It’s also sturdy, chills water quickly, and surprisingly, doesn’t add too much to your electricity bill.—Adrienne So Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals If you’re in the market for a travel bag, the Dagne Dover Petra Convertible Tote is a chameleon of carryalls. It’s part backpack, part tote, and even has a luggage pass-through that is a back-saver during long treks through airports. At nearly 17 inches tall, this bag is big, but it still fits under most airplane seats. We’re particularly fond of the padded compartments, offering extra protection for your tech gear and one less thing to worry about while rushing to your gate. —Boutayna Chokrane I love Calpak's clear cosmetic cases. They were viral for a reason, since it's easy to see where everything is thanks to the clear design, and the two separate sides make it easy to keep it from becoming a massive mess inside the bag. While the clear cases come in three sizes, only the largest size is on sale. WIRED editor Kat Merck didn’t find this case the easiest to travel with while reviewing it for the Best Toiletry Bags guide, but I use the medium-sized bag for my daily makeup. The large case is a great choice if you have a lot of makeup and skincare you're looking to easily store and keep organized. There are a couple colors that are 30 percent off, but most are 20 percent off, which is still a good deal. —Nena Farrell A carry-on is a highly personalized purchase—it’s both an accessory and one of the bags that endures the most abuse when you use it. Aer’s is more expensive than some of our other picks, but I particularly liked Aer’s for a few reasons. The polycarbonate surface doesn’t pick up dirt as easily as the Monos, and it doesn’t have ridges like the Beis. It also has specialized Hinamoto metal ball bearings for smoother rolling, as well as wheel locks, so it doesn’t slide all over the place when you have to take it on a shuttle. All of Aer’s luggage is 25 percent off through Dec. 2, but you’ll need to enter a SAVE20 discount code to get the deal. —Adrienne So Staying hydrated feels almost effortless with the Owala 40-ounce tumbler. We love Owalas for a few reasons: They’re free of BPA, lead, and phthalates, which should be a minimum standard for reusable water bottles. Owala’s trademark 2-in-1 lid makes this tumbler work with hot, cold, and carbonated beverages. And Owala’s limited-edition color palettes are dangerously addictive, making it hard not to grab one in every shade. So, if you’re eyeing a certain design, there’s no time like the present. —Boutayna Chokrane Several WIRED Gear team members use the Front-Range Harness. While I use the attachment point at the top behind my pup’s head, my colleague uses the bottom one, so if her dog Roux chases after a squirrel and pulls on the leash, he’ll just spin and face her. It has reflective strips for increased visibility and there’s padding for the undersides so they don’t dig in. They’re well-made and have held up after years of use. —Julian Chokkattu Some travel mugs dent if you so much as look at them wrong, but not the Hydro Flask. Its signature powder-coated exterior is as durable as it is sleek. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano has been using hers for years without a single ding, making it a reliable choice for your busiest days and clumsiest moments. Plus, no lead here—unlike certain other tumblers we know (looking at you, Stanley). —Boutayna Chokrane Editor Kat Merck is obsessed with the Dagne Dover Mila Toiletry Organizer, which she uses for her cosmetics. Made from recycled materials, it’s sustainable, water-resistant, and easy to clean. Merck especially loves the thoughtful compartments: the carabiner for jewelry, the zippered pouch for hair ties and bobby pins, and the elastic loops for makeup brushes. The sections can feel snug for more than two full-sized products but are perfect for travel-sized essentials. P.S., the small model is also on sale for $38. —Boutayna Chokrane An honorable mention in our guide to the Best Toiletry Bags, this toiletry kit is a decent option for those who want a simple, well-made bag that can either hang or lay flat. There’s a snap-in plastic envelope for soap or a toothbrush, and the navy version I tested is made from recycled bottles. I wasn’t especially impressed with the bag’s organizational components in comparison to its size, and I didn’t like that the bag’s thick, small plastic hook couldn’t hang on a towel rack, but otherwise, I had no major complaints during my weeks of testing. It should also be noted this bag comes in almost 20 different colors and prints, from metallic pink to a basketball motif, so at this price it would make a great gift for adults and kids alike. —Kat Merck The Travelrest Nest Ultimate Travel Pillow (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is nearly perfect. The back is flat, which keeps your spine aligned, whereas the sides and front are high and firm, which keeps your neck supported. The microfiber cover is soft and machine washable, and the memory foam cover holds its shape without compressing too much. We just wish the stuff sack had an attachment point for easier toting around. —Louryn Strampe Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Our favorite mirrorless camera, Sony's A7 IV (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is a 33-megapixel, full-frame camera capable of incredibly sharp images, with excellent dynamic range and great autofocus, and it's smaller than most of its competitors. There's five-axis image stabilization built-in, and it can shoot 7K oversampled 4K/30 fps video. —Scott Gilbertson The A7R V is the highest-resolution stills camera on the market (unless you opt for medium-format cameras). If that's not enough, there's a 16-shot, high-resolution mode that can create 240-MP images (so long as your subject is static, e.g., a landscape). The dynamic range is outstanding, and the autofocus speeds and smarts are some of the best we've seen. The only down side is the file size; fully uncompressed RAW files from this sensor run around 125 megabytes per image, though there are compressed options that will get them down to about 80 MP per image. —Scott Gilbertson GoPro's new Hero 13 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a fantastic action camera. The Hero 13 features a new interchangeable lens system, with Macro, Ultra Wide, and Anamorphic lenses, plus a set of four neutral density filters (all sold separately). The Hero 13 Black even autodetects which lens is attached and changes settings accordingly. It's a slick, if expensive, system, but this deal at least saves you some cash on the base camera, which you can put toward an extra lens. Except the Anamorphic, which won't be available until 2025. —Scott Gilbertson This deal has been running since the new Hero 13 Black launched earlier this year, and if you have the extra $40 to spare, I highly recommend the Hero 13 over the 12. But if you're on a tight budget, or just don't have any interest in the interchangeable lenses, the Hero 12 uses the same sensor and makes a great action cam. —Scott Gilbertson The DJI Air 3 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) remains one of our favorite drones, despite the brand new Air 3S. The new Air 3S brings larger sensors, which do improve the video a bit, but the Air 3 is still a fantastic dual-camera drone and, at this price, a better value than the new Air 3S. —Scott Gilbertson The Osmo Action 4 has been surpassed by the new Osmo Action 5, but the Action 4 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is still a fantastic action camera, especially at this price. The magnetic mounting system is great, the menu system makes switching between modes a snap, and the resulting photos and video are excellent. —Scott Gilbertson Insta360's Ace Pro was just replaced by the new Ace Pro 2, but this is a good deal on what is still a great camera. Capable of recording up to 8K 24 fps, with solid stabilization, good color handling, and a Leica lens to boot, there's a lot to love here, especially for only $300. That said, unless you think you're going to use the 8K (which is really only usable in still shots, not action footage), the Osmo Action 4 deal above is a better value. —Scott Gilbertson Our favorite 360 camera, Insta360's X4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends), features a 1/2-inch sensor capable of 8K video, which is as high-resolution as you can get in a 360-degree camera. The 8K resolution means you can reframe your footage to fit rectangular video formats and still have high-quality clips sharp enough to mix with other sources. It doesn’t reframe to 4K (you'll have to wait for 12K footage before that's possible), but it's good enough for anything you'd put on social media. —Scott Gilbertson The Insta360 Go 3S (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is just plain fun. It's a hybrid camera that transforms from a traditional action-camera form factor to a more portable go-anywhere wearable camera. In action camera mode, it's much like the Ace Pro above. The sensor isn't as big so the image quality isn't as good, but you get the flip-up rear screen. The camera itself is waterproof to 33 feet (10 meters). The case can also continue to act as a remote monitor even when you pull the camera out. Couple that with the extremely strong magnetic mounting system on the camera pod, and the Go 3 becomes capable of shots and angles that no other action camera can match. —Scott Gilbertson If you want an instant camera and don't want to spend a lot, the Instax Mini 12 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is your best bet. It's a capable, easy-to-use camera wrapped in a colorful, bubbly design. One thing you'll find here that's missing even on more expensive models is parallax correction. That means you don't have to guess where the center of the frame is for close-up subjects. What you see is what you get, eliminating those accidentally ill-framed close-ups that sometimes happen with other instant cameras. —Scott Gilbertson The Sprocket Photo Printer offers the best results of the ink mini printers we've tested. It's roughly the size of a phone and connects with iPhone, iPad, or Android phones via Bluetooth. The mobile app lets you edit and customize your photos before printing. There's also an option to tile your images onto multiple prints for a larger, pieced-together image. —Scott Gilbertson The Polaroid Now+ has the typical features you'd expect from a Polaroid: vintage aesthetics, roll-out film, and a nice chunky body with easy-to-find buttons. What sets it apart is the smartphone companion app, which gives you the option to use features like Tripod Mode, Manual Mode, or setting a custom f-stop in Aperture Priority Mode. The Now+ also lets you take double exposures. It's pricey but it offers a good blend of modern methods and vintage execution. —Scott Gilbertson The Flir One Gen 3 is the largest of the thermal cameras we've tested. It’s about 2.6 inches wide and 1.3 inches tall, and it fits a lot into that space, including a built-in battery and two cameras. The first is the IF camera which captures 80 x 60-pixel images and then combines them with the second camera, which grabs a higher resolution image of visible light, which the device smooths and scales up to a nice, pretty clear, 1,440 x 1,080-pixel image. —Scott Gilbertson Our favorite place to print photos is having a 30 percent off sale on its print services. Mpix makes high-quality prints at a reasonable price even when it's full price, which makes this a great deal. Mpix prints on Kodak Endura paper and offers a variety of paper options. I tested the E-surface, which renders rich, deep blacks and true-to-life colors. It holds up well over time; the images we printed in 2013 look exactly like they did when we got them. We also like Mpix's books and calendars. —Scott Gilbertson If you need to print gifts for your family, Shutterfly is having a sitewide 50 percent off sale. We're fans of Shutterfly's book printing service, which had the best results so far in our testing of photo printing services. We also like the calendars. The printing is good enough, especially for the price, and shipping is generally speedy. —Scott Gilbertson

When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more Update: Cyber Monday may be over now, but many stores will slide into 'Cyber Week' to ride out the holiday deals event a little longer. We've been highlighting deals below since before Black Friday last week. Many will be expiring as we speak, but it's worth a quick look as some could continue on for a few more days. Original article follows: The S90D is our favorite 2024 TV overall. Its QD-OLED panel delivers a high-contrast image with vivid colors, wide viewing angles, and impressive brightness for this class. The U6N is one of the top budget TVs available. The 4K QLED display uses quantum dots, local dimming, and a Mini LED backlight to deliver higher contrast and a wider range of colors than most competitors in its class. The C4 is LG's latest midrange 4K OLED TV. It carries over everything we loved about last year's C3 while offering a slight increase in brightness and support for a faster 144Hz refresh rate with a PC. Samsung's Frame TV can be mounted flush against your wall like a hanging piece of art. It also features a matte screen to make it look more like canvas, and you can purchase optional magnetic frame bezels in different colors and designs. This 100-inch TV is a whopping size that will allow you to catch every inch of every game. With up to 800 nits of HDR brightness, local dimming, and a fast 144Hz refresh rate, this is one of the best values there is at this size. TCL's S5 LED display doesn't use quantum dots like the brand's pricier QLED TVs, but it's still capable of wide color support and it uses the Amazon Fire TV OS for easy integration with Alexa. The TCL QM7 is an impressive midrange QLED TV. Its Mini LED contrast performance, high brightness, and 144Hz gaming capabilities are nearly unrivaled at this price range. The B4 is LG's entry-level OLED TV. Though it can't get as bright as pricier models, it still offers an infinite contrast which makes it a great budget OLED for watching movies in a dark room. TCL's S5 is one of the brand's entry-level 4K TVs. Brightness and contrast are limited compared to pricier models, but the S5 still offers a wide range of colors and has Alexa built-in. This 720p TV comes with Alexa Voice Remote capabilities, so you can easily search across apps, switch inputs, and much more using your voice — no clunky remotes and tedious typing necessary. We only recommend it if you can find it on sale, though. Paramount Plus offers a huge library of on-demand content from Paramount, CBS, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, and MTV. The Premium Plan also includes Showtime and live CBS streaming. It costs $12.99 a month or $120 a year. For the next two months, though, you get this tier for just $2.99 a month, which is a great opportunity to make your way through a few shows with no irritating ads - of which there are many on the ad-supported tier. Paramount Plus is perfect for viewers who want to stream CBS TV shows, local NFL games, and tons of content from Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, and MTV. And if you get the premium tier you can also unlock ad-free streaming and access to Showtime. A new promotion sees the monthly fee knocked down to $2.99 for a couple of months. There's a huge double-saving on these two bundled popular ad-supported streaming platforms as this price lasts for 12 months. If you subscribe to these two individually, they're $9.99 a month each. Outside of Cyber Monday, this already-discounted Duo package would be $10.99, but less than a cup of coffee a month for the next year is unbeatable value. Offer expires December 2. Hulu is an excellent choice for cord-cutters thanks to a mix of exclusive titles and next-day streaming for popular network shows. The ad-supported tier is usually $9.99 a month, but the epic Cyber Monday deal has returned, lowering those monthly fee prices to just 99 cents for a year. We'd spend an extra couple of bucks and get it bundled with Disney Plus, though. Both offers expire December 2. Peacock is a convenient streaming source for hit NBC TV shows, Universal movies, and select sports like Sunday Night Football. The service also carries its own slate of original programming. The annual version of Peacock's ad-supported tier is an absolute steal right now, with a major Cyber Monday discount getting you a whole year of access for just $19.99. That's plenty of time to enjoy a rich collection of sitcoms, movies, and live events. Offer expires December 2. The Starz streaming service offers several original shows and classic movies. The semi-annual plan is a steal compared to a standard month-to-month subscription. Fubo is the streaming service for sports fans. Its huge library of channels includes regional and international sports leagues, setting it apart from the competition. You can also tack on additional programming to your plan, but it'll cost you extra. The Leesa Sapira Hybrid Mattress provides great edge support and motion isolation. Its mix of memory foam and pocket springs produces an average firmness, making it an outstanding solution for back pain sufferers of any sleeping style. Save an extra $25 with our exclusive promo code INSIDER25. The Saatva Classic Mattress is designed to suit a variety of sleeping styles and features a plush top for luxurious comfort. The DreamCloud Premier Hybrid Mattress performed well in all of our tests, which makes it ideal for most sleeping types, couples, and people who tend to overheat at night. Casper has redesigned its classic hybrid mattress into the Dream, which offers a medium-firm feel that sleeps cool and has zone support. While we haven't tested it yet, the Nectar Premier is designed to be a step up in comfort from the Classic, which we love. At under $1,000, it's the brand's most popular model. The gel memory foam of the Nectar makes it a versatile mattress that conforms to the contours of your body to relieve pressure. It's a premium sleep experience, but its price tag is way under a grand. The memory foam of the Bear mattress, combined with Celliant technology, makes this a great bed for active folks looking for some rest and recovery. Apply code BFCM4TY to save 40% off at checkout, and get free pillows, instead of the automatically applied deal. The Big Fig Mattress is constructed for heavier individuals with firm support and a high weight capacity. The Tempur-Pedic Cloud Mattress features contouring foam that cradles sleepers of all body types and sleeping styles while offering outstanding pressure relief and heat dissipation. The Scuba is a crowd-favorite style from lululemon, and this version has a roomy, oversized fit alongside the style's signature fleecy fabric. This simple knit is made with a blend of recycled and virgin cashmere. It comes in five colorways. "Jenni Kayne's cashmere sweaters are a splurge for sure, but this one is the best luxury-grade cardigan I've tried," writes associate style editor Gabrielle Chase. “Upon feeling the soft material, I knew that the piece was quality and would hold up after more than just a few wears and washes,” says freelance reporter Olivia Rose Rushing. “I was surprised at just how comfy it was — especially since I was able to adjust the shoulder straps to my liking.” This pushup bra uses a super-soft sheen microfiber fabric with extra-compressive side wings for a smoothing effect. It’s designed to be invisible under clothing. Featuring a sumptuous sherpa collar, an asymmetrical closure, and a soft leather construction, this trend-forward jacket will keep you warm all season long, sans sacrificing style. With 700-fill power, responsibly-sourced goose down, a water-repellent and wind-resistant fabric, and a removable hood, this cropped puffer will keep you warm all through winter. It comes in 11 colors. “I’ve been buying Abercrombie & Fitch winter coats for years, and I’ve never been disappointed in a purchase," says freelance writer Talia Ergas. "The Ultra Puffer turned out to be everything I hoped for. The puffiness is balanced nicely by the short silhouette and luxurious faux fur accents. I also love that the bottom hem is elastic, so it hugs my hips and keeps the cold out.” This soft, smooth raschel fleece jacket is lightweight and insulating. Plus, it's made from 100% recycled materials. There’s no time like the present to layer up in a seriously cozy flannel shirt jacket. Complete with a quilted lining, it’s a perfectly rugged layer atop a thermal shirt on brisk winter mornings. Turn back the clock with this throwback rugby shirt, a Ralph Lauren staple for decades that looks as great now as it did back in the day. This cozy knit is a versatile layering piece thanks to its breathable cotton construction. While it’s a men’s sweater, many of our female editors found the sizing to be perfectly oversized for all shapes, sizes, and genders. This jacket feels like a plush fleece but is still thin enough for winter layering. It comes in several different color options, from navy to green or brown. This effortlessly cool mini skirt stands out for its functional cargo pockets and stretchy cotton moleskin fabric—and it looks equally great paired with a graphic tee or sweater as it does with a blouse and tights. These size-inclusive jeans are available in petite and tall lengths and have an extra two inches in the hips to create an easy-going, flattering fit. While some styles of Bonobos’ classic chinos aren’t on sale, these refined brushed twill chinos in a range of seasonal colors are up for grabs. They also come with Bonobos’ eye-catching lined pockets for a colorful touch of flair. Wear these medium-compression shorts under your ensemble for a smoothing effect. Designed with an ultra-thin, breathable fabric that is moisture-wicking and quick-drying and a no-squeeze silicone waistband that prevents rolling, this shapewear is as comfy as it is flattering. These best-selling booties have a chic baby heel and an elongated toe, with a padded interior for an easier break-in period. These sophisticated leather boots are well-suited for nearly any occasion, be it a trip to the office or a night out with friends. The 2.5-inch stacked heel adds a nice boost in height—that is, without needing to sacrifice on comfort. L.L.Bean's shearling-lined 10-inch boots are the warmest of the bunch, but any of the Bean Boots will serve you well through both fall and winter, and they go with most outfits. The boot that made L.L.Bean a household name. These boots are designed to keep feet dry, warm, and comfortable in rain, mud, and other wet conditions. As the second iteration of the Tree Dasher running sneaker, this version is even more comfortable and equipped for performance. Allbirds Women's Tree Runner sneakers are crazy comfortable with a flattering and close-fitting silhouette and have a smooth but texturized upper. It’s hard to think of a more legendary sneaker than Air Jordans. The Mid version, originally released in 2001, offers the classic look, cushioning, and stability of the OG High Top while being less restrictive and even more affordable (all colorways are on sale). They may be small, but these chunky double hoops add big style to any outfit. Choose from four color and metal combinations: double gold, double silver, gold/marble blue, gold/silver. With seven princess-cut diamonds set on a white gold band, this ring is perfect for a wedding band or special occasion. The coziest version of the cult-favorite belt bag, this fleecy material adds a comfy, lived-in feel to any winter outfit. The Mini Bow Bag is one of our favorite all-occasion bags for its versatility. It's equally at home at a formal event or a day on the town, and you can carry it as a top-handle bag, over-the-shoulder, or cross-body. This sleek leather wallet is ideal for those with dexterity issues as it can be opened with one hand, and it snaps shut with a satisfying magnetic seal. The 2022 MacBook Air introduced Apple's M2 processor, which improved performance over the M1 version. It has an especially thin and lightweight design, an improved webcam, and a larger display. Make sure to check for the 16GB RAM model, as it's becoming the standard base option instead of the original 8GB RAM model. The Series 10 is thinner than its predecessors, with a larger case and screen overall. It runs on the S10 processor; it has a wide-angle OLED display for easier reading at an angle, faster charging, and media playback from its speakers. The second-generation Apple Watch SE is an impressive entry-level wearable that shares the same processor as the Series 8 and Ultra, so it's still smooth despite being two years old. It doesn’t have the advanced health sensors of premium models, but it offers enough features to satisfy most people. Verizon is offering the iPhone 16 for free as long as the line using the phone is on the Unlimited Ultimate plan and the user doesn't switch phones for 36 months. Verizon is offering the iPhone 16 Pro Max without a trade-in for $5/month for 36 months (three years), which amounts to $180. The deal requires the Unlimited Ultimate plan for the line that's using the iPhone 16 Pro Max. If you switch phones before the 36 months period, you'll have to pay off the remaining balance of phone. New and existing Verizon customers can trade-in any phone in any condition from Apple, Google, or Samsung to get the iPhone 16 Pro free. You must keep the iPhone 16 Pro for 36 months (three years) to keep the deal active, and can't upgrade to a new phone. The line that's using this deal must have or upgrade to Verizon's Unlimited Ultimate plan. You also need service plans for the free iPad and Apple Watch. There may be a one-time $35 activation fee. It's possible to get an iPhone 16 Pro Max with this deal, but it would cost $5/month for 36 months. The Galaxy S24 Ultra is Samsung's top-end phone in 2024, set apart from its Galaxy S24 siblings and most of the premium phone competition with its four cameras, giant 6.8-inch display, stunning battery life, and included S Pen stylus. The Pixel 9 Pro XL offers a large 6.8-inch display and one of the best battery test results we've seen in a phone. The Pixel 9 Pro shares the same performance, first-rate three-lens camera system, super-bright Actua display, and Gemini AI suite with a free year of Gemini Advanced. Mint's Unlimited plan offers unlimited talk, text, and data, but you'll be slowed to 4G LTE speeds after using 40GB. New customers can get half off their first three months when they pay up front. We recommend signing up for the Unlimited option to score the most savings since it's typically the priciest of the lineup. When you buy an eligible phone through Mint Mobile, you can bundle it with a year of an unlimited data plan at a 50% discounted rate of just $15/month. The MVNO is also heavily discounting several phones from their standard starting prices, including up to $500 off the Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Dell's line of premium XPS laptops are known for their performance and reliability. The 9530 series features Intel's Core i7-13620H processor and starts with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. That should be plenty of performance and storage for most people with busy, fast-paced workloads. This Dell Inspiron's display folds 180-degrees to turn the laptop into a tablet. Running on the AMD Ryzen 5 8640HS processor, 8GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage, it can handle most people's workloads with ease. The base model IdeaPad 1 comes with a large 15-inch screen and runs on the entry-level AMD Ryzen 3 7320U processor with 4GB RAM and 128GB of storage. It's purely for very basic uses, like lightweight web browsing, but it's priced well for its purpose.

This new VPN deal drops the per-month price as low as $2.99 on a two-year plan.

It's beloved by frequent fliers, holds everything you need and then some, and stands out from the competition thanks to its attention to detail at every point. Away's new luggage line is the brand's first foray into soft-sided luggage. In our tests, soft-side bags surprisingly tend to be more durable than hard-sided bags and offer a bit more flexibility in packing space. One of our editor's recently tested this human-sized dog bed, calling it a "dream come true" and "like laying in a supportive cloud." The Coop Sleep Goods Original Pillow offers thoughtful features like adjustable fill, a washable pillow cover, and an unparalleled 100-night trial, making it the best choice for most people.

The Quest 3S is Meta's most affordable VR headset. It has the same chipset and gaming performance as the pricier Quest 3, but its display isn't as sharp. This is an excellent fit for casual users who want a more budget-friendly entry into the world of VR. This is a great time to buy, as you'll get a free download of the Batman: Arkham Shadow game (worth $50) and three months of Meta Quest+ (worth $24). The PS5 Slim Digital Edition doesn't include a disc drive, but you can buy one later on for $80 if you decide you want to play game discs later on. This package features some Fortnite-related freebies, including in-game outfits and weapons.

It also features a 1ms response time, a 1500R curvature, AMD FreeSynce Premium, two DisplayPorts, and two HDMI ports. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X shares many features with the more expensive Nova Pro, like a noise-canceling microphone and wireless cross-platform support, while maintaining a midrange price. This Corsair drive is a great all-around PS5 SSD with a selection of sizes from 1GB up to 8TB. The built-in heatsink saves you a few dollars over buying one yourself and makes for a slightly easier installation process. 1TB/2TB is plenty for most gamers and is where the best value lies as the price jump on larger capcities is wildly disproportionate on a dollar per GB ratio. The J9+ is a powerful robot vacuum that deftly navigates around household obstacles, leaves hardwood floors spotless, and tackles low-pile carpets with ease. Although we haven't tried this exact model, we've tested a similar Shark 2-1 robot vacuum with Matrix technology and had great results. It has both standard suction and mopping abilities, hence the 2-1 in the name. We tested the Shark PowerDetect in a different color and found it was the best robot vacuum for pet hear, thanks to its roomy, self-empty charging dock and powerful suction when it detects heavy debris. The Ecovacs DEEBOT X2 OMNI Robot Vacuum & Mop is a wet-dry vacuum robot that maps your house quickly and has a station with a hands-off self-cleaning system. The V15 Detect Absolute Cordless Stick Vacuum is one of Dyson's most powerful models. It features HEPA filtration and laser illumination to reveal hidden debris. This model usually runs north of $700, but it's 40% off right now. We've never seen it priced this low. The Dyson V11 Extra cordless vacuum cleaner is engineered with the power, versatility and run time for a whole-home deep clean. This cordless vacuum can help suck up pesky pet hair from anywhere in the house. At 4.5 quarts, this stand mixer is a bit smaller than we usually recommend for folks who want a full-size mixer, but this is a stellar deal if you don't mind the more petite capacity. The OXO Brew Conical Burr Grinder grinds slowly, but that in turn reduces static, noise, and inconsistencies in your grounds. Make cooking easier with the Ninja Air Fryer XL (AF150AMZ) and its five different cooking settings. From baking to dehydrating, this air fryer can be the new secret touch behind your recipes. This massive 14-qt. air fryer is just $50, and is equipped to handle large family-sized meals with two racks to cook double the food. It also uniquely has a built-in rotating rotisserie rack to make your own chicken roast. Coffee is a serious necessity for some, and the AeroPress is small, simple, portable, and easy-to-use way to brew a highly competitive, frothy cup of coffee somewhere between a French press and an espresso. This self-cleaning, programmable coffee maker allows you to choose your brew strength, so you always get the perfect cup of coffee. This white nonstick cookware set can help enhance any kitchen. It includes frying pans, a stock pot, saucepans with lids, and more. The classic 3D Whitestrips take only 20 days of use to complete a full treatment and also come with two sets of "1 Hour Express" strips for more last-minute whitening sessions. It may be pricey, but if you're looking for a high-tech hair dryer that actually lives up to the hype, the Dyson Super Sonic may be for you. The Dyson Airwrap is a little too much blow-dryer-brush for most people, but there are few systems that give you such versatility. This multi-styler comes with six different options for brush heads, complete with a styling comb, filter cleaning brush, travel bag, and storage case. Rihanna created this fragrance specifically for her own body and decided to share it with the world. A unique blend of Magnolia and musk with tangerine, the Fenty Eau de Parfum expresses itself uniquely on each wearer for a one-of-a-kind scent.

It’s an incredible value and includes three gorgeous color stories ideal for holiday parties and beyond. The most recently confirmed shade of Taylor Swift's iconic red lipstick, this warm brown-ish red was worn by Taylor to a 2024 Chiefs game. This cult-favorite concealer offers lightweight coverage that sinks seamlessly into the skin. This one-of-a-kind moisturizer is part skincare, part makeup. It's packed with nourishing oils like grapeseed. But instead of absorbing into your skin, the moisturizing ingredients sit on the surface and create a dewy glow that's also hydrating your skin. The Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence uses snail mucin to repair and fortify your complexion. Apple's latest generation of AirPods features a new design to optimize comfort for wearers of every kind. It's powered by the H2 chip and uses a smaller case than ever. Apple's base AirPods are now available with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) without the use of in-ear tips. The new model uses the brand's H2 chip to power features like Transparency Mode, Adaptive Audio, and Conversation Awareness. Sony’s WF-1000XM5 earbuds deliver excellent sound quality and noise canceling in a sleek, comfy design that’s tough to beat. Apple's update to the AirPods Max finally moves the headphones to USB-C charging and five new colors. Otherwise, the hardware and audio performance are largely the same. The Sonos Ace are the comfiest headphones we've reviewed. They also offer great noise-canceling and audio quality that rival top models from the competition. Anker’s Soundcore Life Q30 headphones offer noise-canceling performance that’s much better than it should be for the money, alongside solid sound quality and massive battery life. Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra once more put the brand on top, with best-in-class noise canceling wrapped in a sleek and comfy design. The Beats Studio Pro x Kim Kardashian are the same as the standard Studio Pro wireless headphones, but with a color curated by Kim Kardashian. They are designed to do it all, whether you want to be fully immersed in an album or take a call on the go. They offer both active noise canceling (ANC) and transparency modes, making them a versatile option for any situation. We've spotlighted The Ultra Puffer in our round up of the best Abercrombie Cyber Monday deals because it's a lookalike to Aritzia's SuperPuff and only costs $120 (plus, you can get it for an extra 15% off with the code CYBERAF). "It's a bit puffy, but that's balanced nicely by the short silhouette and faux fur accents," writes freelance author Talia Ergas. "The hood is detachable, which gives me two looks in one. I also love that the bottom hem is elastic, so it hugs my hips and keeps the cold out." Find more outerwear at a discount in our guide to the best Cyber Monday deals on women's winter coats. Two years ago, when I was busy hunting down an Xbox Series X, I wished someone from the future told me I wouldn't need one to play Xbox games. Much of my gaming isn't even through the pricey console but my Game Pass subscription. If I had resisted FOMO and waited, I could have saved hundreds by getting the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max instead, bundled with a wireless controller and one month of Game Pass Ultimate. Game Pass is the Xbox's cloud-based game streaming service, and the Ultimate package lets you access all available games on any supported device, including the latest Amazon Fire TV Stick. You're ready to play once you have the Xbox app downloaded and the controller connected. The Fire TV Stick is also a good option for when you're traveling and away from your Xbox console. With Game Pass, you can pick up a game where you left off. No, you won't get the full experience as you would on a Series X or Series S machine. But as long as you have a good connection, the visuals look great, and the gameplay feels similar to playing on the console. Les Shu I can't shower in silence. I need music, a podcast, or something to listen to. Enter the JBL Go 3 Bluetooth Speaker, currently just $30 for Cyber Monday. I like that it's waterproof, durable, gets plenty loud, and has decent sound quality, even when I crank it as I sing along to Kate Bush. Full disclosure: I've purchased two of these speakers. The first one lasted over two years before it stopped charging (it recharged using a USB-C connection). You see, I kept the speaker in the shower with me. So, every day, it would get completely drenched. That kind of treatment will cause any electronics to malfunction. So, I bought a replacement and kept it outside the shower, within reach, and it's worked like a charm. I have little patience for malfunctioning electronics and haven't had any troubles with the JBL Go 3. I especially like how easily it pairs with my phone via Bluetooth and stays connected for quite a distance when I wander off. At $30, this matches the lowest price ever for the JBL Go 3. I strongly recommend it for you or as an affordable gift for the shower singer in your life. Abercrombie has come a long way as a brand, especially when it comes to sizing. Gone are the days of disappointment from a roster of impossibly tiny sizes — we've since welcomed an era of unexpected but much-appreciated inclusivity. Our style team has been testing jeans for years, and Abercrombie's denim is some of the best for the price. You can read our review of Abercrombie jeans or check out the current Cyber Monday sale, which includes an automatic 25% off nearly every pair and an extra 15% off once you add them to your cart. Most of the brand's jeans come in sizes 23 up to 37, and many also come in several length options, including extra short, short, regular, long, and extra long. I'm just over 5 feet tall and I mostly wear the extra short or short sizes. I love that they don't just offer a single petite or tall length and call it a day — you can really get the size that's best for you. This discount is the best any of us have seen this year so far and we doubt it will happen again for a while, so you might want to get a move on tonight! Sally Kaplan If you have oily lids like me, you know how tough it is to keep your eyeshadow looking good throughout the day. With my almond-shaped eyes, I also experience a lot of trouble keeping eyeliner crisp in my outer corners, as most formulas rub away after a few hours. That's why I love Urban Decay's Eyeshadow Primer Potion — and right now, it's only $14, so I had to stock back up. The formula itself is sheer, but a little goes a long way. A thin coat keeps my eye makeup lasting all day, even in finicky places like my creases or outer corners. I've been a fan for years, and every year, I wait for this product to go on sale during Black Friday or Cyber Monday to restock. This year, I lucked out, and it was only half-price, making it super easy to add to the cart. We cover a lot of makeup here at Insider Reviews. Check out our beauty coverage to learn more about the best products for you, from waterproof mascaras to opaque concealers. Sarah Saril I'm not much of a beauty guru, but I love perfume. My prized Bond NYC bottle is running low, so I'm on the hunt for a new signature scent. When the Skylar Beauty Trial Set came up during Cyber Week, I jumped at the chance to try it out. Skylar is a clean beauty brand and its perfumes are hypoallergenic, vegan, and cruelty-free. The samples in the sale pack include Peach Fields, Vanilla Sky, Lime Sands, Salt Air, and Coconut Cove. I like that the collection is made of simple individual scents that can be paired for more complexity. This winter, I'm looking forward to experimenting with layering Vanilla Sky and Salt Air. Skylar rarely goes on sale, and even in the last few days, we've seen two different sale prices. Right now, you can get the trial set for $12.50, which is the best price we've seen all year. Lily Alig I've tested dozens of robots for our best robot vacuum guide, and one of my all-time favorite vacs is the Bissell SpinWave. It was one of the top picks in our guide for a while, but it's gone in and out of stock over the years, and the price fluctuates dramatically. I'd look elsewhere at its usual $400 price, but at its Cyber Monday special of $145, I strongly recommend it. What sets the Bissell SpinWave apart is its mopping performance. It features spinning mopheads that scrub the floor rather than just move the mess around. The vacuuming performance was also impressive, cleaning up most of the flour, kitty litter, coffee grounds, and pet hair I set out for testing. I especially recommend the Bissell SpinWave to pet lovers. It's great for cleaning up after pets, but it lacks obstacle avoidance in today's high-end robot vacuums. Still, you won't find a better option for automating your floor cleaning at this price point. James Brains Among the best Cyber Monday Apple deals, the Beats Studio Buds are an exceptional budget-to-mid-range wireless earbud option. The Amazon deal for 47% off matches the model's record-low price. I've had the same pair of Beats Studio Buds since 2021. They're a resilient product that has survived myriad forms of water and drop damage while retaining the same reliable, bass-heavy sound. I should note that the Studio Buds are far from the best noise-canceling headphones. I've since upgraded to our guide's top pick for in-ear noise-cancellation, the Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra Earbuds (which might also be worth your while at 23% off), to more adequately drown out the din of New York City's streets. However, I've kept the Studio Buds as a trusted backup pair and have come to appreciate their seamless pairing with Apple products relative to the Bose pair's occasionally finicky integration. In certain instances, I prefer the Beats' compact size and fit, even if it sacrifices sound quality compared to the high-end pair. For $80, though, you're sure to get your money's worth. John Lynch Winter is in full swing in Michigan, with wind chills remaining stubbornly in the teens. Yet, I'm just as stubborn when it comes to turning up the thermostat. Why should I crank the heat when I can keep it at a reasonable 64 degrees and just use a space heater if I get cold? This is where the Lasko MyHeat Personal Mini Space Heater comes in. Typically an already-affordable $25, the Lasko MyHeat is marked down to $17 for Cyber Monday. With a flip of the switch, I have instant warm air keeping me comfy at my desk. It occupies minimal space in my cluttered work area and operates quietly, so I can keep it running during meetings. I tested it for our best space heater guide, and it only increased the temperature in my 100-square-foot office by 2.5 degrees. However, it's not meant to heat whole rooms; instead, it offers a personal blast of hot air. If you want extra warmth without the added utility costs of heating your whole living area, I recommend spending the $17 on the Lasko MyHeat space heater deal. James Brains Bombas' massive Cyber Monday sale means everything's 25% off with code "BIGHOLIDAY25." You can feel good about stocking up because Bombas donates one pair of socks to charity for each one purchased, so by shopping tonight, you'll be ahead on your good deed for Giving Tuesday. The latest Bombas style I'm into is the cozy faux sherpa Sunday Slippers. I slide into them first thing in the morning, and they stay on as I get ready for the day, thanks to a raised rear around the heel cup. Their midsoles are made of a plush layer of memory foam laid over an EVA footbed, so the foam won't collapse the more you wear them. Learn why its socks are worth the try in our full Bombas socks review, and check out our guide to the best Bombas Cyber Monday deals. Gabrielle Chase The 2024 MacBook Pro running on the M4 Pro processor comes with 24GB RAM — 6GB more than the 2023 version. Today, the 2024 Pro is $250 off. It's an ideal machine for those who need untamed power in a portable package. The 2023 version is also on sale this Cyber Monday, but it's only $50 less with its deal, so I'd recommend going for the 2024 model. If you're looking for a powerhouse with a more modest price, the 2022 MacBook Air running on the M2 processor with 16GB of RAM is a rare bargain at $800, which is $200 off Apple's full price. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's an "older" model — Apple's M processors have incredible longevity and performance. The newer MacBook Air that runs on the M3 processor is $100 more with its deal, but we don't think the returns are significant enough for the extra money, at least not for those looking for the best value. The latest 15-inch MacBook Air M3 with 16GB RAM for $200 off makes a very tempting case. Its 15-inch display is a tangible upgrade, and the previous generation model is a bad deal with its 8GB of RAM, even if it's $300 off — you should get the latest M3 15-inch model for the newer processor and twice the RAM. Antonio Villas-Boas I wish I had waited until Cyber Monday to purchase the Monos Check-In Large suitcase. You could snag this hard-case check-in bag from one of the best luggage brands for as little as $251, regularly $355. This is the largest version of its standard check-in bag. The deeper savings are only available for select colorways. Monos' durable suitcases have a sleek look similar to Away, another popular luggage maker. I found the spinner wheels, zipper, and handle to perform well. Indeed, when my colleagues tested Monos' carry-on bags, they found them to be some of the best options at their price. That means a Monos sale is worth every penny. The best thing about Monos is that they offer a 100-day trial and free shipping. Provided there isn't damage or usage, you can return a product if it isn't to your liking. Besides Cyber Monday deals, Monos has discounts of up to 40% on select luggage and travel gear sitewide when you use the code CYBERWEEK. Les Shu If you're looking to elevate your camping experience, Solo Stove is offering 50% off its Campfire Gear Kit. The set normally sells for $200 but is down to $100, thanks to being one of many Solo Stove products discounted throughout its site. The Campfire stove works similarly to two of our top-tested recommendations in our best fire pit buying guide: the Solo Stove Bonfire and Solo Stove Mesa. This kit includes the basics: the Campfire camping stove, two pots, a tripod to hang a pot, and a carrying case. As someone who plans to camp more often, I decided the Campfire Gear Kit is a great way to get into cooking outdoors. The stove and pots are lightweight and easy to pack, so I wouldn't need to bring heavier camping cookware or propane gas tanks. While waiting for the fire to burn out, it can double as a small fire pit for making s'mores after dinner. The Bonfire and Mesa fire pits are also on sale, as are other fire pits, pizza ovens, camping stoves, and more outdoor products. It's Solo Stove's biggest sale of the year, so it's a good time to check out its camping and backyard gear. Les Shu As an only-on-New-Years-and-at-weddings drinker, I love when our team covers non-alcoholic spirits and beverages. Our resident whiskey expert, James Brains, has literally traveled up and down the Kentucky bourbon trail developing his palette. Monday is one of his favorite brands for non-alcoholic spirits. During Cyber Week, Monday is offering 30% off everything. The typical $45 price tag is worth it, but $15 off makes it even more compelling. Though we haven't tried the zero-alcohol gin or mezcal yet, we have high hopes based on our experience with the whiskey. James Brains called it "evocative of tootsie rolls" with a pleasant finish. In his blind taste test, the Monday Old Fashioned was the best and closest to the real thing. All the Monday bottles are gorgeous and great as holiday gifts. Shop the bundles or single bottles while the sale lasts. Lily Alig Since my wife's Apple Watch Series 5 started running out of battery before bed, I originally planned on swapping the battery out. I realized that the Apple Watch Series 10 came with so many upgrades that it felt worth buying that instead, especially with the $70 off Cyber Monday discount. My review of the Series 10 is coming, but I already know I love it: the new slim and lightweight design, the latest Vitals feature support in watchOS 11, major performance upgrade, Crash Detection, and fast-charge ability are hits for me and will be for my wife. Plus, she'll finally be able to track her sleep — something she couldn't manage with her old Apple Watch's battery without topping it off just before bed. On a $400 product, $70 might not seem like much of a discount, but it's pretty good for an Apple device that was just released in September. It's the best Apple Watch for most people, and it's going to make a neat, unplanned Christmas present. Antonio Villas-Boas When I research which stylish clothing our readers are most interested in, I also test to make sure they're actually comfortable. The Quince Ultra Stretch Ponte Wide Leg Pants are some of my favorite stretchy work pants I've found — they're from a lightweight Ponte fabric that makes me feel like I'm wearing leggings at work, and only to the untrained eye do they not look like slacks. They come in two inseams and six colors (which may be worth stocking up on while they're on sale for $15 off at $34.90). This pair runs short, so get the 32-inch if you're between lengths. You'll want to be sure of the fit, because the main caveat with the best Quince Cyber Monday deals is that they're non-returnable. Learn more about which Quince's styles we've tried in our full Quince review. Gabrielle Chase. I've tested over 100 mattresses for our best mattress guide, and there's one that blew me away — and I wish I could sleep on it every night — is the Tempur-Pedic Cloud. Right now, it's marked down to $1,399 for a queen, plus you get two free pillows. The all-foam Cloud is Tempur-Pedic's most affordable mattress, which means it's the least you'll pay to sleep on the company's amazing signature foam. I love the Tempur material because it contours to the curves of my body to keep my spine perfectly aligned while relieving pressure points. While testing the Cloud, I fell asleep within minutes each night. This is the mattress I'd buy if I weren't testing new ones every few weeks. The Tempur-Cloud is marked 30% off a few times throughout the year, but I've never seen it marked lower, so if you're looking to upgrade your sleep experience, I'd act on this deal now. With its risk-free home trial, you can return it within 90 days if you don't like it. Check out my full Tempur-Pedic Cloud Mattress review. James Brains. I scan thousands of deals over the course of the five-day shopping event we in product journalism (sort of) affectionately call "the Turkey Five" and while I see lots of great deals, there's rarely one that stops me in my tracks so abruptly that I have to share it with all my friends. For me, this year, that was Cuyana's sale — specifically its 20% discount on the never discounted System Tote. We named the System Tote the best tote bag we tested because it's chic, durable, and has a clever organization system (hence the name) that we haven't seen in other bags. Instead of a standard array of pockets and accessories, you customize the tote with ad-ons that suit your needs and each component snaps in and out. Not carrying a laptop today? Snap the optional laptop case out and gain back the interior space. One thing that really attracted me to the bag was that it's the nicest-looking tote I've seen that has an optional crossbody strap. Business Insider Reviews' executive editor Sally Kaplan has had a System Tote for about 4 years now, and it's her go-to bag for vacations, flights, weekend trips, and long car rides. "It fits an unbelievable amount of stuff, but it also doesn't look floppy or silly if I just put a few things in it," she says. "On a usual vacation, this bag will hold two pairs of shoes, my giant Dyson blow dryer, a hair brush, my toiletry and makeup bags, a scarf or sweater, and a couple of snacks." The downside is the System Tote is an investment at its normal price, especially if you want a lot of add-on components. I was holding out hope for a sale, but I was shocked to see Cuyana offer a discount this good. Past sales from the brand usually hover around 15% off, if they have a sale at all. I'm not the only one who thinks it's a great deal: there's only one sale color of the 13-inch tote and two colors of the 16-inch tote left in stock (fortunately, they're great colors). Cuyana's whole sale is worth taking a look at, especially since it likely won't come around for another year. We rounded up our picks for the best Cyber Monday Cuyana deals, so you have the absolute highlights. For more about what we love in this brand, check out our Cuyana review. Lauren Savoie. As Business Insider's air fryer expert, I've tested over 60 models for our best air fryer guide. There's one that I consistently recommend when people are considering buying this relatively new appliance: the Beautiful Touchscreen Air Fryer. Right now, it's marked down to an all-time low $59 at Walmart. Beautiful is Drew Barrymore's brand, sold exclusively at Walmart. I love it because it cooks evenly and quickly at a budget price. Though only two colors are on sale, white and Starry Night Blue, you can pick from ten colors, so there's sure to be one that matches your kitchen's decor. The six-quart basket of the Beautiful air fryer holds a lot of food for an air fryer at this price point. I cooked a pound of chicken wings to crispy perfection in 16 minutes. Frozen fries were restaurant-quality in 13. Plus, clean-up was a breeze. You can quickly wipe off the grime from the nonstick interior or pop it in the dishwasher. If you've been on the fence about air-frying, I strongly recommend you take advantage of this deal. With Walmart's 90-day return policy, what have you got to lose? James Brains. That's not a typo, nor is it an introductory offer for a month or two. This bundle gets you Disney+ and Hulu for $2.99 a month for an entire year. It's a genuine mic-dropper of a deal for two excellent streaming services. The caveat, of course, being that this is for the ad-supported tiers of both services. Individually, they're $9.99 a month, but the year-round Duo Bundle merges them into a $10.99 a month offer, so going down to $2.99 is a big deal for sure. You'll need to be a new customer to get this excellent rate, and you're not obliged to keep it for a year as it's a rolling one-month contract. If you let it keep rolling, the price will go up to $10.99 next December (or higher if prices go up by then). My advice: cancel a month early next year, and you'll be eligible for next year's Black Friday promo deal again. Brendan Griffiths. Like Black Friday before it, Cyber Monday sales have been disappointing for anyone looking to pick up an Xbox Series X. Unlike the PS5, Microsoft hasn't bothered with a Slim version and is generally still charging the same price it did for the console at launch over four years ago. However, it has just launched an all-digital Series X in white. And it's $100 cheaper than the disc-based console, thanks to a Cyber Monday deal knocking $50 off. So you can get the white Series X, with no disc drive for $398 at Walmart. That's still a lot of money, given the digital PS5 Slim is only $374 today. That said, if you are happy to forgo physical media, this might be tempting. The excellent Xbox Game Pass is a great subscription to fully embrace all-digital on Microsoft's console as it's absolutely packed with great new games. Brendan Griffiths. While some end dates for Cyber Monday deals are up in the air, Max has confirmed on its site that this massive deal will expire today. It could be midnight PT or maybe even ET, but it's into the final hours for sure. The 70% discount applies to the ad-supported tier, but for the next six months, you'll pay just $2.99 a month for Max, down from the usual $9.99. Given the quality of the shows on offer, this is one of the best Cyber Monday streaming deals we've ever seen. You can cancel before the six months are up if you wish. The offer is only open to new and returning subscribers. Brendan Griffiths. Looking for a pillow upgrade? The Coop's Original Adjustable Pillow is 25% off, the lowest price we've ever seen it go for. Usually $75, it automatically discounts to $56.25 at the checkout at Coop's site. This is the same pillow we put right at the top of our best pillows buying guide. The memory foam inside is shredded and you're encouraged to remove or add more (extra is supplied) to get just the right level of support required, so it's a great match for all sleeper styles. I've just ordered one myself after hearing multiple colleagues rate it so highly (and a bunch of other sites' pillow guides), even if part of me dies inside for spending $56 on a pillow. But seeing as the $20 memory foam one I bought at Amazon in July already feels increasingly flat, it's time to try a proper upgrade. Coop has a wider sale for other pillows and bedding with up to 50% off. You won't see the reduced prices on the item's listing page, just the percentage that's coming off at checkout, which is an odd way of trying to convert a sale, but there we go. Brendan Griffiths. I'd spent a lot of time before Cyber Monday weighing up a new TV. Having just moved to the US, I'm rebooting my entire setup which means picking up a TV and game consoles all over again. Having left an LG C2 behind in the UK, I was weighing up an OLED like the LG C4, Samsung 90D, or maybe even save a few bucks via the LG B4 line. But then I started reading the reviews of the Hisense 7N range and fell down the comparison video rabbit hole reading up on how its Mini-LED 144hz display with Dolby Vision is competitive with TVs more than twice its price. TLDR reader, I bought the 55-inch model for $479 at Best Buy - about half of what I'd budgeted for one of the others mentioned above. It's sat next to me right now, still boxed and unwatched, because I'm here, talking to you. Anyway, if you're tempted, check out; you can see this TV with hundreds smashed off the price of the 55-inch, 65-inch, and 75-inch models at Best Buy. Amazon's deals are $3 cheaper right now, but there's a long wait for delivery on all of them. Want more options? Check out Steven's full list of the best Cyber Monday TV deals. Brendan Griffiths. The regular deal price we see during flagship sale days has finally been beaten. That's quite surprising as the usual discounts from $250 down to $170-$160 already seemed generous enough, especially for an Apple product. Well, we have an all-time low price today: the 2nd Gen AirPods Pro are $154 at Amazon. Despite not having a proper upgrade in a few years, these remain some of the best earbuds on the market, with quality audio and excellent noise-canceling. This is for the newer USB-C model. If you have the original AirPods Pro 2, we wouldn't bother with these, as you're only getting a different charging port and some modest dust resistance. The sound quality and fit remain the same. Brendan Griffiths. Yes, the digital and disc-drive models of the PS5 Slim are still in stock at Amazon. The original non-slim PS5 is no longer in production, so this is the one you want. PS5 stock has been in and out all weekend, but the same record-low prices have been available on the console alone and in a new bundle with free Fortnite DLC. Even if you don't want the Fortnite content, snap that one up anyway, as it's not costing you anything extra. The digital model is down to $374 (down from $450), and the disc-drive version is $75 off at a reduced price of $424. Brendan Griffiths. Jump to

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Cyber Monday is done. It's finished. The big sales bonanza is through for another year. Hopefully, you were able to bag a bargain or two from the most-wanted items on your shopping list. But it's not all a complete disaster if you missed the sales as there are dozens of great deals still available – and I've rounded them up here. As a procrastinator myself and a seasoned deals editor, I've gone through today's remaining sales from Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and more and hand-picked the best Cyber Monday deals that are still available and worth your money. The good news is that some excellent offers are still available, with record-low prices on TVs, kitchen gadgets, Apple Watches, robot vacuums, and smart home devices from brands like Sony, Samsung, Bissell, and Ninja. I've been combing through offers for weeks, and I'm only listing worthwhile deals on highly-rated products. You'll want to act fast though, as now the Cyber Monday sales are over I'm not sure how much longer these deals will be available. I'm sure more Christmas sales events will go live at retailers over the coming weeks but this might be your last opportunity of the year to find items discounted for such low prices. Are you looking for a cheap air fryer deal this Cyber Monday? Walmart is offering a massive 50% discount on the top-rated Chefman air fryer, bringing the price down to $50. The eight-quart air fryer features a basket divider, so you can separate food for dual cooking. The LG B4 is one of the most affordable OLED TVs on the market, and Best Buy has the 48-inch model on sale for $699.99. It was $100 less over Cyber Monday but this is still a fantastic price. Its self-lit OLED pixels and Dolby Vision together enhance color and contrast beyond what the average backlit TV can do. Its built-in gaming features and 120Hz refresh rate make it an unbeatable deal for gamers looking for an upgrade. Here it is, folks - the best deal yet on the latest Dell XPS 13. Complete with a brand-new Snapdragon X Elite chipset, this model is capable of not just exceptional day-to-day performance, but also battery life that's simply a cut-above what Windows laptops usually offer. Alongside superb specs, the latest XPS 13 also features a gorgeous lightweight design and a display that's perfect for both work and casual everyday use. This is an incredible price for a pair of wireless on-ear headphones – on sale for just $24.95 at Amazon right now. The JBL Tune 510BT features Wireless Bluetooth 5.0 Streaming, so you can stream music and podcasts and take calls from your device, and you'll enjoy an impressive 40 hours of battery life. It's no t a model we've tested, but the JBL Tune 510BT have over 50,000 positive reviews on Amazon and are one of the best-selling headphones on the site. They also come with JBL's renowned Pure Bass sound. If you need something inexpensive and you need it now, it's hard to argue with this price tag… Apple's best-selling 10.2 iPad with 64GB of storage just dropped to $199 - a new record-low price. While the tablet is an older model, it still packs a 10.2-inch Retina display, and the A13 Bionic chip ensures excellent picture quality and superior performance. According to our Apple iPad 10.2 review, the entry-level tablet can do it all without issue, whether browsing the net, streaming media, doing light work, or playing games. At just $599 - Walmart is practically giving away Apple's MacBook Air. Not only is this an outstanding price for such a powerful laptop that still holds up great for 2024, but this could be the last chance to pick one up now that it's officially discontinued. Don't miss this incredible deal if you're looking for a great bang for the buck MacBook. This might be Amazon's best Cyber Monday deal - Apple's all-new Apple Watch 10 on sale for a new record-low price of $329. The Apple Watch 10 includes upgrades such as Apple's new S10 chipset, sleep apnea detection, depth gauge, and a new design featuring the most advanced display. I don't expect you'll find a better price this year, and this offer is in danger of being sold out. Get the best compact, single-serve blender for under $50 at Walmart's sale ahead of Cyber Monday. This is an ideal solution for your daily smoothie or protein shake. With its built-in handle and sippy cup lid, you'll be ready to make your favorite creation just before leaving the house. The Nespresso Vertuo Pop Plus Deluxe by Breville is on sale for its cheapest price yet. This easy-to-use coffee maker supports multiple types of drinks and sizes, and you can brew these using dedicated recyclable Nespresso pods. The large removable water tank and compact size also add to its convenience. The Ninja Creami ice cream maker will surely be a Cyber Monday best-seller due to its popularity at recent holiday sales, and Walmart has the appliance down to a record-low price. You can make ice cream, milkshakes, and sorbets with a touch of a button and add your favorite mix-ins and flavors. Are you looking for a cheap air fryer deal this Cyber Monday? Walmart is offering a massive 50% discount on the top-rated Chefman air fryer, bringing the price down to $50. The eight-quart air fryer features a basket divider, so you can separate food for dual cooking. KitchenAid is a mainstay in the Bake Off tent and still the leader when it comes to high-quality stand mixers – but they do come with a hefty upfront cost. This healthy $120 discount on the premium Artisan model definitely takes the sting out, though. It comes with a stainless steel bowl and three attachments for mixing, kneading, and beating – everything the amateur or intermediate baker needs for the kitchen. Amazon's best-selling 43-inch 4-Series 4K smart TV is on sale for $229.99 - a new record-low price. It offers 4K HD resolution, smart capabilities with the Fire operating system, and a voice remote with hands-free Alexa, so you can use your voice to control your TV. Amazon's all-new Fire TV Omni QLED Series is a big step up in the otherwise cheap range of smart TVs. This set boasts premium features, including a QLED display, full-array local dimming, Dolby Vision IQ, and HDR10+ Adaptive support to deliver a high-quality picture for all-around viewing and gaming. A good overall buy for the budget-conscious who don't want to compromise on performance, especially now that it's down to a record-low price of $599.99. The Sony Bravia 8 is back at its lowest price yet ahead of Cyber Monday. As one of the best TVs for sound, it's an ideal choice if you want stellar sound without paying extra for a soundbar. Its OLED screen might not be the brightest of them all, but it still manages to rival the picture quality of its competitors using its brightness-boosting Bravia XP Processor. You can even use it with your gaming console of choice thanks to the two HDMI ports (out of four total) that support 4K/120 Hz gaming. If you're looking for a big-screen budget display, Best Buy has this 75-inch 4K TV on sale for $549.99. This entry-level TV from Samsung packs a solid 'Crystal' UHD 4K processor, an easy-to-use Tizen operating system, and full HDR support all for under $600. That's good value for money if you need a straightforward but capable display for your everyday viewing and media streaming. The Hisense U7N is an affordable mini-LED TV that provides serious bang for your buck, packing great features and performance into a budget package. It supports all HDR formats, including Dolby Vision, comes packed with gaming features, including 4K, 144Hz, and Dolby Vision gaming, and uses Google TV as its smart TV platform. This Cyber Monday deal takes the 75-inch model to under $1,000 – for a TV with this much to offer at this much size, this is a superb deal. Bissell portable carpet cleaners have become the breakout stars at holiday sales like Cyber Monday, and the top-rated Little Green model is currently on sale for $81.49. Perfect for pet owners and parents, the portable carpet cleaner can magically erase spills and stains on carpets, couches, auto interiors, and more. If you're on a budget but still want a high-end vacuum, Dyso's V8 Absolute is a fantastic option at just $299.99. Perfect for pet owners, the Dyson V8 features a de-tangling motor bar that works across hardwood floors and carpets and can transform into a handheld vac for quick and convenient clean-ups. Amazon has the top-rated iRobot Roomba robot vacuum on sale for $149.99 - the lowest price we've ever seen. Designed with homes with pets in mind, the Roomba features three levels of powerful suction for custom cleaning on carpets and hard floors and recharges itself when the battery is low. The top-rated Tineco cordless wet-dry vacuum mop combo is on sale for a record-low price of $99 at Walmart's sale ahead of Cyber Monday. The Tineco iFloor 2 vacuums and washes hard floors in one step, handling wet and dry messes in one sweep. Dyson cordless vacuums are always Cyber Monday best-sellers, and Walmart has the powerful V12 on sale for $399.99 - a record-low price. The V12 is Dyson's lightest cordless vacuum and features illumination technology that reveals invisible dust on hard floors so you don't leave anything behind. Here's a deal ahead of Cyber Monday on a Roomba robot vacuum mop combo, bringing the price down to its lowest ever. The j5 uses the iRobot Home App to create no-mop zones, so it will vacuum your hard floors while mopping at the same time but will avoid your carpet. Here's a huge $440 discount on a powerful and advanced robot vacuum from big-name brand iRobot. We praised its ability to pick up dirt from carpet and hard floors, and its self-charging feature in our iRobot Roomba J7 Plus review plus the convenient self-emptying bin. It is a bit noisy and sometimes struggles with larger debris but this is a good overall option. If you're looking for a budget laptop, Walmart's Cyber Monday sale has HP's 14-inch laptop for just $129 – an incredible price. For that money, you're getting an Intel Celeron processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB of SSD, and up to 10 hours of battery life. It's hard to find a better cheap laptop deal in the early Cyber Monday sales than this Inspiron 15. It's nothing fancy, but this machine manages to pack in both a powerful Ryzen 5 chipset and a sizeable 512GB SSD in for just $300 - that's not bad to say the least. While you're only getting 8GB of RAM here, this is still a good choice if you're just looking for a cost-effective machine to cover the basics. This is the best discount I've seen on the new Microsoft Surface Pro – and it's a tempting buy after we were super-impressed in our Surface Pro 11 review. This version boasts a gorgeous 13-inch PixelSense Flow OLED display at 2880 x 1920 resolution so it looks sharp and crisp with some vibrant colors and deep blacks. Meanwhile, the Snapdragon X Plus processor ensures excellent battery life and combines well with its many AI features to simplify your life. There’s also 16GB of memory and 512GB of SSD storage which will ensure speedy performance and enough storage space for your essential files and applications. Dell's Cyber Monday deals on the higher-end XPS 13 models are also amazing this week. Take this Ultra 7 configuration, for example, a massive $400 price cut makes this one a lot easier on the pocket. While I wouldn't immediately recommend a machine with 32GB of RAM to everyone (it's overkill for most), this is a great choice for a professional-grade laptop. The Sony WH-1000MX4 are older now but they are still some of the best over-ear headphones ever. These wireless Sony cans package together top-notch audio, excellent comfort, and effective noise cancellation all at a reasonable price point that's about $100 less than the newer Sony XM5 that are only a minor upgrade. We still rate these as the best headphones for most people, exactly because you can find them at a price like this during major sales such as Cyber Monday. The Bose QuietComfort headphones are the manufacturer's mid-range noise-cancelling cans and have dropped to a record-low price in this deal ahead of Cyber Monday. On top of the manufacturer's excellent ANC to block out unwanted noise, you get high-fidelity audio and an EQ control to customize bass, mid-range, and treble. The QuietComfort lasts up to 24 hours on one charge and can get back 2.5 hours of playtime in 15 minutes. The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 are a refinement of the previous model with AirPods-like ear sticks, active noise cancellation, a 11mm driver, and AI-powered features like a voice-call booster and a translation tool – providing you have a modern Samsung phone. They look and feel good in your ears too with up to 5 hours of battery life with ANC on, making them good for your commute or workout. And now you can get them for as little as $39.99 with a trade-in, that's a bargain. Quite simply the best in Sony's class-leading wireless over-ear lineup. The older XM4 headphones were outstanding, the XM3 cans before it were excellent, and it'll come as little surprise to know that Sony's XM5 proposition is also incredibly hard to beat – especially with a whopping 25% off, equalling their lowest-ever price! They don't fold up like the XM4 but, as a quick glance at our Sony WH-100XM5 review proves, there's not much else to pick fault with. Looking to buy a smart speaker for a small space? Amazon's Cyber Monday deals include the all-new Echo Pop for just $17.99 - the cheapest Echo device you can buy right now. For that money, you're getting a compact smart speaker with Alexa built-in, so you can play music, ask questions, and check the weather completely hands-free. If you're looking for more robust sound, Amazon's Cyber Monday deals also include the Echo Dot for its lowest price. Amazon's best-selling smart speaker offers an improved audio experience, plus a new temperature sensor and all the handy features from Alexa, like playing music, answering questions, and checking the weather completely hands-free. Amazon's best-selling Echo Show 5 is on sale for a whopping 50% discount. The 2023 Echo Show 5 features a compact 5.5-inch display but packs impressive sound with deeper bass and clearer vocals. With Amazon Alexa, you can listen to podcasts, movies, music, and more. If you're after the best-value PS5 Slim console as well as the best-value bundle, then this Fortnite Cobalt Star listing at Walmart is the way to go. There have been savings galore for the Xbox Series X Digital Edition this Black Friday. And rightly so, as I feel its retail price is a touch on the pricey side given the lack of a disc drive. It's certainly more compelling below that $400 mark. Sadly there's no bundle here, but still a decent saving for the console itself. With fast performance for a smartwatch and a sleek design, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 is instantly likeable. And now you can save up to $200 when you trade in your current device – alongside a flat $60 discount. Samsung's latest wearable provides more precise heart rate tracking than previous models, while it also helps you monitor how stressed you are and how well you’re sleeping. Think of it as your personal assistant on your wrist and you’re not far off. It even suggests how to respond to messages and notifications. Last year's best Fitbit Inspire 3 deal has returned to its lowest-ever price of $69.95, $30/30% off the usual list price of $99.95. Available in both colors, you'll get 24/7 heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, and notifications from your communication apps. Get a massive $60 off the $160 Fitbit Charge 6 for a return to the lowest-ever price of $99.95. The ergonomic band and slender display provide sleep monitoring, multisport tracking, ECG, GPS, contactless payments, and more. ^ Back to all deals I'm TechRadar's lead for US deals and TV discounts, and I've been doing this for the last six years. I have a lot more experience than that, though – I've worked in ecommerce for 11 years. No one has combed through more deals than me, I promise you. Welcome to this afternoon's live coverage of all the best Cyber Monday deals still available. While there are just hours left until most offers expire, there are plenty of deals to shop from retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart.I'll highlight all the top offers on tech gadgets, appliances, and beauty items from brands like Apple, Samsung, Bissell, Dyson, Sony, and Keurig. The TechRadar team has also reviewed most of the products listed in the guide so we can help you find the right product at the lowest price possible. Remember that Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart's Cyber Monday sales end tonight, and this might be your last chance to score your dream purchase at a record-low price. If you're looking for the cheapest Cyber Monday OLED TV deal, Best Buy has LG's excellent 48-inch B4 OLED TV on sale for $599.99 - an incredible price for an OLED display.LG's B4 self-lit OLED pixels and Dolby Vision together enhance color and contrast beyond what the average backlit TV can do. Its built-in gaming features and 120Hz refresh rate make it an unbeatable deal for gamers looking for an upgrade.LG 48-inch B4 OLED TV: was $1,499.99 now $599.99 at Best Buy I already own the third-generation Echo Dot and can't imagine life without it. The smart speaker plays music, answers any question I throw at it, and tells me the weather forecast - all I have to do is ask Alexa. The compact Echo Pop is Amazon's latest smart speaker. It shares all the same features I love about the Echo Dot but in a more compact design. The best part? Amazon's Cyber Monday sale has included a free Amazon Basics Smart Color Bulb for just $17.99 - a massive 66% discount. Echo Pop + Amazon Basics Smart Color Bulb: was $39.99 now $17.99 at Amazon This would make a GREAT stocking stuffer idea – the wildly popular Apple AirTag 4-pack is on sale for its lowest price yet.The Apple AirTag is a handy Bluetooth location-tracking device that pairs with your iPhone. If you're like me and tend to misplace your keys or wallet, just attach the AirTag to anything you don't want to lose, and your iPhone will locate the item with Precision Finding technology.Apple AirTag (4-pack): was $99 now $69.99 at Amazon There's one Cyber Monday deal ending tonight that you need to see above the rest. It's this offer on Hulu that's already proved tremendously popular over the last few days. And, honestly, I can see why. You can pay just $0.99 per month for a Hulu subscription with ads, which saves you almost $100 over a year's membership. There's also an option to bundle it with Disney Plus for a measly $2.99 a month – another huge bargain for both streaming services. This one ends today, though, so it's definitely one I'd pull the trigger on as soon as possible. ENDS TONIGHT – Get Hulu for $0.99 per month There were a lot of disappointed faces in the TechRadar office when we saw the Kindle deals over Amazon Prime Day and the Prime Big Deal Days sale. A lot of us – and I'm sure many of you too – pinned a lot of hopes on big discounts during those Amazon-exclusive sales. And there wasn't much to be excited about at all. At least there's been some improvement in the Cyber Monday sales, with both the latest Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite getting their first-ever price cuts. Sure, both ereaders are nowhere near as cheap as I've seen previous versions in the past, but these are still decent offers for the new and improved models with bigger screens and longer battery life. I'm confident in saying these will likely be the best offers we see until at least July next year, so don't miss your chance to get a discount before the Amazon Cyber Monday sale ends later tonight.

The thinnest Apple Watch ever and the one with the biggest display is down to a record-low price this Cyber Monday. The 42mm Apple Watch Series 10 is just $329 (originally $399), and the larger 46mm is only $359 (originally $429). Both of these come in several shades, including a polished Jet Black finish, and feature an Always-On display that gets plenty bright. Out of the box, you'll find the latest version of watchOS 11 with the new smart stack. If you've been waiting to score the best Apple Watch for most folks, now's the time. Apple Watch Series 10 42mm (GPS): was $399 now $329 at Amazon Apple Watch Series 10 46mm (GPS): was $429 now $359 at Amazon This might be the best Cyber Monday TV deal I've spotted. The LG C4 is a successor to last year's LG C3 OLED, which TechRadar highly praised and is ranked in our best TV guide. Upgrades to the LG C4 include an improved picture experience with boosted brightness, a 144hz refresh rate, and LG's latest Alpha 9 AI chip.Today's deal from Amazon brings the price of this 42-inch model down to $896.99 - that's a new record-low price and an incredible deal for an OLED display.LG's 42-inch C4 OLED TV: was $1,499.99 now $896.99 at Amazon The Bissell Little Green portable carpet cleaner is an appliance I already own and can't live without, thanks to my two little messy boys. Perfect for pet owners and parents, it can magically erase spills and stains on carpets, couches, auto interiors, and more.While today's Cyber Monday deal isn't a record-low, it's the best deal we've seen this year, and I can't imagine you'll find a better price anytime soon.Bissell Little Green portable carpet cleaner: was $123.59 now $81.49 at Amazon The popular Ninja Creami ice cream maker is on my Christmas wish list this year, and Walmart is offering a $50 discount, bringing the price down to an all-time low. The Ninja Creami allows you to whip up your own ice cream, milkshakes, and sorbets with a touch of a button and add your favorite mix-ins and flavors. Ninja Creami ice cream maker: was $199 now $149 at Walmart I've had my eye on this compact indoor security camera since its release, and now that it's on sale for just $19.99, it feels like a no-brainer. The Blink Mini 2 features night vision and two-way audio so you can hear and speak to visitors, and it will alert your smartphone when motion is detected. Blink Mini 2: was $39.99 now $19.99 at Amazon I always include Crest's 3D Whitestrips in my favorite Cyber Monday deals, and it's one of my yearly purchases. They're expensive and rarely on sale, so Cyber Monday is the perfect opportunity to find them on sale. You get 48 whitening strips plus a bonus pair of one-hour express strips to have a whiter smile in no time.Crest 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects: was $45.99 now $27.99 at Amazon Gamers rejoice!

You can also access any PS5-capable titles, plus select tiles for previous consoles. This way, you can play your Sony favorites and get the mighty DualSense Controller included in the box.PS5 Slim Digital Edition: was $499.99 now $424 at Walmart It's hard not to recommend Sony's excellent WH-1000XM5, which are some of the best over-ear headphones you can buy. The previous model was already outstanding, but the XM5 are even better. We generally recommend the XM4 instead, because the difference is not that great given the higher price, but today's Cyber Monday deal at Amazon makes it a harder decision, with a whopping 25% off the newer model. If you do want to go for the XM4 instead, they're a full $100 cheaper, also at Amazon. Tough choices await!Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones: was $399.99 now $298 at Amazon Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones: was $399.99 now $198 at Amazon This is the best price you'll find on an Apple MacBook, and I'm shocked it's still in stock. Walmart is the only retailer that still has the M1 model for sale, and at just $599, it's an absolute steal.While the MacBook Air M1 is an older model (released in 2021), the 13-inch laptop still packs Apple's powerful M1 chip, 256GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, and up to 18 hours of battery life.Apple MacBook M1: was $699 now $599 at Walmart The pricey and rarely discounted Oura Ring is another item on my Christmas wish list, and thanks to Cyber Monday, Christmas just came early. Amazon has a rare discount on the ring, with prices starting as low as $249. The third-generation Oura Ring can track your sleep, activity, stress, and heart rate and is available in several different sizes and colors.Oura Ring Generation 3 Horizon: was $349 now $299 at Amazon If you're looking for a cheap and compact coffee maker, this Keurig deal is a must-see. Keurig's K-Express is just seven inches wide and compact, making it a great option for those working with a smaller kitchen space. The coffee maker can brew a cup in just minutes with different size options, from 6 to 12 ounces, using Keurig K-Cup pods.Keurig K-Express coffee maker: was $89.99 now $59.99 at Amazon It's now past Midnight ET, so Walmart's official Cyber Monday sale is over. The good news is that Best Buy and Amazon still have Cyber Monday deals available, and I'm still highlighting tonight's best offers. When it comes to cheap laptops, the official Dell Store is always a good shout over Cyber Monday. 2024 is no different in this regard considering you can pick up this heavily discounted Dell Inspiron 15 today. Not only does this one feature a Ryzen 5-7520U chipset for speedy peformance, but you're also getting a decently sized 512GB SSD here too. In short, this is a great choice for covering the basics. Dell Inspiron 15 laptop: was $449.99 now $299.99 at Dell It's almost midnight on the West Coast so many of this year's Cyber Monday deals are about to be gone for good – if they haven't ended already. The good news is that I'm already seeing several offers stick around even after sales have ended at some retailers, so you should be able to secure a few last-minute bargains if you've missed anything over the last few weeks. I'll continue sharing any of these hidden gems right here. And that's a wrap for Cyber Monday 2024. I hope you scored a great deal on exactly what you were looking for during the sales or found a bargain in all of the offers I've shared today and over the last few weeks. There'll be lots of wrap-up to do as a few sales should keep rolling this week and through to Christmas, so I'll be here continuing to search for all the best deals and highlighting them for you.

Title: I'd leave the Xbox controller on its shelf this Cyber Monday and buy this $35 gamepad instead

Do you really need a wireless controller? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The GameSir G7 SE is meant to be a budget controller that you can get for cheap, but I don't think it's supposed to be better than the official gamepad that comes in your Xbox's box. GameSir clearly didn't understand that assignment though, because although it has a cutesie look and an unassuming face, it's a fully-fledged pro controller for Xbox and PC that I'd easily recommend over Microsoft's version. It's also blissfully cheap thanks to Cyber Monday sales at the moment. Reduced from its $45 regular price, it's down to $35.99 at Amazon. That saving applies to all of its colorways, including the white, eggshell model I tested for review, as well as the Blue, Orange, and Purple versions that have been released since. Rather annoyingly, this Cyber Monday Xbox deal is a Prime exclusive, but luckily there's an offer on the retail page to take out a 30-day free trial if you aren't already a member. I've spotted the G7 SE drop down to this price a few times now, and it's always one I'd recommend to people looking for a spare controller to throw into their rotation because there's amazing value to be had from it. GameSir G7 SE | $44.99 $35.99 at AmazonSave $10 - A $10 reduction on an already very affordable controller is never a bad thing, and for your money here, you get two back buttons, audio controls, deadzone customization, and great ergonomics. Buy it if: ✅ You want a controller with back buttons✅ You don't mind a wired connection✅ You like a smaller-feeling controller Don't buy it if: ❌ You prefer larger, heavier controllers❌ You want color options GameSir doesn't provide UK: £39 at Amazon Whether you're a PC gamer looking for a controller to occasionally use in games that require one, or you're an Xbox player needing something up a level from the stock Wireless controller, the GameSir G7 SE is a great option. It's one of the more affordable Xbox pro controllers out there today, but it's still one of the first I'll look for when it comes to the likes of Black Friday and Prime Day because its features give even the expensive ones a run for their money. Two back buttons can make a huge difference after you spend a bit of time getting used to them. They mean you don't have to rely on quick thumb movements for all of your in-game functions, and in first-person games you don't need to take your thumbs off the sticks as much, resulting in better aim and movement. The back buttons here are placed beautifully so you don't need to adjust your natural grip to press them - they fall right under your middle fingers. GameSir was also one of the first brands to really embrace the anti-stick drift movement by adopting Hall Sensor thumbsticks in all of its products. If you've been burned by one too many cheap gamepads that have broken down over time, this is a brand I think you really need to know about. I've tested its best PC controllers over hundreds of hours at this point, and they're some of the most reliable I've ever used. The Windows app you can use to customize their deadzones, button mapping, and more is really impressive too. Of course, the one drawback to this controller is that it came out before Xbox relaxed its licensing parameters, and as a result, it can only work with your PC or Xbox with a wired connection. There is a 3m cable in the box here, but if that's going to be a dealbreaker, maybe check out one of the other best Xbox Series X controllers. There are more deals where that came from. Check out some Cyber Monday gaming PC deals, Cyber Monday Meta Quest deals, and Cyber Monday gaming chair deals. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more One of my earliest memories is playing SuperMario64 and wondering why the controller I held had three grips, but I only had two hands. Ever since I've been in love with video games and their technology. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship at Expert Reviews. Over the last decade, I’ve been managing my own YouTube channel about my love of games too. These days, I'm one of the resident hardware nerds at GamesRadar+, and I take the lead on our coverage of gaming PCs, VR, controllers, gaming chairs, and content creation gear. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Jump straight to the deals you want...1. Quick links2. PCG's top products3. Today's top deals4. Deal hubs5. Live updates That's it, Black Friday is well and truly done. But just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in to give you peak Cyber Monday gaming deals realness. Sure, we've got a guide going over the full range of the best Cyber Monday PC gaming deals, but I'm here to give you that personal touch, and highlight the deals as they pop up and give you the cream of the crop. Crops have cream, right? Like, oats have milk. I digress. As Cyber Monday begins properly today, and Cyber Week goes on beyond that, we've already seen a bunch of last week's deals either go out of stock or rise to the point where we no longer recommend them. BUT that's not to say that they won't be back. What we often see is that specific Black Friday deals that might have gone 'off sale' over the weekend get picked up again on Cyber Monday and sold as fresh deals. But, y'know, with the same price. There will also be some genuinely fresh deals cropping up over the next few days as Cyber Week cracks on. Already I've found a couple of good gaming laptops and gaming PCs that weren't around just a few days ago. There are also some actually great handheld gaming PC deals, too. So, if you've been itching to get on the mobile gaming bandwagon there literally has never been a better time. So, if you're in the mood to either treat yourself, or make sure you get your Christmas shopping done early, and with a smattering of solid discounts to make your money go further, stay with me as I'm going to keep on hunting out the best tech deals this Cyber Week and posting them here. We'll also be regularly updating our Cyber Monday deal hubs throughout this time, but this is where I want to highlight here my absolute favorite PC gaming deals. But why me? Well, I've been doing this a long time. Way before Black Friday or Cyber Monday were fashionable—I mean, look, all the cool kids are doing it now—I was casting around to find you lovely people the best deals, and I've also been a technology journalist for over 19 years now so I've got a pretty good idea of what's good, what's not, and what's just some retailer or manufacturer trying to make a fast buck out of old stock. As well as the best deals, we're also tracking down the best prices on the key products from our full suite of product buying guides. We maintain those guides throughout the year, completely based on products we have reviewed ourselves and can absolutely stand by their continued excellence. Dave's been doing the PC hardware dance since back in 2005, and building gaming PCs since the '90s. You know, when it was difficult. In his time he's tested every type of PC component, peripheral, and accessory you can imagine, and probably some you can't. That makes him perfectly placed to recommend the best deals, and the ones you need to steer clear of this Black Friday. Nvidia GeForce-powered gaming PCs AMD Radeon-powered gaming PCs Gaming laptop deals Graphics card deals Gaming monitor deals 1. Yeyian Tanto | Intel Core i5 13400F | RTX 4070 Super | 16 GB DDR5-5600 | 1 TB SSD | $1,599.99 $1,199.99 at Newegg (save $400)Yeyian has a stellar deal on an RTX 4070 Super machine here. We've seen slightly cheaper versions on sale, but this one at least does have proper DDR5 memory, making the motherboard at least nominally upgradeable to a more modern spec. It does make a bit of an odd combo with the Core i5 here, though for straightforward gaming performance, it shouldn't prove any issue and deliver high frame rates. 2. Corsair TC100 | Fabric and leatherette | $249.99 $179.99 at Best Buy (save $70)The TC100 is our favorite affordable gaming chair right now, following up on the popular T3 Rush with a great look and genuine comfort. You can read more in our review. Right now, even with only a light discount, it's a truly excellent gaming chair that's cheaper than most of its competition. Price check: Corsair $179.99 | B&H Photo $179.99 (sold out) | Amazon $179.99 (sold out) 3. Yeyian Tanto | Core i5 13400F | RTX 4060 | 16 GB DDR5-5600 | 1 TB SSD | $1,099 $749.99 at Newegg (save $349.01)This isn't the cheapest RTX 4060 gaming PC we've found this sales season, but this is the one that I'd be buying right now. While the other budget systems are similarly sporting last-gen CPUs, the Core i5 13400F is identical to the 14th Gen alternative, and faster than the Arrow Lake chips for gaming. Paired up with an RTX 4060 and 16 GB of relatively quick DDR5 memory makes this a great budget system. 4. MSI MAG 321UPX | 32-inch | 4K | 240 Hz | QD-OLED | $799.99 at Amazon (save $100)With its special launch price of $949, the MSI MAG 321UPX was already by far the cheapest of the new generation of gorgeous high-pixel density 4K gaming OLEDs. But you can already get for $50 off. It makes most 27-inch 1440p OLEDs look painfully overpriced. It may be out of stock when you click through, but it's worth checking back for this great deal. Price check: Newegg $799.99 (sold out) 5. MSI RTX 4070 Ti Super | 16 GB GDDR6X | 8,448 shaders | 2,655 MHz boost | $839.99 $739.99 at Amazon (save $100)The RTX 4070 Ti Super might be relatively new to the market, but we're still seeing some discounts on what is a very performant card. This model is very solid and comes with a triple fan cooler, and with the power of DLSS 3 makes for a mighty addition to any gaming rig. RTX 4070 Ti Super price check: Newegg $739.99 | Walmart $759.99 | Best Buy $799.99 6. MSI Vector 16 HX | RTX 4080 | Core i9 14900HX | 16-inch | 1600p | 240 Hz | 1 TB SSD | 32 GB RAM | $2,099 $1,849 at B&H (save $250)Of the two MSI Vector machines we've highlighted here, I'd rather this one. It has a newer, more powerful CPU, a better screen resolution and refresh rate for an RTX 4080, and 32 GB of RAM. Altogether, that makes for a pretty sweet package and an upgrade worth the extra $100 over the cheapest RTX 4080 laptop we've found so far. Price check: Microcenter $1,999.99 7. ASRock Phantom Gaming | 27-inch | 1080p | 165 Hz | IPS | $179.99 $99.77 at Newegg (save $79.22)ASRock has become a favorite of ours around here over busy shopping periods. These screens always seem to be on offer, and from the one we've used (read our review) they're good value for the money, too. You can't really complain with this 165Hz panel for just under $100. 8. HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless | 50 mm drivers | 15-21,000 Hz | Closed-back | Wireless | $199.99 $125.99 at Amazon (save $74)The HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless is one of our all-time favorite gaming headsets for many reasons, but there's a big headline feature to talk about here: 300-hour battery life. No, we didn't make a typo. 300 hours of gaming goodness on a single charge, excellent DTS:X Spatial Audio, and premium comfort features make this headset an absolute stunner of a buy at this price. In fact, when we reviewed it the only major negative we could find was a slightly uninspiring microphone. Absolutely worth a serious look this one, at any level of discount. Price check: Walmart $149.99 | Newegg $144.99 9. ASRock Challenger RX 7800 XT | 16 GB GDDR6 | 3,840 shaders | 2,475 MHz boost | $469.99 $449.99 at Newegg (save $20)At this price point, the best card used to be the RX 6800 XT but these days we have deals like this one, where the 7800 XT has the same price tag. It's only a little bit faster than the card it's replaced, but you're still getting a lotta GPU for the money. RX 7800 XT price check: | Best Buy $469.99 | Amazon $449.99 10. LG UltraGear 34GP63A-B | 34-inch | 3440 x 1440 | 165 Hz | VA | Curved | $399.99 $239.99 at Amazon (save $160)At its current price, this LG ultrawide is a genuine bargain. By comparison, Alienware's fancy QD-OLED 34-inch panel is around $800 even on sale. This LG matches its size, resolution, aspect ratio and refresh rate for less than one-third of the price, although of course, it is a VA panel, not an OLED. It's also not the brightest gaming monitor ever, but it is a very good deal. Price check: LG $239.99 The number of sub-$200 gaming monitors, that are both high refresh rate and with a 1440p native resolution is nuts. That used to be the preserve of much more expensive screens, but thanks to the Cyber Monday gaming monitor deals going down right now, you're getting big brand monitors on sale for often actually less than $150. Now, that's not exactly throw away money, but it's now a price where you could probably suck it up for the extra sharpness and Windows screen real estate you get with a 2560 x 1440 screen. And these are either IPS or VA panels, too, like actually good displays. These are five of the best still around: Acer KA272U | 27-inch | 1440p | 100 Hz | IPS | $199.99 $139.99 at Best Buy (save $60)If you're on the tightest of budgets, this will get you a decently sized 1440p monitor for a real bargain price. It's even got a higher-than-60 Hz refresh rate. Okay, 100 Hz isn't spectacular, but it is still notably smoother than 60 Hz. It's also not the brightest screen, rated at 250 nits peak, but the compromises will have to come in somewhere. If you want something brighter, the $145 ASRock below is a true winner. ASRock Phantom PG27Q15R2A | 27-inch | 1440p | 165 Hz | VA | $239.99 $142.77 at Newegg (save $97.22)ASRock's gaming monitors are always so darned cheap—we love them for that. This 1440p panel offers resolution and a rapid refresh rate for a potent PC gaming combo, though the built-in Wi-Fi antenna helps it stand out from the crowd. That's hardly essential, but could come in use for some. Acer Nitro ED270U | 27-inch | 1440p | 170 Hz | VA | $249.99 $149.99 at Newegg (save $100)This is one of the best deals on a 1440p gaming monitor we've seen so far. A respectable brand and a respectable spec, although it might be worth holding out for an IPS panel. Still, a good price on a great little screen. Price check: Amazon $184.10 Acer Nitro XV271U M3bmiiprx | 27-inch | 1440p | 180 Hz | IPS | $289.99 $169.99 at Amazon (save $120)This Acer monitor is a steal for all you prospective competitive gamers, hitting a high refresh rate and low response time sweet spot (0.5-1 ms gray-to-gray). It's the same price as the Odyssey G5 below but is better for those of you who prefer an IPS panel to a VA. Price check: Newegg $251 Samsung Odyssey G5 G55C | 27-inch | 1440p | 165 Hz | VA | Curved | $299.00 $195.99 at Newegg (save $104)This monitor was already a great deal at its previous price. Now, for well under $200 it's a steal. Samsung has form when it comes to getting VA panels to achieve good response. Put simply, Samsung VA panels are the quickest. I'm going to say that, for my Cyber Monday bingo, I did not have two actually pretty damned good RTX 4070 gaming laptops on sale for less than $880. Okay, they're only a solid cent under that price, but still, that is an unprecedented pricetag for any gaming laptop sporting this GPU. The only issue with either machine is that they are sporting a single 512 GB SSD which is guaranteed to get filled with games as fast as you can download them. At the moment 1 TB is kinda the minimum we'd want as our boot drives, but both of these impressive budget machines come with spare M.2 slots in the back of them, making an SSD upgrade as easy as it could possibly be. If it's my money, I think I'd be more tempted by the HP machine with its more up-to-date AMD Ryzen CPU. That's a proper Zen 4 chip in there, rather than the slightly odd Zen 3.5+ offering in the Lenovo. But still, I really like the Lenovo chassis and keyboard, so it's still a bit of a toss-up. Both are going to perform well in games, that's for sure. HP Victus 16 | Ryzen 7 8845HS | RTX 4070 | 16 GB DDR5-5600 | 512 GB SSD | $1,399.99 $879.99 at Best Buy (save $520)This is easily the cheapest RTX 4070 gaming laptop on the list right now, and the cheapest I think I've ever seen one on sale for. The RTX 4070 isn't a super low spec either, and seems to be a 115 W version. The only real concern I have is that the 512 GB SSD will get filled up fast, but there is a second SSD slot easily accessible in the back of the laptop, so is an easy upgrade. The screen isn't super bright, either, but at 300 nits it will be fine unless you're in a bright office or direct sunlight. Lenovo LOQ 15ARP9 | RTX 4070 | Ryzen 7 7435HS | 15.6-inch | 144 Hz | 16 GB RAM | 512 GB SSD | $1,199.99 $879.99 at Walmart (save $320)This is the cheapest RTX 4070 gaming laptop I've seen so far this Black Friday/Cyber Monday period. Not only that, but it doesn't entirely suck in other ways. There's a reasonable amount of dual-channel memory and a speedy IPS screen. The 512 GB SSD does, however, suck, but you can easily upgrade it with the spare NVMe slot inside. Do you know what I'm obsessed with when it comes to gaming laptops? Inches. Namely 14 of the old imperial measurements. That's right, I frickin' love a 14-inch gaming laptop. Now, I am a man of a certain age, with fading eyes, but even then I think that size of laptop and laptop screen are the perfect scale for a genuine mobile gaming machine. The new 16-inch machines maybe aren't that much bigger, but for me they're still just getting on for that too big for travelling thing. A 14-incher, however, is much more easily used on plane's tray table, much better for balancing on your knees when you're sat on the floor in a crowded departure lounge, or even just to sit on a wee cafe table. And you can get serious performance in that slight form factor now, and there are some decent Cyber Monday 14-inch gaming laptop deals. The first thing to note is that there is absolutely a price premium for this smaller laptop form factor, so if that is absolutely your primary concern there are far cheaper RTX 4060-powered gaming laptops around. Because, yes, these machines are rather pricey in the context of RTX 4060 laptops, in fact you can find several RTX 4070 notebooks for less. But if you're after the form factor, these are the best 14-inch deals going. Omen Transcend 14 | RTX 4060 | Core Ultra 7 155H | 14-inch | 2880 x 1800 | OLED | 512 GB SSD | 16 GB RAM | $1,729.99 $1,129.99 at HP (save $600)This is a very specific type of laptop for a very specific type of person, but if you are that person, there's a good saving to be had. It's a teeny tiny little device with an RTX 4060 and one of Intel's Meteor Lake chips inside it. It has a more sleek chassis than most on this list, though that does come with a higher fee. It's basically RTX 4070 money for an RTX 4060. Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 | RTX 4060 | Ryzen 9 8945HS | 16 GB LPDDR5X | 1 TB SSD | 1800p | OLED | 120 Hz | $1,599.99 $1,199.99 at Best Buy (save $400)You're really paying for the form factor here, as you might have noticed this laptop is surrounded by similarly price machines with RTX 4070s in them. Though the G14 is a wonderfully compact machine with a gorgeous OLED and all-metal chassis. It's a premium pick—there's a reason they're competing with Razer's Blade laptops—and the premium price can only be avoided so much. Still, $400 off isn't bad. Asus TUF A14 | RTX 4060 | Ryzen AI HX 370 | 14-inch | 16 GB RAM | 1 TB SSD | $1,499 $1,349 at Walmart (save $150)The TUF A14 was a bit of a surprise package to arrive in the PCG office this year, and I ended up a big fan in my review of it. It's a big upgrade on the previous generation of 14-inch, taking many of the design notes from the premium Zephyrus range, but doing so in a more affordable form. It's still a little pricey for an RTX 4060 laptop if that's all you're after, but for a compact 14-inch version with AMD's latest, even a small discount is decent. Keep it clean, people. You're desktop, I mean. I am, however, a man living in a glass house lobbing rocks about because if you were to glimpse my office space in PC Gamer Towers it would shock and disappoint you. It's gross. And I could probably do with at three of the five different PC cleaning goodies that our Jess has tracked down this Cyber Monday. SNACTIV PRO Finger Chopsticks | 4.21 inches | Glow in the dark | Dishwasher safe | $19.99 $15.79 at Amazon (save $4.20)If regular chopsticks require just a wee bit too much coordination for you—no judgment here—this tweezer tool that slips between your knuckles may be the perfect alternative utensil for eating your crumbly snack of choice. Tassmpitor Laptop and Keyboard Cleaning Kit | Cleaning brushes | Lens cleaner pen | Keycap puller | Refillable screen cleaning spray | $15.99 $12.27 at Amazon (save $3.72)Compact and portable, this cleaning kit has everything you need to keep your keyboard from getting crusty. With multiple, dainty little tools, there's nowhere to hide for dust, dirt, or crumbs. Compressed Air Duster & Mini Vacuum Keyboard Cleaner | Cordless | Range of detachable nozzles | $27.99 $21.99 at Newegg (same $6)This portable, handheld vacuum cleaner can do so much more than keep your keyboard free of crumbs. When sucking up dirt just won't suffice, the air vent on the back of the device lets you switch up your cleaning tactics. Colorcoral Universal Dust Cleaner Gel | Yellow | Lemon scent fragrance | No rinse necessary | Reusable | $11.99 $5.91 at Amazon (save $6.08)When a brush or vacuum just won't do, you'll need something that can take hold of the situation with an adhesive grip. Make no mistake, this will root out the toughest of dust bunnies from your hardware. VCOM RGB Gaming Headphones Stand | Black | 2 USB Type-A ports, 1 USB Type-C port | RGB lighting | 10 light modes | $21.99 $18.04 at Amazon (save $3.95)Tidy up your desk setup with this all-in-one stand. Stack your gaming headset, gamepads or other controllers, and more all on this snazzy rack with RGB lighting. There are still a ton of great Cyber Monday gaming PC deals alive out there. And our Andy has been running the rule over what's left and in his wisdom he's calling out these as the five best gaming PC deals still going strong today. CyberPowerPC Gamer Master | Ryzen 5 5500 | RTX 4060 | 16 GB DDR4 | 1 TB SSD | $879.99 $749.99 at Best Buy (save $130)This may be sporting a budget processor from a couple of AMD generations ago, but in combination with that RTX 4060 it should still be a mean lean machine for 1080p gaming—with even the odd dollop of 1440p thanks to DLSS 3. You're also getting a full 1 TB SSD and 16 GB of, admittedly DDR4, memory into the bargain. The AM4 platform may be old now, but it still has upgrade legs, and you could eventually stick a Ryzen 7 5700X3D in there to really beef up the gaming performance for not a lot of cash. Yeyian Tanto | Ryzen 5 7500F | RTX 4060 Ti | 16 GB DDR5-5600 | 1 TB SSD | $1,299 $949.99 at Newegg (save $350)This is the cheapest RTX 4060 Ti build around at the moment, and is actually a pretty decent rig. There are other options with low-end Core i5 chips, but this Zen 4 F-series CPU comes with six cores and 12 threads, and sits in an AM5 motherboard which gives it an upgrade path. The board is pretty low-spec however, so will likely only have space for the one SSD, but what you get is a full 1 TB. And that 16 GB of DDR5-5600 is pretty quick, too. Yeyian Tanto | Core i5 14400F | RTX 4070 | 32 GB DDR5-6000 | 1 TB SSD | $1,599 $1,149.99 at Newegg (save $350)RTX 4070 machines can vary in price and specification quite significantly, but here you're getting that great 1440p GPU (with even some 4K credentials thanks to DLSS 3), a nice and speedy Core i5 paired with a proper 32 GB dose of DDR5 RAM, and a 1 TB SSD. That's a really great selection of hardware that makes it a great gaming rig for more like budget prices. iBuyPower RDY Slate | Core i7 14700KF | RTX 4070 Super | 32 GB DDR5-6000 | 2 TB SSD | $1,999 $1,399 at iBuyPower (save $600 with checkout code CYBERMONDAY)Yes, you can find slightly cheaper RTX 4070 Super builds right now, but not one that's as well-rounded as this particular beastie. With this machine, you're getting an up-to-date platform with a particularly fast CPU (ensure it has the latest BIOS, though), 32 GB of fast RAM, and 2 TB of storage. Noice. Yeyian Gaming PC | Core i7 13700F | RTX 4080 | 32 GB DDR5-5600 | 1 TB SSD | $2,299.99 $1,999.99 at Newegg (save $300)While this is the old RTX 4080 and not the Super variant, it's got virtually identical performance, so this machine's still a mighty powerful rig for less than $2,000. The Core i7 CPU is a fine pairing for the GPU, and is backed up by 32 GB of relatively speedy DDR5 memory. The 1 TB SSD is the bare minimum amount of storage you'd expect to see at this price, but this is still an excellent gaming PC for the money. Look at it. JUST LOOK AT IT! Now, that's a controller. Seriously, this 8BitDo pad is outstanding. Not even just for the fact that it's only $25 right now in the Cyber Monday sales, but because of what you get in it. We're talking Hall effect sticks, so no more drift, AND Hall effect triggers, too. Normally we find it hard to look past the stock controllers from Microsoft and Sony for a pad recommendation; they're just so well built and genuinely affordable. But the 8BitDo Ultimate 2C has everything they do, and more. Our Jacob has been testing it recently for a review and has become rather enamoured with the controller. 8BitDo Ultimate 2C Wireless | Mint | $29.99 $25.49 (save $4.50 at Amazon)We've already raved about Hall Effect joysticks and how they spell the end for the dreaded stick drift. In this wireless gaming controller, they're a welcome feature, as are the extra bumper buttons. Oh, and that's a seriously cheap price tag for a quality product, of course. Which is the main reason to pick one up: it feels very premium for the price. Just a good old fashioned great PC for a great price. There are cheaper RTX 4070 Super machines, but this one comes with a spec so well rounded that you will not be able to find a tangible flaw in this build. Normally we will complain about a miserly 1 TB of SSD storage space in a $1,400 gaming PC, but not here, because iBuyPower has jammed a full 2 TB drive in there. We won't complain about the memory so much, but we do expect at least 16 GB of RAM in our modern gaming PCs. Here iBuyPower has gone over and above again, with 32 GB of the good stuff in there. And I mean good stuff, too, because it's quick 6000 MT/s DDR5, which is just about the sweet spot for that Intel Core i7 CPU. It's a quality spec, for a quality machine. iBuyPower RDY Slate 8MP 002 | Core i7 14700KF | Nvidia RTX 4070 Super | 32 GB DDR5-6000 | 2 TB SSD | $1,999 $1,399 at iBuyPower (save $600 with code CYBERMONDAY at checkout)Yes, you can find a cheaper RTX 4070 build right now, but not one that's as well-rounded as this one. With this, you're getting an up-to-date platform with a fast CPU (ensure it has the latest BIOS, though), 32 GB of speedy RAM, and 2 TB of storage. Noice. The Lemokey G1 is an excellent, affordable wireless gaming mouse, now made even more affordable thanks to the Cyber Monday deals. It's accurate, lightweight, and feels good in the hand. In fact, I think I might prefer it to the DeathAdder V3 Pro which I use every day, and which now feels rather chunky in my soft gamer hands. With the Lemokey G1 at just $52 at Amazon you're getting a serious wireless gaming mouse for the money. With key specs, such as the 30K DPI, and 750 IPS tracking, it's a great mouse for gaming. Though I would ask you to ignore the 8K polling rate stuff; that's of dubious benefit at the best of times, and here it doesn't really work brilliantly and will just drain the battery more than is really necessary. Lemokey G1 | Wireless | 30,000 DPI | 55 g | $74.99 $52.49 at Amazon (save $22.50)Lemokey is better known for its gaming keyboards I'll wager, as the gaming subsidiary of Keychron, but it also makes great, affordable gaming mice, too. I recently reviewed the G1, and came away very impressed, even over the DeathAdder V3 Pro I use daily. The Lemokey is lighter and just feels more rapid. It's also a lot more affordable, espeically at this price. Just don't get too carried away with its promises of 8K polling—that just drains battery and performs a bit weirdly. Price check: Lemokey: $62.10 No rebate, no Prime members only shenanigans, just the cheapest price we've seen the Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti Super retailing for ever. Now, granted it's not a spectacular discount in real terms—while the MSI MSRP is down as $839.99, the standard MSRP was $799.99—this is still the most affordable the card has been. In the run up to the new GeForce generation dropping in January you might question spending even the $740 the MSI RTX 4070 Ti Super is going for on Amazon. That is a valid concern, and if you're happy with your current setup and reckon you'd fine waiting until at least the middle of 2025 to upgrade, then by all means wait and see what launches in that price bracket, and wait for it to come back into stock after the first flush of RTX 50-series GPUs get swallowed up. But if you're after a new graphics card today, and one that is pretty damned powerful but not too punitively priced, then the RTX 4070 Ti Super—dumb name and all—is a worthy purchase. MSI RTX 4070 Ti Super | 16 GB GDDR6X | 8,448 shaders | 2,655 MHz boost | $839.99 $739.99 at Amazon (save $100)The RTX 4070 Ti Super might be relatively new to the market, but we're still seeing some discounts on what is a very performant card. This model is very solid and comes with a triple fan cooler, and with the power of DLSS 3 makes for a mighty addition to any gaming rig. RTX 4070 Ti Super price check: Newegg $739.99 | Walmart $759.99 | Best Buy $799.99 Boo, the most affordable 4K OLED gaming monitor, that MSI one that was on sale for $700 over the past week, has lost its discount. Now that one is back up to $867 at Amazon. Nightmare. Well, not too much of a nightmare because the 240 Hz version of that MSI OLED, the MSI MAG 321UPX is still on sale for less, for $800 at Amazon. It sucks that it's $100 more than the Black Friday deal, but is still a great price for a 32-inch 4K OLED gaming monitor that was once around the $1,000 mark. In fact, most of the other 4K OLEDs using the same 32-inch panel are still retailing for over $1,000, so this still represents a good Cyber Monday gaming monitor deal. MSI MAG 321UPX | 32-inch | 4K | 240 Hz | QD-OLED | $799.99 at Amazon (save $100)With its special launch price of $949, the MSI MAG 321UPX was already by far the cheapest of the new generation of gorgeous high-pixel density 4K gaming OLEDs. But you can already get for $50 off. It makes most 27-inch 1440p OLEDs look painfully overpriced. It may be out of stock when you click through, but it's worth checking back for this great deal. Price check: Newegg $799.99 (sold out) Wireless gaming mice are grand, but largely a nice-to-have luxury. Wireless gaming keyboards are... well, IMO kinda pointless at best and a pain in the butt at worst. But wireless gaming headsets, that's a PC peripheral that I would say was made for low latency wireless protocols. Though it must be said a good wireless mouse is more affordable today than ever before. But I digress. The thing is, whether you think the cable on a mouse is unsightly, unless it's frustratingly stiff and gets in the way while you're playing it will have no material effect on the performance of the mouse. The same goes with keyboards, though it's actually even less useful as you keyboard, ideally, shouldn't be moving around as you type, negating any freedom-of-movement benefit from being wireless. But a wired gaming headset tethering your head to your PC is an abomination. Not only are you guaranteed at some point to stand up from desk while wearing your headset and either yank the cable out, bend the plug, or tip over your PC, but you will also hear that cable. You know that sound when the cable's rubbing against your clothes as you move your head around, and it translates into the ear cups strapped to your head? Yeah, you don't get any of that with a wireless headset. So, I'm firmly in the pro wireless headset corner, and this Cyber Monday there are deals on the good, better, best cable-free cans that we recommend as the best wireless gaming headsets. Corsair HS55 Wireless Core | 50 mm drivers | 20 Hz - 20,000 Hz | Closed-back | 2.4 GHz + Bluetooth | $99.99 $54.99 at Newegg (save $45)This is the Core version of our best budget wireless gaming headset, and it's on sale for a price that actually undercuts the wired version right now. The only difference with this Core version and the standard headset is that this one doesn't have iCUE support... which I don't think anyone outside of Corsair is going to miss. Price check: Amazon $54.99 HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless | 50 mm drivers | 15-21,000 Hz | Closed-back | Wireless | $199.99 $124.13 at Amazon (save $75.86)The HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless is one of our all-time favorite gaming headsets for many reasons, but there's a big headline feature to talk about here: 300-hour battery life. No, we didn't make a typo. 300 hours of gaming on a single charge, excellent DTS:X Spatial Audio, and premium comfort features make this headset an absolute stunner of a buy at this price. In fact, when we reviewed it the only major negative we could find was a slightly uninspiring microphone. Absolutely worth a serious look this one, at any level of discount. Price check: Walmart $125.99 | Newegg $144.99 Audeze Maxwell | 90mm planar magnetic drivers | 10 Hz to 50,000 Hz | Wireless | $299.99 $267.73 at Amazon (save $32.28)Well, here it is. The ultimate in wireless audiophile gaming headsets, the Audeze Maxwell makes use of a set of planar magnetic drivers to deliver audio quality that makes reviewers gush the world over. It's a bit heavy, and the software isn't great, but otherwise, this is a symphony of gaming headset luxury—as we found in our 93% review. Price check: Best Buy $299.99 From a pure price per gigabyte metric, these are the best-value SSDs around right now. Now, that doesn't mean they are the absolute best in their capacity class—there are faster drives for not a lot more cash in our regularly updated best Cyber Monday SSD deals page, such as the 1 TB Nextorage NEM-PAB which is up there with the fastest PCIe 4.0 drives, for just $68 at Newegg ($0.068 / GB). But on a pure costing basis, for the amount of storage space you get in return these three drives are the absolute lost price/GB SSDs on sale right now. Team Group MP44L | 1 TB | M.2 2280 | PCIe 4.0 | 5,000 MB/s read | 4,500 MB/s write | $79.99 $54.99 at Amazon (save $25)The MP44L is far from being the fastest SSD you can buy but for the money, you really can't complain. The read/write speeds are pretty low compared to others in our curated list, but they're still fast enough for most users and way better than a SATA SSD. If you avoid using it for heavy data transfers, you'll have no problems with it. Price check: Newegg $54.99 (out of stock) Silicon Power UD90 | 2 TB | NVMe | PCIe 4.0 | 5,000 MB/s read | 4,800 MB/s write | $97.97 $92.97 at Amazon (save $5)You might not know Silicon Power from Samsung, but this SSD is well-received by our friends at Tom's Hardware. It offers plenty of speed for a Steam library expansion but with a meager cost per gigabyte of just four cents. It's not the fastest SSD out there, though. Price check: Newegg $92.97 (out of stock) | $144.99 at B&H Photo (out of stock) Silicon Power UD90 | 4 TB | NVMe | PCIe 4.0 | 5,000 MB/s read | 4,500 MB/s write | $239.99 $189.97 at Amazon (save $50.02)This Silicon Power might not be the fastest of drives, but it's difficult to argue with this much storage for this sort of money. With a sequential read/write of 5,000 MB/s and 4,500 MB/s, it's still not what you'd call slow and should be fine for gaming; plus it comes from a reliable brand. You know what I love most in tech? A piece of kit that punches above its weight class, something that delivers build quality and great value. That's where I am with the Corsair TC100 Relaxed gaming chair. Is it the outright best place to park your butt when gaming? No, those are more expensive. But it is a really, really good chair. And what's more it's still retaining its Black Friday discount being just $180 at Best Buy. And Corsair. And B&H Photo. In fact, it's only not on Amazon because it had a run on the chairs and now it's out of stock, which is the second time in a week that it's gone out of stock at the retailer. Which is the best part of this particular deal. Not only is it a great product, and not only is it available at an unprecedentedly low price, but it's also available at that price in three separate locations, which gives me hope that anyone who wants one has a good chance of being able to buy one at this discounted price. Corsair TC100 | Fabric and leatherette | $249.99 $179.99 at Best Buy (save $70)The TC100 is our favorite affordable gaming chair right now, following up on the popular T3 Rush with a great look and genuine comfort. You can read more in our review. Right now, even with only a light discount, it's a truly excellent gaming chair that's cheaper than most of its competition. Price check: Corsair $179.99 | B&H Photo $179.99 | Amazon $179.99 (sold out) Okay, so it's not specifically a 'deal' but if you're at all interested in VR this is where the smart money goes. The Meta Quest 3S is the best-value gateway to virtual reality, being essentially an updated version of the classic Quest 2 for around the same money. Representing more of a step up, however, is the Quest 3, which ups the ante again for comfort and visuals. I think, even at its $500 price tag, it's a good price for the best VR headset around. So much so, that I bought one for my wonderful big brother's birthday; happy birthday, Rich! 🎁 I would absolutely recommend getting a new head strap, though, because the basic ones are pretty rubbish. Meta Quest 3S | 1832 x 1920 per eye | 72 Hz, 90 Hz, 120 Hz | Inside-out tracking | $299 at AmazonIn our Meta Quest 3S review, we praise this little VR headset's great processor, price, and stable tracking. It is missing a 3.5 mm jack, comes with a lower base storage, and the screen is the same as the second-generation model (which is noticeably worse than the Quest 3) but these are the main places you will notice the over $200 price difference. If you order with the code 'QUEST100' at checkout on December 1, you'll also get a $100 digital credit for Amazon, which is pretty sweet, and the bundle comes with Batman: Arkham Shadow and 3 months of Meta Quest+. Price check: Best Buy $299.99 (doesn't come with digital credit) Meta Quest 3 | 2064 x 2208 per eye | 72 Hz, 80 Hz, 90 Hz, 120 Hz | Inside-out tracking | $499.99 at AmazonWith great tracking, a strong mobile chip, and dual LCD pancake lenses, the Meta Quest 3 is the strongest VR headset the company currently offers. Unfortunately, there is no Cyber Monday sale for it but it's already an impeccably well-valued headset, being the best VR headset for gaming right now. Though not a new offering, buying a Meta Quest 3 also gets you Batman: Arkham Shadow and 3 months of Meta Quest+, Meta's monthly game subscription service. Price check: Best Buy $499.99 There were some outstanding screens on offer over Black Friday, and I'm happy to report that three of our favorite OLED gaming monitors over that time are still on offer over the weekend. They all fill a spot in our Cyber Monday gaming monitor deals hub, and offer different displays for different kinds of gamer. But, crucially, they're all three OLED panels for under $900, which is testament to how the market has developed over the past year. There are two ultrawide monitors, one a 34-incher and the other ultrawiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide, at 49-inches. Then there is my personal favorite, the 32-inch 4K OLED from MSI for $700 at Amazon. That would be where my would go, because I love the 4K OLED I'm using at the moment, and I think it's a great panel. MSI MAG 341CQP | 34-inch | 3440 x 1440 | 175 Hz | QD-OLED | Curved | $779.99 $575.99 at Amazon (save $204)OLED gaming still isn't as affordable as we'd like. But it's getting there. This 34-inch ultrawide QD-OLED beast is still a good deal at this price, however. The 175 Hz refresh is a tiny bit pedestrian, but it's plenty fast enough for us and, in all other regards, this is the full OLED experience, including 0.03 ms response time and serious HDR sizzle. Price check: Newegg $599.99 MSI MAG 321UP | 32-inch | 4K | 165 Hz | QD-OLED | $829.99 $699.99 at Amazon (save $130)What a difference a letter makes... especially when it comes to gaming monitors. The code names given to monitors are often impenetrable, but the difference between this MAG 321UP and the MAG321UPX is that this one has a 165 Hz refresh instead of 240 Hz. That's the only difference between this and the more expensive one. If you're not concerned about the refresh rate difference (and do you have the hardware to hit a matching 240 fps otherwise?) then this is where the smart OLED money is spent. Price check: Newegg $699.99 Gigabyte Aorus CO49DQ | 49-inch | 5120 x 1440 | 144Hz | QD-OLED | Curved | $1,099.99 $899.99 at Amazon (save $200)It's not been around for long but the Aorus CO49DQ already has a decent discount, and it's a lot of monitor for the money as we found in our review. Those rocking the RTX 4090 might be better off with the higher refresh rate of the Samsung Odyssey G9 G93SC, but the rest of us can take advantage of this very wide, very pretty looking panel for a bit less.Price check: Best Buy $899.99 If you want to do a Bane and "go mobile" you could do a lot worse than the handheld gaming PCs still on offer as we come into Cyber Monday. Batman's Bane? Too obscure? Ah, I'm going to run with it. Two of the best gaming handhelds are rocking a hefty discount right now, with the LCD Steam Deck available for a stunningly cheap, almost Nintendo Switch-level price at $337 from Steam. There's also our top pick overall, the ROG Ally X, for $700 at Best Buy right now, and it's older sibling is $485 at Amazon. Those two handhelds essentially use the same APU, so will deliver similar performance, but the Ally X is the better of the two, with a better screen, better cooling, and a much bigger battery. But the old ROG Ally, with the Z1 Extreme chip, was still a good device... so long as you didn't use an SD card with it. They were prone to, erm, breaking. Just make sure you go for the one with the Z1 Extreme chip in it, not the straight Ryzen Z1 chip. That version of the Ally is also on sale for what looks like a good price, but the difference between the two chips is such that I wouldn't want the lower-spec Ally even at its deal price. I'd absolutely go with the Steam Deck over the Z1 Ally. Price watch:➖Steam Deck (LCD) | 512 GB SSD | SteamOS | $449 $336.75 at Steam (save $112.25)Okay, the Steam Deck may have had an OLED refresh and there are heaps of more powerful handhelds around, but the original version is still the archetype of what a mobile PC gaming device should be. It's just as powerful as the most recent model so all those Steam Deck compatible games should run well. It's the OG PC gaming handheld, and it still demands respect. At the very least because SteamOS is wicked and it's extremely affordable with this deal (which goes on until December 4 if you want more time to think). Price watch: 🔽Lenovo Legion Go | Z1 Extreme | 8.8-inch screen | 16 GB RAM | 512 GB SSD | $699.99 $472.97 at Amazon (save $227.02)The Legion Go is one of the more polished handhelds on the market, with a sleek 8.8-inch screen and detachable controllers. That screen is a little overkill for the lil' AMD chip inside this machine, the Z1 Extreme also found in the ROG Ally, but it's great for playing indies on while relaxing. One of the controllers also becomes a mouse if you need it, which is a bit of a gimmick but works pretty well. Price check: Newegg $499.99 | Best Buy $549.99 Price watch: ➖ROG Ally | Z1 Extreme | 7-inch screen | 16 GB RAM | 512 GB SSD | $589.99 $485 at Amazon (save $104.99)The original ROG Ally—still a strong performer even next to its improved sibling, the ROG Ally X. That's because they are both powered by the same Z1 Extreme chip from AMD. Considering the money off the original Ally, there's something to be said for choosing this over the X, though the bigger battery life on the X is definitely a huge improvement. Price check: Best Buy $499.99 Price watch: ➖ROG Ally X | Z1 Extreme | 7-inch screen | 24 GB RAM | 1 TB SSD | $799.99 $699.99 at Best Buy (save $100)The ROG Ally X is a little bit too new to receive a massive discount. However, as our pick as the best handheld gaming PC to buy right now, even a $100 off is worth mentioning. Combining a generous helping of RAM, which really matters with an APU, alongside a 1 TB SSD and awesome form factor, the ROG Ally X is top of the charts for a reason. Price check: Asus $799.99 There are some deals I'm particularly happy about them having survived Black Friday and still being on offer over Cyber Monday and into Cyber Week. This being one of them. I love the Mountain Everest 60 keyboard, and I've played with every enthusiast keeb going, yet this is still the one I come back to. ☝️ That's me cradling my own Everest 60 looking tired because I am still live blogging deals. Over Black Friday it was $40 for Amazon Prime Members, but now it $40 at Amazon for everyone. So, everyone should buy one. Though the older TKL Everest board is also on offer for $40 at the Mountain store, and there's the full-fat Everest Max, with all the wrist rest, numpad, and controller extras included for $80, too. That was a nigh $300 kit when it launched, btw. Mountain Everest 60 | Mechanical | 60% | RGB | $69.99 $39.99 at Amazon (save $30)The Mountain Everest 60 is a perfect example of not having to spend a lot to get a cracking keyboard. Not only does it have hot-swappable switches and RGB, it's also wonderful to type on thanks to a plethora of enthusiast design choices such as great foam dampening, pre-lubed switches, and PBT keycaps. Oh, and you can snap on modular magnetic upgrades down the line, too, such a a numpad. This is the absolute cheapest RTX 4070 gaming laptop I've ever seen. The Lenovo LOQ range of laptops was always meant to be its more budget oriented line of gaming laptops, but they launched at a price that just didn't make sense considering their constraints. But we've seen some good discounts on them over Black Friday, and now this is probably my favorite Cyber Monday gaming laptop deal, and it's not even Monday yet. The miserly 512 GB SSD is pretty Scrooge-like, but aside from that the spec on offer here is outstanding for the money, and will make a fantastic gaming machine for someone. The RTX 4070 is a genuine 115 W version, so a very capable pixel pusher, and I've always been a big fan of Lenovo's laptop keyboards; they the best in the business. It's a win from me. Lenovo LOQ 15ARP9 | RTX 4070 | Ryzen 7 7435HS | 15.6-inch | 144 Hz | 16 GB RAM | 512 GB SSD | $1,199.99 $879.99 at Walmart (save $320)This is the cheapest RTX 4070 gaming laptop I've seen so far this Black Friday/Cyber Monday period. Not only that, but it doesn't entirely suck in other ways. There's a reasonable amount of dual-channel memory and a speedy IPS screen. The 512 GB SSD does, however, suck, but you can easily upgrade it with the spare NVMe slot inside. iBuyPower is currently sitting pretty atop our guide to the best gaming PC you can buy right now, and it's also got a full suite of fantastic offers we've just dropped into our Cyber Monday gaming PC deals hub. We've had its rigs on this list for the super budget RTX 4060 machines over the Black Friday period, but here I want to highlight the more powerful, but still almost affordable gaming PCs it has on discount at the moment. Just don't forget the sneaky BLACKFRIDAY promo code for the big added discounts on the list price you'll see on the iBuyPower site. iBuyPower RDY Slate 8MP 002 | Core i7 14700KF | Nvidia RTX 4070 Super | 32 GB DDR5-6000 | 2 TB SSD | $1,999 $1,399 at iBuyPower (save $600 with code BLACKFRIDAY at checkout)Yes, you can find a cheaper RTX 4070 build right now, but not one that's as well-rounded as this one. With this one, you're getting an up-to-date platform with a fast CPU (ensure it has the latest BIOS, though), 32 GB of fast RAM, and 2 TB of storage. Noice. iBuyPower RDY Y60 005 | Core i9 14900KF | Nvidia RTX 4070 Super | 32 GB DDR5-6000 | 2 TB SSD | $2,299 $1,599 at iBuyPower (save $700 with code BLACKFRIDAY at checkout)This one's for those of you who expect to be doing some serious creative or productivity work alongside your gaming. That's because in addition to the RTX 4070 Super that's the heart of this PC's gaming chops, plus its 2 TB of storage and 32 GB of fast RAM, there's also a hefty 14900KF working as its brain. Make extra sure its BIOS is up to date, and then get churning through any CPU-heavy task you desire. iBuyPower RDY Lancool 005 | Core i9 14900KF | Nvidia RTX 4080 Super| 32 GB DDR5-6000 | 2 TB SSD | $2,799 $2,099 at iBuyPower (save $700 with code BLACKFRIDAY at checkout)Not only is this a great deal on an RTX 4080 Super build at not too far north of $2,000, but it's also an incredibly well-rounded one. We're talking 32 GB of snappy DDR5 RAM, 2 TB of storage (which is the ideal capacity for all but ultra-high-end or budget builds), and, most importantly, a 24-core i9 14900KF. Just make sure the PC's BIOS is up to date to prevent any Intel voltage funkiness. iBuyPower RDY Y70 TI B02 | Core i9 14900KF | Nvidia RTX 4090 | 64 GB DDR5-6000 | 4 TB (2x2 TB) SSD | $3,999 $3,299 at iBuyPower (save $700 with code BLACKFRIDAY at checkout)Here we have something I can only describe as a behemoth, a mighty specimen whose name is overkill. 24-core CPU? Check. Most powerful graphics card on the market? Check. Double the RAM and storage of most expensive gaming PCs? Yep, check that, too. The only downside is this one doesn't come with the screen on the chassis that the Y70 04 above does. But that's a matter of preference anyway, I suppose. We have seen some cheaper RTX 4060-powered gaming PCs over Black Friday, but they're all out of stock right now. There are also cheaper options available right now, but none that have a spec that I'm as confident about as this Yeyian machine. It's another Yeyian Tanto gaming PC, for $750 at Newegg, but comes with the 10-core, 14-thread Core i5 13400F. I know there's been a lot made of Intel's troubles with the 13th and 14th Gen chips, but so long as you get your mobo's BIOS updated (as you should anyways) then there won't be any issue with this impressive budget machine. Yeyian Tanto | Core i5 13400F | RTX 4060 | 16 GB DDR5-5600 | 1 TB SSD | $1,099 $749.99 at Newegg (save $349.01)This isn't the cheapest RTX 4060 gaming PC we've found this sales season, but this is the one that I'd be buying right now. While the other budget systems are similarly sporting last-gen CPUs, the Core i5 13400F is identical to the 14th Gen alternative, and faster than the Arrow Lake chips for gaming. Paired up with an RTX 4060 and 16 GB of relatively quick DDR5 memory makes this a great budget system. One of those new Cyber Monday gaming laptop deals I was talking about is actually the best-value RTX 4070 machine that I think I've ever seen. I've been working all hours over the past week, so my brain might be a little mushy at this point, but I don't remember seeing another RTX 4070 gaming laptop that I'd actually buy at this price point. The HP Victus 16 is just $930 at Best Buy today. Seriously. There's nothing really that sticks out as a big 🚩either. That RTX 4070 seems to be either a 115 or 120 W TGP, so should be pretty damned performant, and you're getting plenty speed 16 GB of DDR5 memory, too. Obviously that 512 GB is going to be an issue down the line, but the Victus 16 has a spare M.2 easily accessible under the rear casing, so you can just drop in a new 1 or 2 TB SSD as and when you need more space. Price watch: NEW DEAL!HP Victus 16 | Ryzen 7 8845HS | RTX 4070 | 16 GB DDR5-5600 | 512 GB SSD | $1,399.99 $929.99 at Best Buy (save $470)This is easily the cheapest RTX 4070 gaming laptop on the list right now, and the cheapest I think I've ever seen one on sale for. The RTX 4070 isn't a super low spec either, and seems to be a 115 W version. The only real concern I have is that the 512 GB SSD will get filled up fast, but there is a second SSD slot easily accessible in the back of the laptop, so is an easy upgrade. The screen isn't super bright, either, but at 300 nits it will be fine unless you're in a bright office or direct sunlight. Right. Let's have it. OLED displays with up to five times better lifespan may be on their way sooner than you think, thanks to a manufacturing breakthrough 'Inspired by wind-sculpted desert rocks' and bestowed with Intel Lunar Lake, the new MSI Claw handhelds might actually be worth a look Intel's new second-gen XeSS 2 upscaling tech with Frame Generation matches Nvidia's DLSS for features and might have the edge on AMD's FSR PC Gamer is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Cyber Monday is ticking towards a close, and Nintendo Switch deals have been flying judging by how many are running out of stock. A lot of the direct discounts on bundles have gone, but there are still some late savings about, including some great deals on Nintendo Switch games. - Quick links- Console deals- Game deals- Accessory deals- Live updates As often with Switch, many of the best deals are in the UK, where you can get a Switch Lite bundle with Animal Crossing: New Horizons and 12 months of Nintendo Switch online down from £199 to £189. You can also get a Switch OLED console alone for £229 at On Buy – super close to the lowest price I've seen. Keep checking our blog below for live updates on the latest Cyber Monday Nintendo Switch games, accessories and console deals as soon as we spot them. And for advice, see our Nintendo Switch vs Switch OLED piece. Most of the bundle deals we're seeing in the US right now are out of stock, but we're checking them regularly and will let you know if any re-appear. This bundle deal is one of the best we've seen this Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend, and while it's out of stock at both Target and Walmart, it keeps coming back every so often. The bundle includes Mario Kart 8 Deluxe + 12 months of Switch online membership, which gets you access to hundreds of games from Nintendo's back catalogue. Price check: $349.99 at Amazon $299.99 at Amazon There's no direct cash saving here, but you get Mario Kart 8 Deluxe thrown in for the normal price of the standard Switch console alone. Price check: $299.99 at Nintendo Save £118.46: This is one of the best OLED deals I've seen as it includes one of Nintendo's best games - Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - and its Booster Course Pass worth £22.49, as well as 12 months subscription to Nintendo Online. Price check: Amazon £429.99 Save £10: This is only £10 off the usual retail price but that's better than nothing right now, considering that Switch deals are selling out pretty rapidly across the UK right now. Save £10 PLUS added value: We rarely see discounts on the Switch Lite model, so any deal no matter how small should be seen as a win. While this deal says it's only £10 off, there is actually plenty more value in this bundle. It includes a download code for Animal Crossing: New Horizons, one of the most popular Switch games played during lockdown, PLUS 12 months of Switch Online included. Save $10 PLUS added value: Again, this might not seem like a very big bundle discount initially, but there is extra value here that you may not notice. You get the Sports bundle + 12 months of Switch Online. A new console is usually £250 on its own, so these are just extra free perks. Save £70: This is a genuinely good deal, that's been running all week, but it's fluctuating quite a bit. Since our last update, the price has increased by £1, but this console deal remains a brilliant price (the lowest was £220 earlier in the week). Price check: Amazon £279 | Argos: £279.99 Save $20: Legend of Zelda is a game that unites the generations like no other, and Link is back in Tears of the Kingdom to defend Hyrule against malevolent forces with new abilities to explore. Target was beating this deal with $30 off on Black Friday. That deal's gone, but this is still one of the best discounts we've seen. Price Check: $52.99 (European version) at Amazon Best UK price: $44.99 at Amazon Save 64%: This is one of the best games on Nintendo Switch, and I scored it 5/5 in my Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review; for this price there's no excuse not to own one of the console's best Metroidvanias. Save $20: This is one of the most popular games right now across all platforms (not just the Nintendo Switch) and it's easy to see why. This new SEGA action-adventure title teams up old Sonic generations to defeat Dr. Eggman and Time Eater in a timeline-saving dash. My favourite is the Pinball challenge in the casino zone. Price Check: $29.99 at Best Buy | $30 at Walmart Save 49%: The successor to last year's mega-hit, FC 24, this new videogame instalment replaces what we all used to know as FIFA, and celebrates one of the world's biggest sports. It's almost half off, which makes it super tempting for football fans. Save $35: One of the most popular video game characters of all time, Sonic the Supersonic Hedgehog is back in this exhilarating adventure across the five Starfall Islands. Price Check: $31.99 at Best Buy | $39.99 at Target SAVE $30: Anime fans will love this one from Bandai Namco. Experience a new adventure as Luffy: search for the Straw Hats and get your crew back together while scouting mysterious islands and dungeons with a twist. The deal on the digital game. Price Check: $47.45 at Amazon Save 57%: Officially licensed for Nintendo Switch, this is a sweet deal on an unsexy but very useful SD card. It has dropped lower before (to $8.99 actually) but this still a marvellous price. Also available discounted at Best Buy in multiple storage sizes. Save 25%: The Turtle Beach Recon 50 is the best value headset for Nintendo Switch from this well-regarded brand. Perfect for online games of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. A lot of the games with the biggest discounts are ones from big TV and movie franchises like Star Wars (33% off the Heritage Pack), Sponge Bob (38% off the Patrick Star Game), Jurassic Park (25% off the Collection) and Transformers (38% off Galactic Trials). There are still Cyber Monday Switch game deals about. Amazon has a whole bunch of big discounts on Sonic games, including 40% off Sonic X Shadow Generations and 38% off Sonic Mania and Sonic Team Racing. Back over in the US, there's little left in terms of deals on consoles, I'm afraid. The best options are the Switch and Switch OLED bundle deals at Nintendo and Amazon. These aren't specifically Cyber Monday deals, but at least you get a game thrown in with the console. At this stage, it's very unlikely that any new deals will appear, so these are likely to be the best options for the rest of Cyber Monday, and even the rest of the year. There will be another window for deals after Christmas, but January sales haven't tended to bring up a lot of Switch discounts. This is another UK Switch OLED Bundle deal that i'd consider. It's not being billed as a Cyber Monday deal, but it's a great price when you consider that it's £10 cheaper than the RRP of the OLED console alone, and you get Super Mario Wonder and 12 months' of Nintendo Switch Online included. In the UK, Cyber Monday is very nearly over, so let's round up what's left at... Very. There are still a couple of bundle deals as well as savings on games. Here's my pick of the best. All of these are at Very, which has tended to be one of the best places for Switch bundle deals in the UK over the past few years. Some of these are specifically flagged as Black Friday deals, so I expect they will end at midnight. Direct savings on Switch consoles are few and far between now as Cyber Monday proceedings creep towards a close. I have noticed this small saving on the standard Switch in grey, though. It's not really a discount to shout about, but it's something at least if you want the console in that colour. Over in the UK, the best price on Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is £44.99 at Amazon and at Currys, a saving of £10. The best Nintendo Switch game deal of all Black Friday and Cyber Monday was The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom for just $39.99 at Target. That deal's now gone sadly, but the next best thing is a saving of $20 on the digital edition of the game at Best Buy. It's still one of the best deals we've seen on a title that continues to top our pick of the best Nintendo Switch games. It's across the US that we're seeing most sold out bundle deals. In the UK there are still some offers available. My favourite is this Nintendo Switch Lite Animal Crossing Bundle, which comes with a 12-month Nintendo Switch Online membership, which gives you access to some fantastic classic games. Get the Switch Lite Animal Crossing bundle for £199 £189 at Argos Should you buy a deal right now if you see it? We'll be honest with you, yes. We've seen stock running out across various bundle deals so if you see something you like, we advise you to go for it. Hello there! Hi there deal hunters! It's Rosie Hilder here, logging on shortly before I finish my shift. I'm gonna have a quick look around to check if any more offers have appeared and I'll be back shortly with my findings. If you like your controllers separate from your Switch display, then another Joy-Con alternative to consider is the NYXI Hyperion Pro. I've personally reviewed this controller (or controllers should I say, since they come in a pair), and it functions exactly the same as official Nintendo Joy-Cons but with a chunkier design, and colour-changing LED lights for that neon gamer aesthetic that we all love. Take a look at my NYXI Hyperion Meteor and NYXI Hyperion Pro reviews for all of the details. Not a big fan of the official Joy-Con controllers that come with your Nintendo Switch? There are plenty of other (and much better) options out there for a more comfortable gaming experience. One of the most popular Joy-Con alternatives is the CRKD Nitro Deck, which is essentially a dock that your Nintendo Switch display slots into. It's classy in black, but also comes in other variants to give your console that retro aesthetic should you choose. The CRKD Nitro Deck is on sale this Cyber Monday for $69.99 $49.99 over at Amazon in the US, and for £37.49 at Amazon in the UK. If you're looking for a fun Nintendo Switch accessory this Cyber Monday, might I recommend this BMO Switch dock from Amazon? Modelled after the loveable Adventure Time character. I own this dock myself and I love it, but it's more of a stand really than a working dock, as there are no slots for connecting peripherals. In other words, it's an excellent stand for keeping your Switch sturdy while you play in tabletop mode, but it's no good for connecting your console to the TV. There are 3 colour options to choose from, Blue, Orange or Pink – and each option is reduced to only $16.73 for Cyber Monday, down from $24.98, saving you $8.25. There are Cyber Monday deals on some fun Nintendo-themed merchandise, including deals on Paladone gifts, collectibles and more. Take a look below at some of my favourite offers: The best Nintendo Switch games under $20, available now. Save 53% Was $39.99, now $18.74 The Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1 features three of PlayStation's best games on Nintendo Switch. Plus this collection features the original Metal Gear and Metal Gear for NES, as well as documentary and other extras. Save 60% Was $49.99, now $19.99 The recently released Just Dance 2025 Edition – Limited Edition has never been priced this low before. This series has been hugely popular ever since release, and a great game to play with the kids on Christmas Day. This Limited Edition comes with cosmetic extras. Save 50% Was $39.99, now $19.99 Being a huge fan of The Karate Kid and retro games it's kind of hard not pass up on this on this deal. Game Mill's new pixel art brawler draws inspiration from classic games like Renegade and Double Dragon, as well as characters and scenes from the films (now a Netflix show). That last games round up was fun, let's see if I can find enough good Switch games under $10? What do you think? Is it possible? I did buy House of the Dead: Remake for $24.99 on Saturday, so maybe it's possible. Challenge accepted. The best Nintendo Switch games on sale for under $40 Getting or have a Nintendo Switch? Then below are my pick of the best games under $40 this Cyber Monday, including some classics, hidden gems and more. I've played these games, so they're recommended personally. (Including the GTA Trilogy that recently received an update that fixes its visuals, bugs and added new features like 'classic lighting mode'.) US readers - if you want a set of Turtle Beach headphones for Nintendo Switch then there are a couple of good dealsI can recommend. While Turtle Beach Recon 50 isn't on offer in the US, two other models are. I've set the deals out below. Turtle Beach make some of the best headsets for gaming, and the widely loved Turtle Beach Recon 50 is on sale for Cyber Monday. Unlike other brands, this affordable headset comes in the Nintendo Switch colours. If you don't want to spend too much on a gaming headset but want quality the Turtle Beach Recon 50 is a good buy. There's 35% off Turtle Beach Recon 50 at Amazon: £19.99 £13.99 Want the free Mario Christmas tree ornament from my previous post? Then I've found the best buys from the Nintendo Store that will take you just over the £70 fresh hold to earn your treat. Free gifts This game isn't on sale but if you buy it now on Cyber Monday it comes with some free Nintendo goodies, including Super Mario Party Jamboree themed Coaster Set, snack bowl and blanket. At £74.49 it just creeps above Nintendo's margin to earn the Mario ornament. The cutely named Alarmo is a clock like no other, it features a digital display that can be programmed to reflect your favourite Nintendo games, and includes Nintendo's unique fonts and 35 themed alarms. It also has sensors to note when you move and are awake. The collector's statue features Link from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and comes with a Sheikah Slate, Ancient Arrow and base that all feature LED functions. The statue us packaged in a collector's box. I just spied Nintendo's free gift! If you spend more than £70 on the Nintendo Store over Cyber Monday you get a free Mario holiday ornament to hang on the Christmas tree. Visit the Nintendo Store and claim your free ornament with orders over £90. The thing I love about Nintendo Switch is its handheld mode - and in all honesty, it's the way most of us play on the console. While I buy a lot of games over the eShop these days, it's still nice to have a collection of physical games, especially when travelling and access to WiFi can be limited. So below I've found the three best Nintendo Switch case deals available right now for Cyber Monday. Each has storage for the console, leads and game cards. Save 24% Was $19.91, now $15.19 at Amazon This case for Nintendo Switch features a protective hardshell outer case, with pockets for spare controllers, cables and a couple of cards. It's water-resistant and designed like an official Nintendo case. Save 40% Was $12.59, now $7.58 at Amazon Every Nintendo Switch owner needs a dedicated game card wallet, and this one from FYY is a good choice and has a whopping 40% off the retail price. It can store 24 game cards and 48 micro SD cards, so you never misplace a game. Save 25% Was $19.99, now $14.99 at Amazon Made from premium materials, including a ballistic outer hardshell case, this is fully licensed and tested by Nintendo for use with all Switch consoles. It even features a viewing stand and comes with extra game cases. This is the #1 selling Switch case in the USA and it's reduced for Cyber Monday. Get Nintendo SwitchSports + Super Mario Party Jamboree + Nintendo Online at Very, for £308.99 £289 (save £19.99). I literally bought the Nintendo Switch Sports bundle last year and now you can get it for less, with Super Mario Party Jamboree included and Nintendo Online added, too. So, of course I'd recommend this deal. If you have kids, nieces and nephews, or grandchildren this is a great bundle as both the included games are designed for the family and multiplayer. (And Nintendo Online offers access to hundreds of free retro games so oldies like me can settle in to a Metroid marathon on Boxing Day.) Hey, it's Ian here now, taking over from Georgia. I'm Creative Bloq's Editor, Digital Art and 3D and spend my time writing about all things, well… digital art and 3D, including game art, game design and reviewing Switch games.In a past life I was editor of Official PlayStation Magazine and have been writing about video games professionally since 1998, when Nintendo, Sony and Sega we're going head to head. But you're here for Nintendo Switch deals, and I'm going to find you some good ones, I promise. After yesterday's deals search I ended up buying House of the Dead Remake for my Switch, so let me just pause it and start the deals search. We're not seeing many Switch deals in the UK, but right now you can bag the Switch Lite for $185, a saving of $15. Which is better than nothing, right? Right? Rumours about the Nintendo Switch 2 have been hotting up for what feels like forever, but it's sounding like the souped-up Switch sequel might finally appear at the start of next year. For every rumour in one place, take a look at our main Nintendo Switch 2 page. You know what I think the best thing is about the Nintendo Switch? You can play Goldeneye on it. The 1997 N64 game has a special place in my heart, as I spent countless hours on it as a wee lad. For decades the only way to play it again was to dust off an old N64, but Goldeneye finally hit Nintendo Switch Online last year. And with that $50 off OLED deal at Walmart, you get 12 months of Nintendo Switch Online thrown in. One of the best deals we've seen this Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend is $50 off the Nintendo Switch OLED bundle featuring Mario Kart 8 and 12 months of Nintendo Switch online. This deal is out of stock at Target, but Walmart has just brought it back, with the bundle down to $299. This one won't be hanging around for long. In previous years we might have suggested holding on before committing to buying a Switch OLED – but in 2024 things are different. With the Switch landscape about to change with the advent of the Nintendo Switch 2 (or is that Switch Pro?) – here's why. Animal Crossing arrived on the Switch at just the right time. With the world plunged into lockdown, this cosy universe offered a welcome break from those unprecedented times, with millions diving head-first into the game. It's still a delight, and right now in the UK, Argos is offering an Animal Crossing bundle with the Switch Lite and 12 months of Nintendo Switch online, down from £199 to £189. In the UK, Amazon is currently offering a renewed Nintendo Switch Lite for £149.99, down from the RRP of £199. Amazon's renewed models are almost as good as brand new. Amazon says these are "inspected, tested and cleaned in accordance with Amazon Renewed requirements to be fully functional." Good morning, Dan here taking over the Nintendo Switch live blog. But first, I'd like to wish a very happy Cyber Monday to all who celebrate. I certainly do – I'm wearing my Cyber Monday jumper and hat as we speak, and was made sure to wish everybody I passed on my commute to the office a friendly 'Cyber greetings'. Now, let's Switch (lol!) to the matter at hand. Since we left you, the Nintendo Switch deals landscape has changed, with old deals dying and new sprouting. I'll be bringing you all the latest info this morning, so keep your eyes peeled on this blog, and the deals information above. Okay gamers, It's just past 1am in the UK right now which means it's officially Cyber Monday! I'm signing off for the night, but stick with us (and this blog) first thing tomorrow to be kept in the loop about any fresh Nintendo Switch Cyber Monday deals as soon as we spot them. One of the worst things about owning a Nintendo Switch is the dreaded Joy-Con drift. I'm sure most Switch gamers have experienced this at some point, or if you haven't, then count yourself lucky. Stick drift is a very common issue where joysticks tend to shift out of place over time, so it's as if your character is moving on its own (or something else is happening on screen) that isn't your doing. There are plenty of newer controllers and joypads on the market that are now swapping out analogue sticks for what's known as hall effect joysticks instead, which promise absolutely zero stick drift. I've put together a guide of the best Joy-Con alternatives full of controllers that will work with your Nintendo Switch console, but never develop stick drift. Thank me later. What else can I tell you about the Nintendo Switch? Probably not much that you don't already know. Although, I did recently learn that you can use a Nintendo Switch with compatible AR Smart glasses. These are essentially wearable monitors that let you experience gameplay on a cinema-sized screen, which would be perfect for situations when you're without a screen or Nintendo Switch dock, like when travelling on a plane. If you're interested, I've rounded up some Cyber Monday deals on Smart Glasses that actually tempted me to buy a pair. Hi guys, it's Beth again 👋 Inspired by Georgia's post below about the Shadow the Hedgehog Lego set, I've found some super cool deals on Mega Blocks Pokémon sets over at Amazon that I think could make excellent stocking fillers for gamers 🎮 These Pokémon sets aren't officially Lego-branded, but instead are classed as MEGA Bloks which is a different brand owned by Mattel. I actually own two of these Pokémon Lego-alternative sets already, the Snorlax and Jumbo Pikachu sets, and they're really fun and challenging to build. You can find a few other options in a previous deals roundup I made a while back. Save 16% Was $58.99, now $49.50 at Amazon Save 38% Was $99.99, now $61.59 at Amazon Save $67 Was $171.99, now $104.99 at Amazon Of course you could always opt for a refurbished Switch if you wanted to save some extra pennies, and think about the environment, too. Most retailers have certified renewed models, often with warranties for a year or more. These are often returned devices that have been wiped clean and spruced up by a very capable tech team. You can even buy these direct from Nintendo and if that doesn't give you peace of mind, nothing will. Find renewed Nintendo Switch Lite consoles for $169, OLED from $319 and the standard Switch from $259.99. I just got stuck in a little hole of looking through the concepts people made back when the Switch 2 was going to be called the Switch Pro (in our heads anyway) and we had NO idea what it would be like, or when it was coming. We covered some of those concepts in news pieces. The first is a render made by Zone of Tech: We see what they did there. Kinda like a Lite but with zingier colours. And isn't this one delightful? I'd totally buy a purple Switch, though I know that's not the point at all. That screen looks like it's hiding some gorgeous graphics. I love how casually Nintendo announced the Switch 2. Just a little tweet, that's all it took to announce the biggest development in gaming handhelds, and one we were waiting for for years! Read all about the announcement here. Would I still recommend buying the Switch in the light of the news? Well, yes actually I would. But only the OLED and the Lite. I don't think there's a point in buying the standard console, unless you're on a very tight budget. Give it's eight years old I think you'd be better off spending a bit more to get the OLED Switch. And if I'm really honest I think they might discontinue that original one next year to realign the range. I remember back in 2021, an engineer made a GIANT Nintendo Switch. It was incredible. And that is how big the Switch looms in my brain after the whole weekend deal hunting. It was a fully working Switch that was 650% larger than a normal console! That means it was 70 inches wide and 30 inches tall... and it weighted an epic 29.5kg. It even had a 4K display. Pretty amazing if you wanted a cinema-like Nintendo Switch experience, eh? Read all about the giant Switch here. And watch the video below! There's also a really nice Mario Wonder OLED bundle deal at Argos if you're in the UK. You can get the OLED console plus the Super Mario Bros. Wonder game and that great Switch Online membership I've been banging on about for £289.99. There's a lot of added value here that could make it a viable alternative to that other UK deal from On Buy. If you're wanting a game to play, in fact hundreds of games, then this is the one for you. You'll only end up spending about that much on a similar amount of content if you go for a standalone console. I've just found a brilliant non-Switch deal I actually want to tell you about. We've recommended the sale price on the Sonic X Shadow Switch game above, but what about a Shadow the Hedgehog Lego set?! Target has got a stellar 30% off that set right now, saving you $21 and bringing it to $48.99. It's a really fun Shadow the Hedgehog head – and is the perfect gift for a Sonic fan (or yourself). You could build it then look admiringly at it while playing the associated game on your brand new Switch! There's a plan. Not totally sure how to use the Switch to its fullest capabilities? We've put together some handy tips and tricks for you to boost your gameplay. 12 pointers, in fact. From how to save battery life to customising your home screen, there are a bunch of useful ideas here for optimising your experience with the Switch. Find out our 12 tips for getting the most out of the Switch. If you've got this far you're likely to know which console you want. But if you're on the fence, or you're finding it hard to match your gaming priorities with your budget, then you'll want to read some stellar advice, I expect. For example, might it be worth dropping under the $200/£200 mark to get the Switch lite? If you're happy to keep your console in hand rather than play as a group through your TV then that might be a compromise you're willing to make. Are you happy with a slightly older, less flashy model? You could possibly be satisfied with the standard Switch console. Read 7 things to consider before buying a Switch here, and learn all about it. Hiya! It's Editor Georgia back again for an evening of deal hunting. I'm seeing so many standout deals sold out now, or returning to the usual price. This could mean an influx of new deals is set to drop – or it could be game over for Switch deals. In my experience, the kind of deal we saw this year (namely that $275 bundle deal that's now back to $349) will be limited. Not that I have much experience of that becuse normally there is very little to work with. But my guess it that that brilliant deal is over now because it would have been so popular! But I'll be happy to be wrong on this occasion. If tomorrow dawns and there are a whole host of new deals I'll be delighted to share them. It is worth noting that Amazon didn't take part in that big price slash. while Best Buy, Target AND Walmart did... Could the retail giant have something up its sleeve for tomorrow? If you're looking for some creative Nintendo stocking fillers in time for Christmas this year, we have a guide to the best Nintendo Stocking fillers for the gamers in your life. I really want the Lego Piranha Plant for my desk at home, and I think it would make an amazing gift for anyone wanting a unique office accessory (who needs a real houseplant when you have this?). There are tons of other options in the guide to suit a range of ages and budgets, so be sure to check it out if you need a gift to go along with your Nintendo Switch console purchase. One final accessory I'm recommending for any new Nintendo Switch owners is a case. If you don't already have one, then it's important to get a reliable case for your console to keep your Nintendo Switch display scratch-free, and keep out dust, plus you can also store your cartridges in most cases for safekeeping. The one I have is a leather Snorlax case which I bought on Amazon from a seller named PALPOW, but I think it's currently unavailable in the US and UK. Don't fret, here are five other Nintendo Switch cases that I would recommend below. • PowerA Protection Case • GeekShare Plush Protective Case • PALPOW Mario Switch Case • HORI Premium Vault Case • Tomtoc Switch Lite Case Need a dock for your Nintendo Switch? Cyber Monday is a great time to shop for Switch accessory deals, and we have a guide to the best Nintendo Switch docks to help you out. A docking station is one of the most essential Nintendo Switch accessories, and is compatible with both the standard Switch and Switch OLED models (but not the Switch Lite). I think it's fair to assume that plenty of you reading this will have experienced the dreaded Joy-Con drift (I know I have). If you're hoping to avoid that this Cyber Monday, then definitely take a look at the handy guide I put together on tried and tested Nintendo Switch Joy-Con alternatives that promise absolutely zero stick drift. The pair I own is the NYXI Hyperion Pro, and not only are these controllers gorgeous to look at with colour-changing LED but they operate in the exact same way as official Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons and even have motion controls too. Take a look at my NYXI Hyperion Pro review for all of the details. Keeping with the Pokémon theme, did you know that SanDisk has official Pokémon SD cards for the Nintendo Switch? There's a yellow Pikachu 256GB card, a Gengar 512GB card, and a Snorlax 1TB card which was on sale at Amazon for $134.99 $89.99 during Black Friday (I think this deal has sold out sadly) but you can get it dscounted at Amazon in the UK for £79.99 down from £127.99. My favourite game to play on my retro Nintendo 64 console is Pokémon Snap (maybe that's why I grew up to become a photographer 🤔), and this game was so popular back in the day that they remade it for the Nintendo Switch! The New Pokémon Snap (Nintendo Switch version) is on sale at Amazon right now for $59.99 $49.95, saving you $10 – and I highly recommend it if you love Pokémon games. You need to use your sharp eye to spot Pokémon in their natural habitat doing something interesting and snap a photo to earn a score. It's more fun than it sounds I promise. My first ever Nintendo console was the N64, which was passed onto me by my older brother when I was about 4 years old. I still have it today, and it sits proudly on my gaming shelf with a copy of Pokémon Stadium. I can't believe how expensive it is now to buy a Nintendo 64, although it is considered one of the best retro consoles ever. There are no Cyber Monday deals on the Nintendo 64 (obviously) but if you do fancy a hit of nostalgia you can pick one up for $110 at Amazon, or at Walmart for $114.95, which is actually a much better price than options I've been seeing on sites like eBay and Etsy. Hey gamers, Beth here! I thought I'd quickly introduce myself as I'll be taking over the blog for a while. I've owned my Nintendo Switch console since 2017, and I absolutely love it. I'm a huge Pokémon fan, but my favourite game to play right now is Disney Dreamlight Valley, as it's super chill and I love getting to unwind at the end of the day and complete tasks in my own Disney village. Beth is our Ecommerce Writer, and loves all things tech and gaming. She owns a PlayStation 5, Meta Quest 3, and Nintendo Switch, plus she used to work at a retail games store, so knows everything there is about the best Nintendo Switch prices and trade-in deals. Not to mention, she has a Snorlax tattoo, so if that doesn't scream Nintendo nerd we don't know what does. If you're looking for a Nintendo gift and a good deal, then the official Nintendo store is a good place to start. The online store features deals on games and Nintendo Switch consoles but it also sells branded gifts, accessories and merchandise. Below are some of my favourites: Balatro Special Edition is £24.99 £18.99 at Amazon, and I'm surprised. Balatro has been one of the year's more unusual games, but it's also one of the most awarded - and it's in the running to be crowned Game of the Year at the prestious The Game Awards held later this month. What is Balatro? It's an indie card game that mixes poker and and tactical card battling, and it's one of the most addictive games of 2024. When I started blogging about Nintendo Switch Cyber Monday deals today I really didn't expect Balatro to be on sale. The idea one of the biggest games of 2024 is reduced is, well… surprising. But then I did a little research, and it has been reduced before, but never to this low a price. The one thing better than finding a deal on a great Nintendo Switch game is finding a deal on a collector's edition. I rarely but collector's edition because they cost so much but on Cyber Monday you can often find a bargain. These special collector's editions include the game but also models, unique boxes and unique extras - they make great gifts. Below I've picked three of my favourite Nintendo Switch game collector's editions, some games are old but the bundles are good (and the best games remain classics and playable long after release - in fact some can be found on the best retro game consoles). Save 29% Was £84.99, now £59.99 at Amazon I grew up on the Turrican series, first playing it on Amiga, and while you can play it on AntStream Arcade, this collection for Nintendo Switch is a wonderful way to discover the classic shooters. This collector's edition features both Volume 1 and Volume 2, which includes every game released, plus an art book, documentary film, posters, stickers, soundtrack and more, all packaged in a designer box. Save 30% Was £49.99, now £34.99 at Amazon Spelunky HD os the remastered version of the breakout indie game that scooped numerous awards on release, and remains a fantastic game. It was originally made usinf GameMaker, the indie game engine. This collector's edition includes the Spelunky HD (which offers 3D or pixel art modes) as well as a specially designed box and art, with a figurine, level guide, soundtrack and more. The Spelunker HD Deluxe - Collector's Edition is limited to 1,300 editions. Save 5% Was £150.23, now £142.75 at Amazon The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom original soundtrack is one of the most popular and beautiful OSTs in gaming, and this collector's edition matches the music. It features 344 songs across nine CDs and comes with a collectible sword-shaped USB and it's all packaged into a striking designer box. Okay, it's not a game, but Zelda fans will adore this edition. Gifting online store IWOOT is a treasure trove of Nintendo goodies, present ideas and just weird rarities I never knew I wanted. There are small savings across the board on many of these collectibles, and it's well worth a look if you're struggling for a gift to buy the Ninty-fan in your life (or for you). The deals include £5 off Super Mario Monopoly £35.99 £30.99; it's the classic board game with added Mario. IWOOT also has Mario water bottles, Mushroom alarm clocks, Nintendo Christmas sweaters, Mario notebooks and mugs. I've just found some of the best Nintendo gifts on Etsy for any retro gamers reading this. A number of sellers have discounts on some eye-catching art prints, including Pop Art style illustrations of iconic Nintendo controllers. Below I've listed my favourites. If you're buying lots of games for Nintendo Switch then you'll need a good microSDXC card to store games and save data. There are some good deals on SanDisk cards for Switch, including Nintendo branded cards, this Cyber Monday, I've listed the best three below: Save 18% This is one of the best cards around, the SanDisk 512GB Extreme microSDXC card is now £42 £35 at Amazon, and it comes with a card reader too. There's also a deal on a two-pack bundle of 64GB SanDisk Extreme cards with a card read, now £28.98 £17.98 at Amazon. Save 15% This SanDisk card comes with Nintendo's branding, which means it's been tested by Nintendo to meet its high standards. This SanDisk 256GB card is now £21.99 £18.68 at Amazon. Save 17% This was £5 cheaper last Tuesday but it's rarely reduced below its RRP all year. This SanDisk card is another one tested and branded by Nintendo for Switch, and comes with the Animal Crossing leaf branding. This Animal Crossing SanDisk card is now £45.99 £37.99 at Amazon. I own a Switch original flavour, from way back, and even though it's brilliant and has saved me on some really dull flights (and post Christmas dinner slump) I'm toying with the idea of buying a Switch OLED today. I don't need a Switch OLED but it's a model the gamer in me wants - we're completists, right? We need the full collection. I've listed the best deal I'd buy / may buy… okay, will buy this Cyber Monday. This is coming home with me. Okay, I don't really want Super Mario Bros. Wonder but my nieces love Nintendo platformers, so I get my Switch OLED and they get a treat. The bundle costs £289.99 at Argos, and considering the OLED alone is £280 at Currys, this is a good deal. Add in a subscription to Nintendo Online, which as I shared earlier is really an entry into Nintendo's back catalogue of hundreds of retro games, deals, voucher offers and more, and this Argos deal is actually incredible value. One neat deals trick Nintendo Switch owners have long made use of that new owners need to know is the Nintendo Vouchers deal. Nintendo Online subscribers can buy two game vouchers for $99.98 / £84, to spend in the eShop on select games. The hack is games cost $59.99 / £49.99 so you're actually making a saving of around 25%. The best games in the voucher deal include: • Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition• The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom• Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door• Princess Peach: Showtime!• Pikmin 4 UK readers can buy vouchers here. It you're thinking of buying a Nintendo Switch in the Cyber Monday sales I'd urge you to sign-up for a Nintendo Online subscription. You can trial three months for free before signing up, but a subscription offers access to hundreds of classic games from Nintendo and Sega, including games released for SNES, Mega Drive, N64 and more. Nintendo regularly updates the list of retro games with new entries, such as Banjo-Tooie, and Sega has just added more to its collection. You can now even play classic game soundtracks with the Nintendo Music app (see below). Find out more on the Nintendo website. Even Nintendo Switch games that only just released can be found with small discounts for Cyber Monday. Below I've listed some eye-catching offers on brand new games, including the adorable The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom and the Tomb Raider Remastered Trilogy, which I bought at launch and comes highly recommended (the final three games release 14 Feb next year in the Tomb Raider IV-V-VI Remastered bundle). To start things off, let's get personal. Not too personal, we don't know one another that well, but below I've found deals on three of my favourite Nintendo Switch games that I play regularly and come highly recommended. At full price these are great, with money off they're even better. Save $32 There's a massive 62% off one of my favourite games on Switch and one of the best Metroidvanias for the console, now just $17.97 at Amazon. Read my Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review. Save $20 Now $59.99 $39.99 at Best Buy. This charming tactical-puzzler in which you guide an army of adorable creatures over obstacles and battles is one of the most original series on Nintendo Switch. Save $20 Another reduced from $59.99 to $39.99 at Best Buy, and it remains one of the console's hidden gems. A platforming classic with a weird sense of humour, you'll love this. Hey deal hunters, it's Ian Dean here, Creative Bloq's Editor, Digital Arts & 3D, I'll be tracking down all the big offers and latest discounts for you on all Nintendo Switch consoles, games and fun stuff.I've been gaming since I could crawl and have been writing about games professionally since 1998, in a past life I sat opposite the Official Nintendo Magazine team has they argued over which Mario game is the best. As I sit here I literally have Metroid Prime Remastered on pause - my own personal Black Friday Switch treat. We're not 'switching' over to Cyber Monday deals, and there can often be some late offers on Nintendo games, accessories and collectibles as we head to the sales end. Stay with me, and we'll find some bargains. This morning has been a wild ride, my friends. I'm about to head off (apparently, I have a family and hobbies and shopping and clothes to wash who knew), but I wanted to alert you to a big Best Buy deal on my colleague Kimberly's favourite game: The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Legend of Zelda is a big obsession for many of my friends, and if like Kimberly, you want to get all 1001 korok seeds, hurry up: she's up to 982. Wake up Demon Slayer fans! I have Cyber Monday goody news for you, because Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles for Switch is a big ol' $20 off on Amazon now, down to a equal-to-lowest-ever $39.99, from $59.99. It's overwhelmingly well reviewed, and looks gorgeous too, so get going before it's out of stock, my beautiful cherubs. Right, while I get some coffee and find the next deal to highlight, please enjoy this new Mario Kart theme from my current content-creator obsession, Carter Vail. Fret not, my American brethren, I haven't forgotten you. I have a sister in Denver, after all. For you, and just you, my beautiful, smart, funny and charming readers, I have found this lowest-ever price for the officially licensed PDP Switch controller. The wireless model is usually $54.99, but for Cyber Monday, it's been knocked down to $49.99, which is the lowest it's ever been. I've got the PDP controller for my PC (Xbox spec), and I absolutely love it. It works fantastically and looks beautiful too, so I have no doubt that the Switch one is as high-quality as that one. There's also a wide selection of colours, so you can find one to fit your interior decor to a tee. If, like me, you prefer a 'classic' controller rather than the Nintendo joy-cons, you're probably browsing for some nice Switch controller deals. And there's quite a few available. Perhaps the best-looking one is this Switch-themed controller from well-liked maker Cehensy, and it's a nice 20% off, down to only £17.58 (while it's still in stock, that is, controllers go out of stock real fast). I've used Cehensy controllers in the past, and based on the ones I've used, as well as customer reviews of this one, this controller is an excellent value deal. It's wireless too, which is always nice... I like games, let's find more games deals. The rather fantastic EA Sports FC 25 is almost half-price on Amazon UK right... now. We have played FC 24 to oblivion in this household and considering the reviews for the new'un, this might be the offer that compels me to get this one. My favourite feature in FC 24 was the Career mode, and that's carried over and further developed in FC 25, where you can develop your own superstar in the dog-eat-dog world of professional association football. Listen up, UK deal hunters. Finding big discounts on Switch consoles is always hard, but there is real value to be found in bundle deals. And I've found one I particularly like this morning (maybe it's because I'm trying to get fit so I've starting cycling at lunch and stuff), which puts the Switch Neon Red & Blue, Sports & Nintendo Switch Online 12 Month Membership all in one handy package for only £249 at Currys, down from £259. Seeing as the standalone unit costs £250 all on its lonesome, this constitutes A Good Deal if you ask me. I know Nintendo is the Realm of Mario, but I've always loved a bit of Sonic the Hedgehog, and right now, there's not one, not two, but THREE Cyber Monday deals on Sonic games at Amazon. So if you, and your 8-year-old son (like mine, incidentally), are both Sonic nutters, why save $20 off one Nintendo Switch Sonic game, when you can save a combined $41.25 on three of them? I haven't played Frontiers myself, but massively enjoyed Superstars and Sonic X Shadow Generations (my kid is a big Shadow fan), so these offers all get the thumbs up from us two experts. Morning, it's Tech Reviews Editor Erlingur here, I'll be escorting you through the magical kingdom of Nintendo Switch deals for the next couple of hours. As someone who has loved Nintendo ever since encountering Super Mario and Duck Hunt with my first NES wayyyyy back in 1989, I'm looking forward to this time with you. Usually, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are a frustrating hunting ground for Nintendo Switch deals (we've got a six-year track record of striving to find gems in the often-barren desert), but this year seems different, with lots and lots of great deals on consoles and games alike. And I've already spotted a verrrrry nice one... For UK Switch fans, we've been highlighting the same deal all week – this one that puts it at (currently) £228 at OnBuy. It's been changing in price a bit - the lowest we saw was £220 and it has gone up to £232 so don't be surprised to see it either sell out or get more expensive. If you'd prefer Amazon, you'll need to pay a bit extra - the OLED console is currently £274. Surprisingly for Amazon, there haven't been oodles of Switch deals on consoles. But the giant has had some great game deals, and accessories too which we will keep you posted on. WHO WILL WIN THE RACE for the lowest price? See what I did there with the Sonic image below? Great. Nintendo Switch OLED Model: Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Bundle: $349 $275 at Target So. What have we got? Well, we've got a fabulous bundle deal from Target, which sets the Switch OLED at a record-low price of $275 BUT THAT'S NOT ALL. That deal has $79 of added value in the form of Mario Kart Deluxe 8 and 12 months of Nintendo Switch Online membership. So actually you're getting total savings of $144. What do you get with that membership? You get access to hundreds, yes hundreds of titles in Nintendo's back catalogue, plus some Sega titles too. I absolutely love retro games (the day they veered from platform gaming was a sad one for me, I don't have the spatial awareness) and so this is a real pull for me. If I was in the US I'd grab this deal immediately. It's in and out of stock at Target, and available in store only at best Buy. Get a taster of the game below: And we're off on yet ANOTHER Nintendo Switch live blog - our fifth year of blogging and my sixth of covering Nintendo Switch sales. I say this to let you know you're in the best possible hands here. We'll be sharing all our expert advice and insider knowledge on whether the deals you see are genuinely worth your time, and to let you know when to pull the trigger (press the mouse? trackpad? It's been a long weekend) on that deal you've been eyeing up. I'm really not exaggerating when I say that the Nintendo Switch deals we've seen this year have been the best I've ever seen during Black Friday. They're so good I was actually surprised. But they are going in and out of stock, so it's important to grab one where you can. Okay stand by and we'll get into this for real. Here's a picture of Mario as an elephant. Just because I can.

Title: Nov 30 ends rare Meta Ray-Bans deal for $149 on Amazon

Among the most popular tech products of 2024, the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses have been the surprise hit. Amazon is offering the version with the classic black frames for $239 (20% off the $299 retail price). This is an especially excellent deal when you consider that many styles of the Meta Ray-Bans were often out of stock for much of the first half of 2024 -- and the smart glasses have rarely been discounted. A lot of the appeal is the fact that they look just like normal Ray-Bans, and you can even replace the lenses with your own glasses prescription. Also: The best Cyber Monday deals: Live updates The caveat to keep in mind here is that Amazon sells eight different styles of the Meta Ray-Bans, and it's the classic black frames with green tinted lenses that are on sale for the lowest price. Other styles cost $30 to $80 more. For example, if you want to wear these smart glasses both inside and outside, then you can get a pair with transition lenses. Those normally retail for $379, but Amazon is offering them 20% off, for $303. I tried the Meta Ray-Bans earlier this year and was much more impressed than I expected. First, to be clear, they are augmented reality glasses, but they're audio-only, so there's no screen overlaid on the lenses. All the feedback comes through the speakers that down-fire into your ears and are hidden in the arms of the glasses. Also: Why Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses are my favorite tech purchase this year I was also pleasantly surprised by the audio quality. For phone calls and conference calls and for listening to podcasts and audiobooks, the sound is nearly as bright and clear as a pair of AirPods or other quality earbuds. For listening to music, movies, or shows with lots of bass and surround sound effects, the Meta Ray-Bans are acceptable but not nearly as robust as a pair of high-end headphones from Apple, Sony, Bose, and others. And because of the open concept, naturally the Meta Ray-Bans can't offer the kind of noise cancellation that you get from AirPods Pro or the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds, for example. All in all, the sound of the Meta Ray-Bans is similar to what you get from the AirPods Pro in transparency mode. But, the Meta Ray-Bans can also do things that no headphones can do. They have a built-in 12-megapixel ultrawide camera for taking photos and capturing videos. This camera is about the same quality as an iPhone 12 or a Samsung Galaxy S20. It only takes photos and videos in portrait mode, but it's far faster to tap the button on top of the right arm of the glasses than it is to pull your camera out of your pocket. The Meta Ray-Bans also have a built-in AI assistant that you can trigger by saying "Hey Meta," and use the large language models that Meta has been furiously building over the past several years. For basic information searches, it works well and is another nice option for leaving your phone in your pocket. The battery life is about a half-day with moderate use, but you can quickly charge to about 50% with 20 minutes in the included case. The case itself charges via standard USB-C, which is nice. You can nearly double the battery by turning off the "Hey Meta" listening feature -- which I did. Meta also regularly rolls out software updates that bring new functionality to the Meta Ray-Bans. For example, during 2024 the Meta Ray-Bans added the capability of translating from Spanish to English in real time and the ability to do a visual search to identify landmarks or translate street signs. And Meta says it will continue to add new features such as helping you remember things you've seen, like your parking spot. Also: The best Apple deals for Cyber Monday 2024 If you're concerned about the way Meta handles privacy -- as many of us are -- the good thing about the Meta Ray-Bans is that they don't require a Facebook account. While they do require a Meta account, you can at least ostensibly keep them separate from your Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp data. That makes it easier for me to recommend the product from a privacy perspective. Don't get me wrong, the AirPods Pro 2 are available for a great deal at $153 ($97 off) for Black Friday and Cyber Monday. But the Meta Ray-Bans can do nearly all that the AirPods Pro can do and more. And since smart glasses are getting more and more common and the promise of smarter AI-powered features are on the horizon, getting a pair of Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses gives you a better chance of getting a taste of the future. Deals are subject to sell out or expire at any time, though ZDNET remains committed to finding, sharing, and updating the best product deals for you to score the best savings. Our team of experts regularly checks in on the deals we share to ensure they are still live and obtainable. We're sorry if you've missed out on a deal, but don't fret -- we constantly find new chances to save and share them with you on ZDNET.com.

We then pore over massive spreadsheets by hand and pick the best of the best deals. Samsung's S90D (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the best TVs you can buy right now, offering vivid yet naturalistic colors, class-leading brightness, and near-infinite contrast and perfect black levels that make OLED TVs so gobsmacking to gaze at. Outside its stellar performance, you’ll get a loaded suite of gaming features, including four HDMI 2.1 inputs for advanced gameplay, a dedicated game bar, and Samsung's Game Hub to stream from services like Xbox Game Pass. The one notable drawback for all Samsung TVs is their lack of Dolby Vision HDR, which is more prevalent than Samsung’s dynamic alternative, HDR10+. Even so, I’d happily have this stylish beauty as my primary display, offering picture quality that’s among the best I’ve seen all year at its best price yet. —Ryan Waniata Sony’s Bravia 9 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best-performing backlit TV around. It blends next-gen brightness with Sony’s proprietary dimming and picture processing to provide stunningly balanced performance across the board. The TV’s brightness pushes toward the psychedelic when called upon, but with measured dispersal to keep from blowing your eyeballs out. On the other end, you’ll experience OLED-like black levels and contrast, and 4K detail that pops off the screen. Sony only offers two HDMI 2.1 ports, meaning you’re losing two slots for gaming consoles over competitors, and the TV’s off-axis viewing is good, not great. That’s the price you’ll pay for brilliance that outdoes even the most fiery OLED displays. If you’ve been looking for a good sale on the best LED TV out there, your search is over. —Ryan Waniata The price of Sony’s impressive Bravia 7 TV (7/10, WIRED Recommends) has sunk like a stone. I took points off the score for its poor off-axis performance, but if you’re watching mostly from straight on, this TV rocks. You’ll get stunning clarity and detail, excellent brightness, vibrant quantum dot colors, and deep black levels thanks to the same algorithm that helps Sony’s Bravia 9 TV look so good. Like all of Sony’s premium TVs, the Bravia 7 offers only two HDMI 2.1 ports, limiting your options for high-performance gaming when compared to some of the best TVs in its class. Otherwise, this is a sweet screen for hundreds less than its inflated launch price. —Ryan Waniata Hisense's 65-inch U7N QLED TV (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our choice as the best TV for most people right now, thanks to its impressive performance and features for the money. The TV’s swarm of mini LED backlights serve up fiery brightness and deep black levels with minimal light bleed, meaning the picture looks great in the daylight and the dark. It’s got great gaming features, including VRR (variable refresh rate) for gaming at up to 144 kHz from its high-refresh panel, and an intuitive Google TV smart system to run the show. Videophiles will likely notice some dirty screen effect—this is a value model after all—and like nearly all backlit TVs, its off-axis viewing is just OK. Still, there’s little to complain about in this well-balanced package, serving up big 4K thrills at a crazy-low price. —Ryan Waniata If you’re after a solid screen at a sweet price, Roku’s baseline Plus Series could be right up your alley. It all starts with the fantastic Roku operating system that makes it remarkably simple to call up connected devices, grab any app, and even track down your remote with a built-in chime. Frankly, that last feature is so fundamental I can’t believe it isn’t standard in all modern TVs. The Plus Series’ panel only offers a 60-Hz refresh rate, so it’s not the best option for serious gamers, but it’s a solid performer thanks to good brightness and punchy colors. Thanks to local dimming, you won’t see blotchy patches when the lights are down, either. Support for Apple Homekit, Alexa, and Google Assistant rounds out the package for a great budget buy. —Ryan Waniata For those looking to see the blaze of summer in the dead of winter, Hisense’s 65-inch U8N TV serves up stunning brightness that nearly doubles many TVs in its price class. All that power doesn’t come at the cost of contrast, as the TV provides excellent black levels with minimal light bleed, alongside vivid quantum dot colors to let you bask in its sizzling punch in any lighting. You’ll also get the latest gaming features, a breezy Google TV interface, and every major flavor of HDR. The off-axis viewing isn’t anything to write home about, but this TV feels more premium than it has a right to for under $1,000. Looking to go bigger? The 75-inch version is still reasonable at $1,300, or you can go nuclear with the 85-incher for $300 more. —Ryan Waniata Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Apple’s latest iPad Mini (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with several internal upgrades. With an A17 Pro chip, it can handle both graphically demanding games and Apple Intelligence (the company’s suite of artificial intelligence features) with ease. It also has support for the feature-packed Apple Pencil Pro. All of this is packed into a tiny build that’s great for traveling with—whether you’re using it for gaming or reading ebooks. —Brenda Stolyar This is the latest Apple Pencil to join the lineup. Unlike the 1st and 2nd-gen versions, it comes with a “squeeze” capability that triggers the tool palette (you can use double-tap as well) and a haptic engine that delivers feedback when you squeeze the stylus. The built-in gyroscope sensor also allows you to change the orientation of each tool as you twist it, giving you finer control. It’s only compatible with the iPad Air (M2), iPad Pro (M4), and iPad Mini (A17 Pro). —Brenda Stolyar The iMac with M4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with a few notable upgrades, including a 12-megapixel webcam with support for Center Stage, the option to add a nano-texture display, and the accessories now come with USB-C ports. Powered by the latest M4 chip, it delivers great performance too. It’s currently our favorite desktop in our guide to Best All-in-One Computers. —Brenda Stolyar This MacBook Air (9/10, WIRED Recommends) with M1 is the cheapest MacBook you can buy. Although the M1 came out back in 2020, it’s still a speedy and capable chip for simple tasks and basic activities (like web browsing, sending emails, and word processing) along with light video editing. It also has solid battery life and will easily last you an entire day. It’s a good option if you’re looking for a reliable MacBook without breaking the bank. —Brenda Stolyar Apple recently launched the M4-powered versions of the MacBook Pro, but the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) remains a great option. It has a bright display with mini-LED and a 1080p webcam built in. You’ll also get a 120-Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling. As usual, it packs plenty of ports, including two USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 4, an HDMI, a MagSafe charging port, an SD card slot, and a high-impedance headphone jack. We recommend it if you don’t want to spend over $2,000 on a MacBook Pro. —Brenda Stolyar This is one of our top picks in our guide to Best MacBook Accessories. The low-profile keys are satisfying to type on, while the slim and lightweight build is easy to travel with for those who like to take their peripherals on the go. It mimics the MacBook keyboard too, complete with a Do Not Disturb key and the option to program the function row key with Apple’s own apps like Keynote, Final Cut Pro, Safari, and more. It’s only available with tactile quiet switches, though. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite keyboard case for iPads. The first half protects the back of the iPad and also comes with a kickstand while the second half has a detachable keyboard and trackpad. The case is not only durable and sturdy but also feels great to type on. Instead of Bluetooth, it connects using Apple’s Smart Connector so you don’t have to worry about draining battery life. It’s available for the base iPad (7th, 8th, and 9th Gen) along with the iPad Air (5th Gen and M2) and 11-inch iPad Pro (1st Gen and newer), 12.9-inch iPad Pro (5th and 6th Gen), as well as the 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro with M4. —Brenda Stolyar Logitech's Casa Pop-Up Desk (9/10, WIRED Review) is a great solution for those who constantly work on the go but prefer using an external keyboard and mouse with your laptop. Instead of carrying all those accessories around, the Casa Pop-Up Desk includes a keyboard and trackpad that fit neatly into a compact case that doubles as a laptop stand. It’s expensive, but it’s worth it if you’re always working out of the house. —Brenda Stolyar This is a great accessory if you want to use your iPhone as a webcam. Thanks to a feature called Continuity Camera, you can use your iPhone as a webcam for a MacBook (you can check out these instructions for how to set it up). The circular silicone puck magnetically connects to your iPhone (it also doubles as a kickstand or phone grip), and there’s a section that pops out so you can mount the iPhone on top of a MacBook. Since it utilizes the rear camera, the Belkin allows for a more natural video-calling experience and better image quality than the standard MacBook webcam. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This Bluetooth-connected portable board finally got my 7- and 9-year-old interested in chess. The pieces feel wonderfully matte and heavy to play with. It connects to the GoChess app on your phone, which is integrated with Lichess and Chess.com. You can play against other people or get AI-enabled suggestions in person, and the board lights up to guide you. My kids will pick up pieces and discuss moves for hours. It's great.—Adrienne So A firm WIRED favorite and one of the best family board games, Ticket to Ride features steam engine styling and rules that are easy to grasp. All you must do is claim railway routes across the US and Canada using your colorful plastic rail cars. Spend cards to claim routes, rack up bonus points for connecting specific destinations, and the person with the highest score at the end wins. All aboard, choo, choo! —Simon Hill If your kid is learning how to ride a bike, a Guardian bike is not that much more expensive than a big box store bike, and it weighs around 10 pounds less. Guardian's proprietary SureStop brake system which means the rear wheel will always brake before the front wheel, so your kid will never flip over. It works. I gave my kid's bike to a 20-year-old ding-dong to test in an empty parking garage, and he couldn't flip it.—Adrienne So Inspired by the Royal Palace of Evora in Portugal, with its Moorish blue-and-white ceramic tiles, this board game challenges you to make mosaics by matching tiles with different patterns and colors to amass the maximum possible score. One of the best family board games for all tastes, Azul is easy to grasp but supports many tactical approaches and has surprising depth. The beautiful tiles and other components are high quality, and filling your board is deeply satisfying. Play moves quickly, and you can complete a game in less than an hour, but you will probably want to play again immediately. —Simon Hill Start with a randomly generated map of hexagonal tiles in this addictive family board game, and gather and trade resources to develop your civilization and win. Amassing enough victory points requires a smart strategy and some dice-rolling luck. Catan is easy to get the hang of and only takes around an hour to finish. Players can trade freely, but the robber mechanic can cause arguments, so set some ground rules. The modular randomization makes for excellent replay value, and there are expansions and spin-offs to further complicate the gameplay. This game is for three or four players aged 10 years and up. —Simon Hill This cat-themed card game is easy to pick up and perfect for a quick game. The aim is to avoid exploding kitten cards by wielding a comical cast of cats with special powers. Timing and strategy are essential to get the best of your opponents. This fun card game appears in our best family board games guide. If it’s a hit with your fam, there are countless expansion packs worth trying. —Simon Hill One of the best family board games for larger groups, Herd Mentality is all about writing down the same answer as everyone else. If you agree with the majority of players on the best pizza topping, Disney movie, or the smallest animal that could carry your weight, you win a cow token. Eight tokens win you the game, but if you are the odd one out, you get the pink cow of doom. It’s funny and easy to play with any group. —Simon Hill I’m going to be honest with you: I hate these blinky, twinkly, one-trick-pony toys because my kids play with them for a week or two and then put them away forever. (Give them sets or skills they can build on, like games, Lego, or instruments.) Nevertheless, I make an exception because Sphero’s toys are so delightful and this price is ridiculous. My colleague Simon Hill’s wife uses this coding ball as a classroom aid to teach basic coding skills to 9-year-olds and older. It’s adorable and can move and navigate mazes through infrared communication. —Adrienne So Loog Guitars is holding a sitewide sale for 40 percent off that ends tonight. This is cheating a bit, because my kids already know how to play piano and violin, but the Loog electric guitar is the fastest I've ever seen them pick up an instrument. The app is fun and engaging and my son even tuned it himself. (It's also an excuse to get on the iPad, grrr.) —Adrienne So This rock tumbler is perfect for any aspiring rock hound, and we say as much in our STEM toys buying guide. The kit includes four levels of grit, plus a bag of rough gemstones so they can get started tumbling during Christmas break. According to the Amazon reviews, this tumbler is also used and liked by some adults who've been putting rocks in their pockets for decades. —Adrienne So This stylish Lego set is from the botanicals collection, and can be loved by Lego fans and interior design fans alike. It’s a fun set to build with a person, too, since it’s built in two near-identical halves that you and someone else can make at the same time and then connect together. The finished piece has lived everywhere from my entryway to my dining room table to various shelves, and it’s looked good in every single spot. —Nena Farrell Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals If you use Samsung devices, this is a great triple wireless charger for your Galaxy phone, Galaxy smartwatch, and Galaxy earbuds. Since it’s Qi-compatible, you can also use it to charge other devices as well—including iPhones. It also has LEDs that light up quickly when you place your gadgets down on it, and it also comes with a 25-watt wall charger and USB-C cable. However, it doesn’t work with all Galaxy watches. We found that it was, however, compatible with the Watch4 and older Watch3. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite MagSafe dash mount for the iPhone 12 or later. You can attach it via dashboard pad or windshield with a suction cup—both of which proved secure in our testing. There’s also a telescopic arm that combines with a ball joint for a wide range of movement, allowing you to find the ideal position. The USB-C charging cable is removable too, so you can store it when it’s not in use. There’s also a built-in fan to help keep you cool when it gets hot outside. Our only gripe is that it tops out at 7.5 watts for charging. —Brenda Stolyar Durable and versatile, this power bank slips easily into a bag and has a nice grippy, textured finish. The yellow is easy to spot in a crowded tent, and the segmented LED shows the remaining power in blocks of 10 percent. The Charge 100 Max can charge up to five gadgets at once, and the wireless charging pad on top is handy in the dark when you don’t want to fumble with cables. This is the outdoors pick in our Best Portable Chargers guide. —Simon Hill We particularly love Belkin’s BoostCharge Pro for its compact design and support for 15-watt wireless charging. The prongs also cling to your vent securely and the array of magnets allow for a strong hold with MagSafe-enabled iPhones. With a ball joint, you can also angle your phone slightly for a better view of the screen. Unfortunately, the USB-C cable is permanently attached. —Brenda Stolyar This is our top 3-in-1 wireless charger if you want to utilize Apple’s StandBy Mode. Introduced with iOS 17, it turns your iPhone into a smart display. With Twelve South’s charger, you can place it in landscape mode to trigger the feature while also simultaneously charging two other devices on the base such as your Apple Watch or AirPods. —Brenda Stolyar Belkin’s Stand Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with DockKit integration, which means it can use the iPhone’s camera to track your face while the 360-degree base automatically moves around to keep you in frame. It’s great for those who FaceTime a lot and find themselves searching for objects to prop the phone on. It’s also an excellent accessory for content creators who want to record hands-free video on the go. With a built-in battery, you don’t need to worry about being near a power source either. But with support for MagSafe, you can also use it as a charger. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The best air fryers help you cook quickly and potentially with less fat or oil. These compact convection ovens heat up fast to make crispy chicken, fries, and donuts. This Cosori model is our favorite smart air fryer because you can remotely control it using a smartphone or tablet (it also has a digital control panel). We like the slick, black, classy design. The cooking drawer has a smooth action, and the handle stays cool, though the sides can get hot, so it needs plenty of space. Temperature options range from 175 degrees Fahrenheit to a powerful 400, with 12 handy preset cooking modes. —Simon Hill The Typhur dome air fryer cooks with blazing speed and has a modern round shape that I enjoyed in my testing. It’s easy to clean and has intuitive controls. —Martin Cizmar I love Cync's smart light bulbs, but the lights I use most by Cync are now the Undercabinet Pick Lights. They're easy to install under your cabinets, and easy to control over the app or a smart speaker. These undercabinet lights can do a variety of shades of whites, colors, and even fun effects that Cync calls Light Shows (my favorite is the candle option for moody fall lighting). They're usually $85, so getting three pucks to put under your kitchen cabinets is a nice discount. I used four pucks for four cabinets, two on either side of my cabinets around my oven, so I recommend at least two packs if you have cabinets split up by an oven. —Nena Farrell The Nutribullet Ultra is one of the best blenders we’ve tested. It’s stylish and has simple controls, and the 1,200-watt motor is powerful enough to handle all your smoothies, dips, and sauces. The 30-second blend is usually enough to get through your ingredients, but you might have to run a second cycle if you want the smoothest consistencies. The five-year warranty and suction cup feet are icing on the cake. Er, smoothie. We’ve seen this blender drop to $90 before, but anything below $110 is a good deal. —Louryn Strampe If you don't want to spring for the Thermapen above, the ThermoPop is a great budget option. It's not as fast, but it's still fast and the large, back-lit, auto-rotating screen is easy to read. It's waterproof, and accurate to plus or minus one degree. —Scott Gilbertson Instant-read thermometers are a kitchen essential. Can you prod your steak with a finger and accurately temp it? I think not. The Thermapen One will tell you the exact internal temperature in one second; no need for elaborate guesswork. Cheap instant-read thermometers litter Amazon, but we like the more expensive Thermapen One for its reliability and speed. The speed is important because the longer that oven door is open, the more unevenly you end up cooking. At this price, why not get the best? —Scott Gilbertson For those who want an air fryer but don’t want to devote the hefty counter space to a full-sized device, the WIRED Gear team’s favorite compact model is this nifty little Ninja, which is clocking in at a hefty discount. The cooker is still quite versatile for a wee thing, with settings that include max crisp, air fry, air roast, air broil, bake, reheat, and dehydrate. Our tester even managed to successfully bake a little chocolate cake. —Matthew Korfhage If you’ve been meaning to cut down on single-use plastics, now’s your chance. We love Stasher’s silicone bags, which are reusable and versatile, whether you’re meal prepping, storing leftovers, or cooking sous vide (7/10, WIRED Recommends). They’re dishwasher and microwave-safe, leakproof, and designed to last through thousands of uses. At $9, it’s a small price to pay for a sustainable swap you’ll use daily. —Boutayna Chokrane This excellent blender is durable and powerful. It’s got a generous 8-cup capacity and 10 blend settings. It gets pretty loud on the fastest setting, but our tester’s hummus was smooth in 30 seconds. The Braun has a touchscreen with several preset modes for things like smoothies, soups, spreads, frozen desserts, and more. The jar is made of Tritan, a type of impact-resistant plastic, rather than glass, but if that doesn’t bother you, this is a good deal on a reliable model. —Louryn Strampe We’ve tested a lot of food processors, and this model from KitchenAid is the very best we’ve tried. It comes in four colors and has a solid 9-cup capacity which has enough room to make servings for a family of four. The blades and discs can be stored in the bowl and the base has storage for the cord. You’ll get a multipurpose blade, a dough blade, a slicing disc, a julienne disc, and a whisk accessory. This deal matches the best price we’ve tracked. —Louryn Strampe The Enso is the WIRED Gear team’s favorite overall soda maker: durable, simple, sturdy, easy to use, and so intuitive you can make soda with one hand while skimming the news with your phone. If you use the HOLIDAY40 code on SodaStream’s website, it’s 40 percent off. —Matthew Korfhage This egg cooker fluctuates in price all the time, but this is one of the lowest prices we’ve seen it. It’s featured in our “Buy It for Life” guide. WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu says his wife loves this little countertop appliance, which can cook eggs in a myriad of different ways. Poach, soft-boil, hard-boil, or even whip up an omelet. It’ll chime to let you know when breakfast is served. It’s available in several cute colors like aqua, powder blue, and red. —Louryn Strampe How is a coffee warmer smart? Hint: It’s not because it uploads your habits to a cloud server. It’s smart because it turns itself on when you put a flat-bottomed coffee mug on top of it, and keeps your coffee warm at about 130 degrees. And it turns itself off when you remove the mug. So your coffee stays warm, and you don’t have to think about it. It makes for a great gift to anyone who likes, you know, warm beverages. —Matthew Korfhage Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals There has never been a better time to buy a robot vacuum. Even as the technology advances by leaps and bounds, many older models remain perfectly capable—and sometimes more than grand cheaper. The Q5 Pro+ has now been supplanted by Roborock’s Qrevo line, but this was our top pick for over a year and Roborock vacuums age well. I have a 6-year-old Roborock on the upper story of my house that is still going strong. —Adrienne So Dyson's V12 Detect Slim (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite Dyson vacuum if you have a small space, like a studio apartment or one-bedroom. It’s compact and lightweight, weighing only five pounds and just four feet long, and it’s perfect for both stashing in a small space and for vacuuming just a room or two since it has a run time of up to 60 minutes. It also comes with a variety of attachments. All and all, it’s pretty powerful for such a compact size. —Nena Farrell The Gen5Detect is one of the latest vacuums in Dyson’s lineup. The company swapped the trigger for a single power button and the Laser Slim Fluffy cleaner head now shoots out a laser that’s twice as bright. It packs the fastest motor yet, too, spinning at 135,000 revolutions per minute (RPM) with a suction power of 265 air watts (AW). Dyson added a HEPA filter as well, which Dyson says traps 99.99 percent of particles down to 0.1 microns. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite budget vacuum in our guide to Best Dyson Vacuums. A couple of years ago, the company updated the Motorbar Cleaner with its hair-detangling technology and hair screw tool. It has improved filtration too, with the ability to trap 99.99 percent of fine dust. This vacuum also converts into a hand vac, so you don’t have to buy a separate one. The battery should also last up to 40 minutes and takes about 5.5 hours to fully charge. If you're purchasing the vacuum from Kohl's, it's worth noting the sale ends at midnight. —Brenda Stolyar This is our top pick in our guide to Best Dyson Vacuums. It’s lightweight (at under 7 pounds), so it’s super easy to maneuver. My favorite feature is the green laser that shoots out of the front of the motorized head to help illuminate microscopic dust particles. There’s also a sensor built into the vacuum that counts the number and size of dust particles it’s sucking up. You can see the data on the LCD in real time. As for battery life, you’ll get a 60-minute run time while the battery itself takes up to 4.5 hours to charge. It’s pricey, but the features and performance are worth it. —Brenda Stolyar If you’re not interested in one of Dyson’s standard vacuums, you can opt for a robot vacuum instead. With a spin speed of 110,000 RPM, this one is super powerful. It also has a digital display and a filter that’s easy to remove and clean. According to Dyson, it also has six times more suction than the competition. It also comes equipped with a “triple-action” brush bar, which includes soft nylon for large debris on hard floors, antistatic carbon-fiber filaments for fine dust, and stiff nylon bristles for carpet. —Brenda Stolyar Top of our best carpet cleaners guide, this vacuum did an excellent job removing cat hair and lingering odors. It’s easy to use, comes with two removable tanks, and has a special spray jet to target stains. Fill the top tank to the marked lines with warm water and detergent, pull a trigger on the handle to wet wash, and then run over the area slowly and watch the bottom tank fill with dirty water. You can choose from three modes (Max, Deep, and Express), and it comes with multiple attachments, including one for upholstery and another for stairs. —Simon Hill Shark’s AI Ultra 2-in-1 mopping vacuum earned a “Most Improved Award” from me in 2022; the company recently replaced it with the Matrix. Shark’s products can be hit or miss, but happily I liked the Matrix very much. It has multifunctional vacuuming and mopping and is pretty reliable. It doesn’t need replacement dust bags—which is both a blessing and a curse, as the self-emptying dustbin sometimes doesn’t empty quite all the way. —Adrienne So The PetSafe ScoopFree SmartSpin Self-Cleaning Litter Box is around half the price of other popular (and expensive) automatic litter box models, and has a similar design. This futuristic-looking pod on legs has a weight detector that sets off the cleaning cycle a few minutes after your cat has gone to the bathroom, and has a slide-out tray in the bottom. It’s also connected to an app so that you review your cat’s toilet visits, where each entry displays the time they went, their weight, and trip duration. This box works surprisingly well and is a cheap alternative if you really hate taking out the litter but don’t want to shell out the big bucks. —Molly Higgins Like all of the Petlibro products I tested for my Automatic Pet Feeder guide, the One RFID Smart Feeder is a super-techy and sleek cat product. For this feeder, the pet wears a collar with a tag in which the feeder’s lid opens and retracts over the kibble when the cat approaches or leaves, ensuring that only the chosen pet with the collar can access the food. In my review, I called this “a nearly perfect device for a particular kind of pet owner.” I think this feeder would work best for a cat in a dog home, if one particular cat has special dietary needs, or if you have a multi-cat home with an aggressive eater. At only a little over 100 bucks, this would be a good time to snag and see if this product would work well for your pet. —Molly Higgins Petlibro’s Polar Wet Food Feeder is a smart little invention and first of its kind in the Automatic Pet Feeder realm—it’s basically a minifridge that operates via the app to deliver wet food that can be safely stored for up to 3 days. You can customize feeding schedules via the app and the Polar even shuts off cooling 30 minutes before feeding to make sure the food is not too cold if your cat is as picky as mine. I already have one at home, but at a great value for less than a hundred bucks right now ($80), I’m ordering a second one for my other cat. Gone are the days of them screeching for a can of wet food at 5 am. —Molly Higgins The best smart Christmas lights you can buy are on sale. Perfect timing if you need to upgrade. Easy to set up, with a black or green cord that blends nicely into the tree, Twinly’s lights support all kinds of colors and animated effects via the app, and you can also make custom effects. You can design based on an existing pattern, draw with your fingers, or even upload a GIF. Draped on a tree, the lights are best with gradient and stripe-style patterns, like the candy cane stripe effect. —Simon Hill One of the cheapest and best Govee smart lights you can buy is this affordable light strip that comes in several lengths. It is designed to be hidden behind furniture, so you just see the reflected light. We are highlighting the longest 100-foot option here, but all are segmented to display multiple colors, can be controlled wirelessly from the app or using voice controls, and support Govee’s enormous variety of lighting effects. These light strips also appear in our best smart lighting guide. —Simon Hill Nanoleaf makes fantastic wall light panels that double as light and home decor. The brand is famous for the hexagon sets, but Nanoleaf has expanded into other shapes, including triangles and light strips and even ceiling panels, in the past several years. This seven-pack of Nanoleaf Shapes Triangles is a fun size to use around the TV, in your office, or on any wall that could use a little fun added to it. It's a solid sale price, too, making it a good time to buy. —Nena Farrell If you’re looking for a great sunrise alarm clock for the price, you can’t do better than the Philips SmartSleep Wake-Up Light, especially now that it’s on sale. It’s a great little lamp that gets plenty bright to help you rise, and is easy to use and set up, too. It doesn’t have any nighttime routine options, but if you aren’t worried about those, this is a great purchase. —Nena Farrell If you're interested in light panels for your walls but want ones that will look just as nice when they're off as when they're turned on, Nanoleaf's Elements are a great choice. They’re our pick in the Best Nanoleaf Smart Lights for infrequent use since they have a wood finish, so you'll gain a more natural style statement when they’re turned off. These lights only glow in shades of white, so you’ll lose out on the rainbow aspect. Still, it's a nice trade-off, and you can get these on sale for almost $100 off right now. —Nena Farrell I'm not surprised this frame is on sale—Skylight just launched a new version earlier this fall, and it's fantastic, allowing you to switch out the frame style at will. This original model is still a solid digital photo frame, and it’s the best sale price you’ll find right now on digital photo frames. —Nena Farrell OK, we know you know about Ember’s temperature-controlled mugs, but Ohom’s is a whole different—and much simpler—beast. It’s not overengineered; you don’t have to connect it to your phone, check an app, and get constant phone pings. Instead, it looks and feels exactly like your favorite ceramic mug and the set keeps your coffee at the temperature you want to drink. That’s it! The heating pad also works as a charging pad! Just don’t put the mug in the microwave (which you shouldn’t anyway, because that makes coffee taste gross) and you’re good to go. —Adrienne So I’ve had this boxy model in my kitchen for over two years now to mitigate some of the combustion particulates from my gas stove, and this is one of the best sales for it I’ve seen. I especially appreciate that its HEPA replacement filters are both easy to find and inexpensive (Amazon has them for $26 for two). WIRED contributor Lisa Wood Shapiro also notes in our guide to the Best Air Purifiers that it has an excellent air exchange rate for small rooms, cleaning the air in 361 square feet at the recommended rate of 4.8 times per hour. —Kat Merck The Airmega 250 from clean air leader Coway provides the industrial vibe your home or loft needs. The warm gray box looks like a high-end speaker. And the Airmega 250 can do four air exchanges an hour when fitted for a 465-square-foot room. Utilizing a HEPA filter, this CARB-certified air purifier also has a washable prefilter along with an activated carbon filter to capture odors and VOCs. It has a built-in air quality sensor with indicator light and an easy-to-use control panel. It’s not app-compatible but does have a three-year warranty and runs at a relatively quiet 22 decibels. —Lisa Wood Shapir It takes a special screwdriver to deal with the soft, tiny, often infuriating screws that manufacturers love to use on anything from laptops to eyeglasses to remote controls–and these tiny screws often gatekeep simple repairs. Our Gear team’s testers haven’t been too impressed with multi-tools for screwdrivers this small. Get a good, tiny set like this Wiha 7-in-1 instead. —Matthew Korfhage The “super plush” name is true to the core. This super-soft robe is what I grab after every shower—my towel just has hair duty these days. It's a cozy robe that can dry you off while you're doing your hair, and it dries nicely for my next shower. If I were shopping for a new one, I'd jump for one of the cute striped options. Brooklinen often runs sales, but 25 percent off this robe is better than you'll usually find. —Nena Farrell This Arlo model has everything you need in an indoor security camera, including crisp 2K video at 24 frames per second, two-way audio, and a compact design that includes a privacy shutter. You can expect a quick loading feed in the Arlo app, useful smart notifications, and two-factor authentication, so you can log in with your fingerprint or face if your phone allows. Sadly, you need a pricey subscription (Arlo Secure costs $8 per month for one camera or $13 per month for unlimited cameras) for subject recognition, smart alerts, and cloud storage. This is the upgrade pick in our best indoor security cameras guide. —Simon Hill While it’s not our top pick, Google’s Nest Cam does make our list of the best outdoor security cameras and is a solid choice if you have a Nest Doorbell or other Google gadgets. The HD resolution is limited, but that’s offset by the HDR and high frame rate, and the face recognition is the best we have tested in a security camera. The Nest Aware subscription at $8 a month ($80/year) is too much if you only have a single camera, but that price covers multiple devices. —Simon Hill I love my Reolink doorbell, which does everything I need it to without the hassles of a glitchy app that needs to be updated every two weeks or any monthly fee. Don’t take my word for it, though: When my curling club needed a security system, another club member, who installs security cameras professionally, suggested we skip pricier options and just do a Reolink system. We’ve got an Reolink Altas PT Ultra (on sale for $160, which is $70 off) running inside over the bar and a solar-powered REOLINK Argus 4 Pro (on sale for $140 which is $80 off) running in the parking lot, which has drawn rave reviews based on the low cost (curling is a Scottish sport and thriftiness is part of the culture) and the fact that the whole leadership structure can access the footage from their phones via the Home Hub ($99). —Martin Cizmar These affordable Govee Wi-Fi Water Sensors are quick and easy to install, and send alerts as push notifications and emails to warn you when there’s a leak. With a very loud siren (100 decibels) you will hear them if you are home, and you can shut off the sound from the app. The sensors are compact with drip detection on top and metal feet for leak detection beneath. Alerts triggered within a few seconds in my tests, earning them a place in our best water leak detectors guide. The app is basic but works well and gives you an alert history. They do require a Govee Wi-Fi hub (included), which needs a power outlet, and it’s big enough that it may block an adjacent outlet. Each sensor also needs two AA batteries (provided). —Simon Hill Mattresses are frequently advertised with inflated discounts, and this mattress from Nectar was only $100 more than this earlier in November. However, it’s still a big discount on an all-foam mattress that’s solidly on the soft side despite being advertised as “medium firm.” —Martin Cizmar The original millennial bed-in-a-box has been sold a few times in recent years and recently went through a full-line redesign. I was impressed with the new Casper baseline mattress during my week of testing, as it retains a classic memory foam feel but is more firm and supportive than many competitors. We originally linked the queen version but it's not available, other sizes are. —Martin Cizmar Brooklinen's Cyber Monday sale ends on Tuesday night, with 25 percent off the entire site and up to 50 percent off bundles. There are a ton of great sheets worth shopping there, from the linen to the sateen, but Brooklinen's percale is my favorite of their sheet options. It's a nice crisp sheet and has an organic option (on sale for $172) that's a touch softer than the regular version. Both the organic and the classic percale sets are on sale right now for 25 percent off. —Nena Farrell Cozy Earth's Bamboo Sheet Set has been on the top of our Best Sheets guide ever since we started testing sheets, and it’s a star of our new Best Bamboo Sheets guide, too. These sheets, made with bamboo viscose, feel insanely soft and downright chilly to the touch before warming up like melted butter around you as you sleep. It's a downright decadent sheet set that's usually a splurge, which is why Cozy Earth's sale is the perfect time to shop. —Nena Farrell I've tried a lot of wearable breast pumps. They're supremely handy to use, but the Medela Freestyle (7/10, WIRED Recommends) will always be a favorite of mine because it was the most lightweight and had the least amount of parts to clean. And if you pump often, or even just once a day, having less cleaning to do feels like a lifesaver. The motor is in the handheld controller that you can pop in your pocket rather than weighing down your bra. It's comfortable, handy, and on sale for a great price compared to what you'll usually find it for. —Nena Farrell This handy little drill is a home tool kit essential. It’s got enough power to handle tasks that need extra torque, and the half-inch chuck will accept basically every drill bit size. This kit includes two batteries and a charger, and the batteries are also compatible with other DeWalt tools. This deal comes within $10 of the best we’ve seen. If you need bits, we recommend this kit, which is also on sale. —Louryn Strampe This inexpensive kit is full of our favorite drill bits. The black oxide coating both reduces friction and resists rust, and the drill bits can handle wood, metal, plastics, wallboard, and fiberglass. These go on sale frequently, but this is still a good get, especially if you’re picking up the discounted DeWalt drill that we also recommend. —Louryn Strampe Luxome's bamboo sheets are the best bamboo sheets you can buy, with fantastic quality made from bamboo viscose (which is better than bamboo rayon!), tons of gorgeous colors from which to choose, a fantastically silky-soft feel, and a good price point. Luxome is hosting its only sale of the year right now, so you can get these amazing sheets for even cheaper than usual. The white color has an extra $5 discount if you don’t mind missing out on the gorgeous ocean and terracotta colors. —Nena Farrell Casper's Hybrid Snow Pillow is our favorite pillow, period. It might not seem like it at first touch, but this pillow is super supportive for your head with its foam core and soft memory fiber surrounding it. Former WIRED reviewer Eric Ravenscraft found it to be his go-to pillow after testing tons of pillows for our guide. He says it's cooling, too, which is a nice bonus. He recommends catching it on sale, making now the ideal time to shop to get a little discount. —Nena Farrell This highly rated and reviewed body pillow on Amazon is my personal cheap pick for the Best Body Pillows for its relatively large size and comfiness. The plush fiber filling is soft enough that it can be contorted into many shapes and isn’t overstuffed, making it super easy to wrap your arms and legs around. The pillow refills back to shape without the filling getting bunched in one area or just going flat after a few weeks like some cheaper body pillows. I liked this super-soft pillow, and it’s a really great deal at a fraction of the price of other body pillows with comparable comfort. —Molly Higgins This large wall map is gorgeous. The world is shiny gold until countries and states are scratched off with a coin. It’s a great way to track your adventures, whether close to home or international. The colored areas of the map have nice details like major cities and topography, and while they’re appealing to look at, they’re also neutral enough that they’ll fit in with any decor.

It’s not perfect, but it’s quite adjustable, works for people of varying heights, and the high-density foam seat is cushy. You can lock the recline and adjust the lumbar support, and it helps that it’s also a very stylish office chair compared to its plain black competitors. For more discounts at Branch, read our separate story here. —Julian Chokkattu If your office chair budget is a little higher, then consider the Branch Verve. The main thing to note is that the arms are fixed—they can go up and down but not side to side. That’s my only real gripe with this chair; everything else is a nice upgrade over the Branch Ergonomic Chair, from build quality to back support. It also looks even more elegant, and there’s a headrest add-on if you want to shut your eyes and nap for a bit in between Zoom meetings. —Julian Chokkattu This chair is best suited for people under 5’9,” as it gave me back pain after several days in it (I’m 6’4”). After I asked a friend around 5’4” to try it, they liked it a lot and had no major qualms. It has a mesh back and a thick foam seat. Too bad it looks very, very dull. But maybe you want something nondescript! —Julian Chokkattu When it comes to writing, there’s nothing quite like the smooth 0.7 mm glide of the Paper Mate InkJoy Gel Pens. With 14 bold colors to choose from, this set is a rainbow of possibilities; whether you’re color-coding, writing in a planner, or doodling, their versatility and flair have earned them a permanent spot in our writing toolkit. —Boutayna Chokrane We love paper planners around here, and our favorite weekly planner is the Happy Planner. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano found herself purchasing it year after year, and I can see why. It's got plenty of space for writing down plans and to-do lists, lots of fun covers, and a great price point. Score a planner for the new year (or a gift for your favorite planner person!) with Happy Planner's 30 percent off sale. —Nena Farrell It’s never too late to get organized and Class Tracker makes the best paper planners for students. There are monthly calendars, but the weekly pages shine. Each day sports a section for things to remember, tests, papers, or projects due, and larger spots for assignments and a daily plan. A Self-Care Corner gives you space for non-school things to focus on and a countdown box for something you're looking forward to. If you or the student in your life is struggling to get organized, this planner could help. —Simon Hill The Ryzen 9 7950X is one of AMD’s most powerful CPUs, and is on a steep discount. Anyone building a new PC or looking to upgrade theirs for raw computing power will want to check out this 16-core, 32-thread monster. The already ultra-fast 4.5GHz base clock can be pushed even higher with overclocking, making this an excellent choice for demanding workloads like video editing or 3D rendering. It’s also the perfect counterpart to a high-end GPU for the best possible experience in any video game. —Brad Bourque Logitech has a long history of great keyboards, and the MX Mechanical Mini is no exception. This wireless keyboard packs backlit keys, wired or wireless connectivity, and low-profile mechanical switches in your choice of tactile quiet, clicky, or linear. If you’ve got tons of devices, you should know the MX Mini also has wide support for operating systems and devices, including iOS. That makes this one of our favorite upgraded keyboards for tablet power users who want to unfold for a bit into a proper workstation. —Brad Bourque We recommended this Wi-Fi 6E system in our best mesh routers guide until it was replaced by the newer XE70 Pro, but this is still a good choice, especially with the discount. It is a tri-band (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz) mesh with impressive range and stability. Each of the three routers has three Gigabit ports. By default, the 6-GHz band is reserved for wireless backhaul, but you can open it up for devices. If you have a connection of 1 Gbps or less, this mesh will serve you well. While enhanced security and parental controls require subscriptions, most folks can live without them. —Simon Hill Few USB webcams can match the Logitech C920 Pro’s quality, and at $50—half its usual price—it’s a bargain. With crisp 1080p and autofocus, it works great for video calls and streaming. Its white color balance is similar to the Razer webcam, and while the 78-degree field of view can be a bit tight, it just requires manual adjustments. It’s also missing a privacy shutter, but for a high-performing webcam, this is an unbeatable price. —Boutayna Chokrane The best Wi-Fi 6E router in our best routers guide, this hexagonal Asus router impressed in my tests. It’s a tri-band router, adding the 6-GHz band to the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz. The new band is very fast, though it is relatively low range and doesn’t penetrate through walls very well. There’s ample connectivity with a 2.5-Gbps WAN/LAN port, a second 1-Gbps WAN/LAN, and a further three gigabit LANs. Asus also offers free security and parental controls and all the settings you need in the mobile app and browser interface, including band-splitting, prioritization for different activities, guest network, VPN support, and so on. —Simon Hill This affordable security camera is our pick of the best indoor security cameras because it offers clear 2K footage, with a starlight sensor that enables color night vision. Smart detection (people, pets, and vehicles) is handy, and the slightly laggy two-way audio is fine. Pop in a microSD card (up to 512 GB) for local recording, or opt for a Tapo Care subscription for 30 days of cloud storage that starts at $3.50 per month. It also has an IP66 rating so it can be used outdoors. —Simon Hill This cute little indoor security camera is a cheaper version of our favorite model. It loses some features, like pet and vehicle detection, but TP-Link has reliable motion detection and customizable notifications. It's often on sale for around $20, but you can get it for extra cheap right now. —Nena Farrell Gamers don’t need a special gaming router, but if you love customizable RGB lighting, this mesh will tempt you. It’s not just fancy lighting that makes it worth a look, because this tri-band Asus ROG Rapture GT6 finished high up the table in most tests. With a single 2.4-GHz band and two 5-GHz bands (one is used for backhaul unless you connect the routers with an Ethernet cable), it can keep all your gaming gear online. The 5-GHz band supports wider 160-MHz channels and WPA3 for security. You also get AiProtection security software and comprehensive parental controls included without a subscription. The game modes boost performance and prioritize gaming traffic, and each router has a 2.5 Gbps WAN port, three 1 gigabit LAN ports, and a USB 3.2 Gen 1 port. —Simon Hill If you’re working in a hot environment, I highly suggest you get an all-mesh seat. These kinds of office chairs maximize airflow, allowing body heat to dissipate instead of trapping it. The Ergo3D has all the main points of adjustment you’d want and it’s a roomy chair. You even get two kinds of wheels in the box (casters or rollerblades) and you can insert whichever works best for your flooring. It’s not my favorite all-mesh chair, but it’s one of the few decent ones you’ll find south of $500. —Julian Chokkattu The SM57 is the most-used instrument mic in the history of recorded audio, by a large factor. It sounds great on guitar amps and beyond, and can be used to record essentially anything you need in a pinch. I’d stick to the extremely similar SM58 if you need a vocal mic, but if you need to record anything else, an SM57 is a must-have. —Parker Hall If you asked a child to draw a picture of a microphone, you’d get an image of the Shure SM58. This standard of stage and studio is so rugged you can use it as a hammer and it will still sound great after, though I don’t recommend you dent that iconic grille too soon. The dynamic microphone works great with any audio interface, and has a sound that you’ll be very familiar with if you’ve ever seen anyone sing live. —Parker Hall Shure’s SM7B microphone has been a studio staple for decades. While it’s gotten subtle improvements over the years, including an upgraded voice coil and a larger windscreen, it’s changed very little in its long tenure–you don’t mess with perfection. You’ll see this mic in multiple movies and TV shows (once you know it you can’t unsee it), as well as in real studios worldwide. It’s a killer option for podcasting and talk radio and works great as a vocal mic too. It’s designed to bring the best of your vocals to light, with little coloration so you just get the gritty goodness your unique voice provides. This is among the few standards I recommend first for any singer or creator, along with other favorites like the Electrovoice RE20, the do-it-all AKG C414, and the classic Shure SM58. —Ryan Waniata Every system needs a hard drive, and WD has been providing them for as long as I can remember. It’s nothing groundbreaking, but taking some dollars off this 1-TB internal drive might make it a more appealing second drive, or the main SSD in a budget-friendly system. With read speeds up to 560 MBps, you might not want to spend a ton of time transferring files on and off this drive, but it’s more than adequate enough for gaming and daily use, and priced well to boot. —Brad Bourque Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Asus Chromebook Plus CX34 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best-looking Chromebook you can buy. The beautiful white design stands out in a sea of gray slabs. The Core i5 CPU offers plenty of performance to easily handle multiple tabs and app juggling. The webcam is nice too, much crisper than you’d expect for a $500 laptop. The downside is there's no backlit keyboard. —Scott Gilbertson The 13-inch Surface Laptop (7th Edition) (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite processor. Performance was good in our testing. It did not bog down no matter how many windows, tabs, and apps we threw at it. That said, this is not a machine for graphics-intensive tasks, like video editing or gaming (which is a shame because the vivid sharp screen with a 120-Hz screen refresh rate would be great for gaming). —Scott Gilbertson Dell's two larger XPS laptops (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are aimed at Windows users with MacBook jealousy. The design, specs, and sizes align perfectly with Apple's offerings. The XPS 14 has a gorgeous, sleek design (though it's thicker than a MacBook), a wonderfully bright and sharp OLED screen (with 120-Hz screen refresh rates), and is plenty speedy for everyday tasks. Unfortunately, heavy-duty tasks like video editing … well, the MacBook's benchmarks run circles around the XPS 14. Still, with this deal, this is a serious piece of hardware for not a lot of money. —Scott Gilbertson There's much to love about Samsung's Galaxy Book4 (7/10, WIRED Review), but let's be honest, that sticker price is insane. This deal brings it down somewhat, though it's still pricey. You do get impressive hardware—the new Intel Core Ultra 9 185H processor and current top-of-the-line processor in Intel’s Core Ultra CPU lineup, along with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card. The 16-inch AMOLED 2,880 x 1,800 pixels touchscreen is magnificent to work on and performance blew everything else we've tested out of the water. —Scott Gilbertson Who says you always have to buy the latest and greatest? If you get a tablet from Samsung’s 2023 Tab S9 series, you can save some serious cash and get an equally great experience (7/10, WIRED Recommends). The Tab S9 is the smallest, and next comes the Tab S9+, both of which have AMOLED screens and are IP68-rated for water resistance. The Tab S9 Ultra is down to $800 ($400 off), and it’s massive and designed to be a travel-friendly computer when you don’t want to lug a laptop around. Also, check out the Galaxy Tab S9 FE and Galaxy Tab FE+. If you just want a tablet to watch some shows, read, and play some games, these affordable slates are better than their predecessors, with smoother performance, and you still get a stylus in the box. They’re nearly identical—the FE+ just has more RAM and a bigger screen. —Julian Chokkattu The Galaxy Tab S10 series is the iPad Pro-equivalent of the Android world. The Tab S10+ has a reasonable 12.4-inch screen size, but the Tab S10 Ultra sports a massive 14.6-inch screen that is unwieldy to hold—you’ll want to pair it with a kickstand case. The Ultra is on sale for $1,000 ($200 off), but the Tab S10+ is much better value overall. You get the S Pen included for doodling and note-taking, the AMOLED screen is stunning, and it will receive 7 years of software updates. My primary issue is the price, and it’s still expensive at $850, but if you want the best tablet Android has to offer, this is it. —Julian Chokkattu You might think that giving your grandparents an older tablet might be fine, but things can get complicated fast if they’re not familiar with the software. Enter the GrandPad (8/10, WIRED Recommends). The company has been around for a decade and offers a custom tablet experience designed for seniors. That means larger touch targets, an easy-to-follow user interface, and LTE connectivity out of the box. There’s also 24/7 customer care and emergency 911 calling in case something happens. They won’t ever need to plug it in—just have them place it on the wireless charging dock and it’ll always be at the ready. The downside is this all involves a pricey subscription plan. If you buy directly from GrandPad, you get $100 off the annual subscription, but if you buy directly from Amazon, you get $100 off the tablet itself. You can’t use the tablet without a subscription. —Julian Chokkattu Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Bose’s Smart Soundbar (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite mini bar, even if it’s on the pricier side for a small bar that doesn’t come with a dedicated subwoofer. That means you’re sacrificing some punch down low, but in its place you’re getting fantastic immersion thanks to true upfiring drivers (something the Sonos Beam doesn’t have), Wi-Fi streaming and networking, and some innovative audio features. Those include a new AI dialog mode that brings forth voices and center-channel information with remarkable clarity. You can also now use the brand’s Open Earbuds as clip-on personal surround speakers. The Bose app is simple and intuitive, and lets you easily add other speakers like a Bose Bass module down the line. —Ryan Waniata Every TV deserves better sound, and this cheap soundbar and wireless subwoofer from Yamaha is a great way to get it. It’s super easy to set up with a simple HDMI eARC connection, and it brings a shocking amount of depth to content you probably watched through tinny TV speakers. Its little brother, the SR-C20A, has been our best soundbar for most of the year, and this brings more bass at a now-discounted price. —Parker Hall Sonos’ indomitable Arc (9/10, WIRED Recommends) has new competition from within courtesy of the Arc Ultra, which offers subtle but impactful sonic improvements and the ability to connect over 5GHz Wi-Fi. At $1,000, though, it’s not the best fit for all budgets. The regular Arc is still a winner, providing full and warm sound, excellent detail for dialog and music, and impressive immersion for surround sound and Dolby Atmos soundtracks via side- and up-firing drivers. Like other Sonos gear, you can add surround speakers or the new Sub 4 subwoofer, or connect with other speakers for all the multi-room audio tricks upon which Sonos made its name. You’ll also get built-in microphones for smart home control. Though Sonos’ app has had its struggles lately, it seems to be on more solid ground. If you’ve been waiting on a potent standalone bar with room for larger aspirations, this Arc deal is worth grabbing. —Ryan Waniata Klipsch’s Flexus Core 200 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) sounds bigger and brawnier than you’d expect for the money, pushing toward bars that cost twice as much. Its MDF construction (in place of plastic) offers deep and musical resonance, and its upfiring drives expand the sound to accentuate Dolby Atmos films and TV shows to cinematic heights (literally). Dialog is also clear and present thanks to a dedicated center channel. The trade-off is that there’s no Wi-Fi support as you’d expect for this price, but the bar is not without its innovative extras. As the name implies, the system provides flexible expansion with available surround speakers and a thumpy subwoofer. This bar is one of the best soundbars around for those who put sound quality first at full price, and a true bargain on sale. —Ryan Waniata Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals It’s hard to think of a more stalwart consumer electronics product over the last decade than Sony’s WH-1000XM4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). Even four years after their debut, they serve as a benchmark for new contenders and premium offerings from top players alike. Their noise canceling isn’t top tier, but it’s still very good, and a raft of features—from a multi-band EQ to a touch control that turns on transparency mode temporarily for announcements or quick conversations—makes them feel advanced even as they gracefully age. Their sound is warm and bassy, yet refreshingly refined, and their durable plastic shells harbor plush padding for hours of comfort. You can outdo these noise cancelers with the latest Bose QuietComfort Ultra or Sony’s step-up WH-1000XM5, but there’s no question as to why Sony’s kept them around for multiple generations. —Ryan Waniata Technics isn’t the first name you think of for wireless earbuds, but the EAH-AZ80 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are among the best earbuds out there for their mix of a snug and comfy fit, great features, solid noise canceling, and sterling sound. The flashy gleam of their endcaps seems to tease their sound signature, which is slick, clear, and deeply textural to bring instruments to life. The AZ80’s noise canceling doesn’t catch Bose or even Sony’s top buds, but it’s good enough, and multipoint pairing with three different devices at once makes these buds uniquely versatile. This is a great pair at a good price, making them worth grabbing for those who put fit and sound quality first. Only the silver come in at the lowest price, but other colors are also steeply discounted. —Ryan Waniata Soundpeats has a knack for making affordable earbuds with exceptionally good sound. In fact, we recently gave their latest pair that uses a new kind of driver, the Soundcapsule 3+, a perfect 10/10. The Air4 Pro (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are not that pair, but they serve up clear and balanced sound along with solid noise canceling for a very low asking price. They don’t have the spoils you’ll get in flagships like the AirPods Pro (even if they look a lot like them), but for well below $100 they’re a worthy option that could make a great gift for the budding music lover in your life. —Ryan Waniata Need a cheap pair of earbuds to not think too much about? Look no further than the Go Air Pop, which are utterly usable earbuds that cost less than $20. I like keeping a pair in my car or gym bag for when I forget to bring nicer buds with me and still want music. —Parker Hall I didn’t set out to love the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds (7/10, WIRED recommends). Even on sale, they’re pricey for such a limited use case, but damn if they haven’t become my favorite open earbuds on the market. Their curlicue barrel design takes some getting used to, but they roll onto your ears with impressive tenacity, staying put without pinching tight. Once in place, the little sound beams from their snake-like acoustic housings offer the most well-rounded performance I’ve heard in the genre. Like other open-ear models, you won’t get noise canceling or isolation so the sound is always blended with the world around you, but it’s a fantastic trick for working out or staying aware in any number of situations. These aren’t the best earbuds for every scenario, but if you can spend up for a targeted pair of standby buds alongside your best noise-canceling buds, you may just fall for them too. —Ryan Waniata Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra headphones (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are premium in style and performance, as you’d expect from the best noise-canceling headphones on the market. Their plush and ergonomic design makes them a joy to wear, while their penchant for noise-strangling makes them the ultimate choice for serious travelers or those who simply need unparalleled tranquility in their home or office. I also really enjoy the sound, which is less forward than Bose flagships past, while still providing excellent instrumental separation and deft balance. The battery provides a solid 30 hours per charge and the headphones add futuristic features like 3D audio virtualization with head-tracking to feel more like a pair of speakers. At well over $400, these are a serious splurge, but at this price they feel more like a steal. —Ryan Waniata The Jabra Elite series have been our top pick in our guide to workout headphones for years. Unfortunately, the company recently decided to stop making them. Although the earbuds have an unusually long two-year warranty, some of my colleagues would counsel you not to pick them. However, these are still the most comfortable and secure workout headphones that I’ve tried. They have an unusual feature, which is that you can plug the case into a 3.5-mm headphone jack to listen to them on a plane. It’s neat! These are still great for travel! —Adrienne So Jabra’s Elite 4 Active (9/10, WIRED Recommends) were almost shockingly good upon release a couple of years back, and they’re still an excellent buy today–especially on sale. As part of Jabra’s sporty overhaul, they blend serious durability with a comfy fit, smooth and balanced sound, and plenty of ways to personalize the experience in the Jabra app. They even provide a slab of noise canceling, though it’s more of an aid to their noise-isolating fit. They’re also dust and water-resistant, meaning you can dunk them or rinse them after a sweaty workout with no ill effects. Jabra has called it quits on consumer earbuds, but the stalwart brand pledges to support its current products through its warranty, so there’s no reason to hesitate. —Ryan Waniata Sony’s WH-1000XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) take nearly everything we loved about the previous model a step further, offering a mix of fabulous features and excellent noise canceling, comfort, and sound quality. These headphones have everything, from multipoint pairing and auto-pause sensors to brilliant touch commands and Amazon Alexa support. They’re perfect for travel, but just as handy for wearing around the house. They’re not quite as packable as the previous model, the XM4, but that’s really the only flaw in an otherwise near-perfect package. —Ryan Waniata These bone-conduction headphones are the option you’re probably most likely to see in the wild. They use your jaw bones to route sound to your ears, which means you can hear everything around. This version is smaller than the newer second generation, which makes them better for folks with smaller heads (there is also a mini version on sale). —Parker Hall Jabra may be getting out of the earbud game, but the Elite 5 are still excellent earbuds that should last for many years of solid use. They’re comfortable and durable (IP55 rated), and the hybrid noise cancellation makes them great on flights or calls. Sound quality is excellent, with bold bass and enough midrange that you can hear every detail of the guitar or piano. —Parker Hall These are some of our favorite gifts for new parents, though anyone who experiences overstimulation might benefit from them. They’re designed for concerts to slightly reduce noise while still letting you hear. That makes them perfect for parents who need a little break from sleep training or the soundtrack of the Terrible Twos. You’ll still hear your kiddo, but you’ll be able to focus on their needs instead of that otherworldly screeching that can only be produced by a colicky newborn. —Louryn Strampe Denon’s PerL earbuds (7/10, WIRED Reviewed) don’t fit or feel quite like traditional earbuds, but their sound is seriously impressive thanks to the most advanced personalization system I’ve tested in the genre. These buds tune to your hearing profile, which for me equated to richer, fuller, and more intimate sound across my catalog. The profile they create may take some time to lock in, but once you do, it’s an impressive ride. I wasn’t convinced with the overall execution at $200, but at half the price, this is a killer deal for serious listeners. —Ryan Waniata The fully tweakable noise canceling inside these reflective workout earbuds makes them great for folks who like to be aware of their surroundings when outdoors but enjoy a bit of silence when inside. They have excellent sound quality and call quality and work as intended, allowing you to adjust how much of the outside world you want to hear at any given moment with easy-to-use touch controls. —Parker Hall Kids are extremely susceptible to hearing loss, which is why WIRED staffers who are parents love headphones like these that limit output to the OSHA-recommended 85 decibels. The noise canceling is excellent and will help with louder noises on flights or from HVAC, and these also come in either pink or blue, so you can get whichever color your kiddo prefers. —Parker Hall Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The WIRED Gear team battles over who gets to review each generation of this adorable Bluetooth speaker, because it’s just so handy. A tiny little rubber strap lets you attach it to everything from handlebars to backpacks. It sounds shockingly good for its size, too, and a rugged IP67 rating means you don’t need to worry if it takes a spill. —Parker Hall Ultimate Ears makes some of our favorite speakers, and the Boom series is a standout. An update of the relatively ancient Boom 3, the Boom 4 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) brings long-awaited USB-C charging and modestly redesigned drivers. Its performance offers the same clear, smooth, and balanced presentation we’ve come to expect from the series. You’ll also get up to 15 hours of battery life, the ability to stereo pair with another Boom 4, and plenty of ways to adjust the sound in the app. This isn’t the bassiest speaker for its size, but its sound is more refined than cheaper knock-offs. Its primary drawback is its high price, which makes now the right time to strike. —Ryan Waniata Marshall’s pivot to rock-inspired Bluetooth speakers has been very successful from a product standpoint. These robust speakers feature great design and even better sound, plus I like that they have a strap that makes them easy to carry with other items when you’re packing in to a campsite. Twenty hours of playtime and 20 watts of output means you’ll be jamming loud and for a while, and an IPX4 rating means this is fine in the rain. —Parker Hall The best Bluetooth speakers offer a mix of durability, sound quality, and aesthetics, which is exactly how I’d describe this mid-tier model from Ultimate Ears. The folks who design these spend a lot of time testing their limits, from drop tests to bleach testing them in the desert sun, and that makes them great for folks who tend to be harder on consumer electronics. If you have a fisherman, hunter, or contractor in your life, UE is the brand for you. —Parker Hall Round Bluetooth speakers like this one might seem hard to place, but the built-in leather strap that comes with the Beosound A1 makes it very easy to hang anywhere you might need to. It’s a very well-made speaker, with a sleek metal exterior that can survive a heck of a lot of abuse. The normal downside is the price, which is negated by this deal. —Parker Hall JBL’s Authentics 200 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) speaks fluent Google and Alexa, letting you pick your smart home poison. That means it can act as a controller for multiple types of smart home products without the need for unifying smart protocols like Matter. The speaker’s stylish retro design provides further appeal, with a chunky foam grille reminiscent of JBL’s ’70s audiophile designs and real knobs for EQ and volume. Most important, the Authentics sounds fantastic, with warm and vibey mids, crisp treble, and wavy bass you can feel through the floor when it gets humming. Sonos models like the Era 100 and Era 300 are top of mind for most seeking an acoustically sound Wi-Fi speaker, but don’t sleep on the 200, especially at this new low price. —Ryan Waniata Bose’s newest Soundlink speaker is also its most expensive, but this sale makes its potent sound and size a lot more approachable. In his review, WIRED contributor Siman Lucas called the Max’s sound “as big, bold, and…upfront as it looks,” touting its penchant for refined bass and uncommon care for the rest of the frequency spectrum. That’s a great mix for a bass-forward model. It also proffers extras like 20 hours of battery life, IP67 weatherproofing, and a slick, travel-friendly design, making it among the very best Bluetooth speakers of its kind. —Ryan Waniata The only real downside to JBL’s best Bluetooth speakers is their high price. Grabbing them on a good sale is key, which makes this Clip 5 deal a top target. The perfect shower speaker does much more than just belt out your morning tunes. Its titular clip makes it easy to bring camping, attach it to your bike, or even clip it on your belt buckle as you clean up your yard or take the dog for a spin. The sound is full and surprisingly warm, with good detail and more bass than most pint-size rivals. Other features include 12 hours of battery (or 15 hours with the battery saver mode) and JBL’s handy app for adjusting the sound or connecting with other JBL models. —Ryan Waniata I loved the new Pill (8/10, WIRED Recommends) at full price, and at $100 or less it’s arguably the best value for a bass-thumping portable out there. The speaker matches musical low-end poise with swift instrumental attacks and vivid high-register detail. At times it pushes toward sharpness, but mainly stays free to provide an exhilarating sound signature with plenty of punch. It adds loads of features, including high-res audio support via USB-C input, one-touch pairing for Android or iOS, and 24 hours of battery life per charge, to make it among the best you can buy. It’s all encapsulated (sorry) in a premium design with IP67 weather protection for outdoor adventures. —Ryan Waniata I tested the R81+ of this Fluance for our Best Turntables guide, which adds a slightly upgraded cartridge and a platter with a more advanced dampener. Still, I would not hesitate to recommend this version, especially at just over $200. The R81’s best features are its solid build quality including a lift-lower mechanism that seems far too good for a turntable at this price. —Martin Cizmar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Fellow Aiden (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the most talked about coffee devices this year. It’s a sleek update on the classic Mr. Coffee from the 1970s: A drip machine to make drip coffee seem kinda cool again. It’s easy to use, it can be customized to each roast or bean with a simple dial twirl, and our reviewer marveled at how good the coffee was. The device is on sale but only if you also buy a bean grinder. Luckily, the Fellow Opus is also the WIRED Gear team’s favorite overall grinder in existence. —Matthew Korfhage The Breville Barista Express is the lowest priced all-in-one espresso maker and frother we’ve found that’ll compete with the thousand-dollar big boys—a sturdy machine with precision, power, grace, and staying power. This is a longtime Gear team favorite: WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu has kept this on his counter for a half-decade. The slightly upgraded Pro version is also on sale this weekend, for about hundred more. —Matthew Korfhage The grinder on this surprisingly svelte KitchenAid machine (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is quite literally the quietest we’ve tested or measured, a whisper of a device that might not wake your significant other or your roommate when you desperately need a 6 am shot. The machine is thoughtfully and intuitively put together, but coffee dosing can be a bit finicky at first: Our Gear team testers noted it might take a few tries before you get it dialed just right. —Matthew Korfhage The Terra Kaffe is a pricey hunk of coffee machinery and has its bugs, but it’s one of few on earth to offer not just quality espresso and macchiato, but also true drip coffee that’s not Americano in disguise. This all arrives in a nifty, easy-to-clean package with a smart screen and all the trimmings. Using a phone app, you can begin warming the machine up from your bed, just like a remote starter on your car. Anyway, it’s a whopping $600 off, with an extra hundo off the top if you sign on for a coffee subscription. —Matthew Korfhage This is the best bean grinder we’ve found under $100, hands down. At the moment, it costs even less than that. At 16 inches high, the Oxo is a little tall to fit under a kitchen cabinet. But it’s durable, and it’s got a slim profile and a truly surprising ability to dial down to fine espresso grinds. —Matthew Korfhage The pricier Fellow or Baratza grinders likely win on overall execution. But what our Gear team testers prized greatly in KitchenAid’s burr grinder was its beauteous ease of cleaning, with burrs accessibly placed just beneath the hopper. Over the life of the product, this can matter more than you expect. We also liked the precise dose control and the helpful guidelines on grind settings. The universal merit of KitchenAid devices kind of tends to just be that they’re considerate of their users: “user-friendly,” to coin a term. Anyway, this is the lowest price we’ve seen on this model. —Matthew Korfhage The Cafe Barista was already our budget pick among fully automated cafe and espresso machines, and right now it’s on significant discount. If you don’t mind the plasticky casing, this low-cost device will make you a rich single or double espresso with a single push of the button, not to mention lattes and cappuccinos. —Matthew Korfhage This is what I use when I make cold brew at home. It’s an elegant, slim-profiled, no-fuss update to the classic Toddy device your favorite cafe probably uses to make a $5 cup of cold brew. Spoon in coffee, pour water over the nifty “rainmaker” top, then let it all sit for 16 to 24 hours. Filtering is as easy as sticking the immersion chamber atop the carafe. It takes patience, but not effort. And the resulting cold brew is delicious. —Matthew Korfhage Do you have a coffee lover on your gift list? Trade coffee is our favorite option for those who want variety, and this deal can get variety delivered to your loved one's door for less. Trade Coffee doesn't roast coffee. Instead, it acts as a middleman between small roasters around the country and you. Trade Coffee makes it possible to get specialty coffee beans from boutique roasters around the US without going on an epic road trip (though that would be a great road trip, so if you have the time, go for it, and send a postcard). —Scott Gilbertson Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Amazon Echo Dot (5th Gen) is truly tiny yet powerful. It’s the Alexa smart speaker I find myself always having set up somewhere in my house, even if I’m testing other voice assistants. This smart speaker might only be a few inches tall, but its audio quality can almost rival the larger Echos. The small footprint makes it easy to add almost anywhere in your home, too. The only downside is the price for such a small speaker, but this sale fixes that. —Nena Farrell If you want a smart display, this is the Goldilocks of the lot. The Echo Show 8 is the perfect size with its 8-inch screen to use for all kinds of features—smart home control, music player, video calls, even a little movie streaming—and packs a great speaker, a smart home hub, and a 13 MP camera. Use it as a digital photo frame, a smart home control center, or just a music jam session. Not only is this smart display fantastic, but it's nearly half off right now and available for the best price we've seen all year. —Nena Farrell The Echo Pop (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the cheapest Amazon Echo speaker on a normal day, and it's the only one you'll find for under $20. It's downright adorable, with a half-moon shape and a couple of fun colors you won't find in other Amazon speakers. It's not the most impressive speaker—no surprise with the smaller form factor it has—but it's not bad for the price, plus you'll get all the usual features of a smart speaker in it. —Nena Farrell Amazon's lineup of smart speakers is huge, but it all started with the true Amazon Echo. The fourth-gen model has an orb shape, rather than the tower of the first few models. But the updated shape also comes with fuller sound that can better fill a room and a built-in smart home hub that can connect to your devices directly over Matter or Zigbee. It's a great speaker and smart assistant, and the twilight blue color is on sale for half off. You can also find the black and white colors on sale for $5 more. —Nena Farrell If you want something just to control your smart home and answer your questions, nothing more, then the Amazon Echo Hub (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is for you. This Amazon Echo speaker is designed to be wall-mounted, and looks like a smart home panel a custom designer would put into your home. Instead of needing your own designer and electricians to set this up, you'll just need your Alexa app and devices that work with it. The Echo Hub isn't meant for any other tricks; it has a speaker, but it's intentionally mediocre, and you'll be prompted to choose a different Amazon Echo in your home to be the primary sound device if you use the Hub for music. It's meant to be a companion to the rest of your existing smart home ecosystem, and as someone who primarily controls her smart home with her speakers, I love it. —Nena Farrell Not to quote my own review, but the Amazon Echo Spot (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is small yet surprisingly helpful. This second-gen model is back after being discontinued, with an updated look that matches the vibe of the Echo Pop that launched last summer (that's on sale too!). I was surprised how much I liked it—it takes my favorite quick-glance smart display features, shows me the weather and my calendar when I ask, and leaves out all of the clutter. It's a solid speaker for casual listening, though the Echo Dot is still the best of the pint-sized Amazon speakers. It's ideal for a bedside table, but I also like it for my desk. It's on sale for almost half off, so it's a great time to get one if you want it. —Nena Farrell Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Canopy is our overall favorite among the suddenly ubiquitous filtered showerheads that now promise to remove all sorts of things from your water, presumably keeping your hair and skin more lustrous. Unlike many such filters, we discovered during testing that the Canopy does in fact remove troublesome chlorine compounds before its spray hits your hair and skin. It's also a good-looking showerhead with multiple spray settings and a lot of considerate touches that make it easy to use. Note that filters require replacement every three months or so, at $25-$35 a pop. —Matthew Korfhage I go through a lot of heat protectants while testing hair straighteners for our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, and R+Co Bleu’s Hypersonic Heat Styling Mist is one of my go-to. It protects up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (also great for hair dryers and curling irons) and goes on kind of thick, like hairspray, so it’s definitely effective at fighting frizz but also isn’t so heavy that it weighs hair down. It also comes in sustainable packaging and is Leaping Bunny certified to be cruelty-free. All of R+Co’s products are 30 percent off, so R+Co’s diatomaceous earth-based Skyline Dry Shampoo is also worth a grab if you need a TSA-compliant dry shampoo for travel or are trying to stay away from aerosols. On the subject of hair products, IGK is also offering 30 percent off everything on its site. While testing for an upcoming guide to the Best Heat Protectants we’ve also become quite fond of IGK’s Good Behavior Smoothing Spray (protects up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit), which is $10 off in the sale. —Kat Merck This was a past budget pick in our electric toothbrush guide, and it’s still a great, affordable toothbrush. It’s cute, thin, and has a gentle cleaning vibration as a sonic toothbrush. It comes with a carrying case, too. —Nena Farrell Sonic toothbrushes are a little gentler than your standard oscillating toothbrush, and the Philips 4100 Sonicare is our favorite sonic toothbrush we’ve tried. We already like the 4100 for all the features it packs at its price point—two intensity levels, a pressure sensor, and a two-minute timer—and those features are an even better deal right now while this toothbrush is on sale. —Nena Farrell The Series 9 is Braun’s ”professional-grade” beard trimmer for the home set, with a quick and secure front control dial to change cut length, long battery life, and an excellent-quality main clipper attachment. Other attachments of equal quality allow tight detail work, or ruler-straight lines and edgework. It is, in short, our favorite overall beard trimmer—and it’s handsomely on sale. —Matthew Korfhage If you love the idea of a multi-tool system like the Dyson AirWrap but can’t stomach shelling out $600, the Shark FlexStyle (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is for you. Like the AirWrap, there are two sets, one for “straight and wavy” and one for “curly and coily,” and both come with two brushes for drying and two barrels for curling. The wand bends at the middle to become a hair dryer that can be used alone or in concert with one of the brush attachments, and it even has one more heat setting than the Dyson—all for literally half the price. WIRED contributor Alanna Martine Kilkeary declared it the Best Multitasking Curler, while former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano deemed it a “near-perfect dupe” of the AirWrap. —Kat Merck Some people (like me) have stubborn hair that will only straighten with a flat iron, but others with more forgiving hair have a wider breadth of options, from hot brushes to air-assisted tools like Dyson’s AirWrap (8/10 WIRED Recommends). Yet another method is via the Tymo Ring, a straightening comb that former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano called in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners a way to take “the curl right out quickly—I didn't have to go over sections more than once or twice.” She also liked the outer shell that covers the hot teeth, so users are able to get closer to their roots without burning themselves. —Kat Merck As detailed in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, this OG Chi is an oldie but a goodie—even though it’s got ceramic plates and only heats up to 392 degrees Fahrenheit, it’s able to successfully smooth a broad range of hair types and textures. It’s lightweight, with 1-inch plates for easy maneuverability and waves, plus it’s got three heat settings and one-hour auto-shutoff for safety. I had one of these straighteners decades ago and it lasted nearly 10 years. Even though this isn’t the greatest sale I’ve ever seen, I still wouldn’t hesitate to buy it again. —Kat Merck This mascara has been my holy grail for years. There are a few drugstore dupes that come close, but in my opinion, nothing beats the real thing. It makes my lashes look long, thick, and velvety in just one coat, and in two coats I might as well be wearing falsies. I also appreciate just how deep and dark the black color is. If you want the most dramatic lashes of your life, this is the way. —Louryn Strampe If you’re looking for an alternative to a blow-dryer brush, the GHD Duet Style is a blow-dryer and flat iron combo that former WIRED contributor Victoria Woollaston-Webber thought worked just as well as the Dyson Airstrait (8/10, WIRED Recommends). Hot air vents through the device’s plates dry hair as it straightens for less damage overall, according to GHD. In our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, Victoria said she especially liked that the Shine Shot Mode could turn off the air and convert it to a traditional hair straightener. —Kat Merck I'm obsessed with blow-dry brushes. The Dyson got me hooked, but I've been pretty darn impressed with the T3 AireBrush on my post-shower hair. I've tried both the round and oval versions, and while I prefer the smaller round option for my chin-length bob, the oval works fantastic too for longer hair or if you like the blowout shape you’d get using a regular hairbrush. Either one is a great purchase, and both are 30 percent off for T3's sale. —Nena Farrell If you know, you know. Aquaphor is like magic. I use it on cracked cuticles, chapped lips, healing tattoos, dry knees, and even on my eyelids when I’m doing a glossy makeup look. This set comes with a travel-friendly 1.7-ounce tube as well as a giant 14-ounce tub. It should be enough to last you through this winter and next, and if you buy it frequently, this is a good deal. —Louryn Strampe With winter around the corner, your lips might start to feel more chapped than usual. This lip mask will help with that. The thick texture melts quickly and sinks straight into your dry skin, leaving your lips feeling less cracked. It also lasts long enough throughout the day that you won't have to constantly reapply the product—so the jar, while small, should last you for a while. —Brenda Stolyar Manscaped is best known for its viral below-the-belt Lawn Mower model. But above the neck, Manscaped’s Beard Hedger has its merits. Specifically, it sports a waterproof body, it’s great for a stubble trim, and its USB-C charger means you can charge it from your phone adapter or laptop. While the Hedger’s design may not be as elegant as some, this all adds up to make it a great travel device. —Matthew Korfhage Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This might just be the most incredible value of 2024. The Moto G Power 5G already impressed me (8/10, WIRED Recommends) earlier this year with its solid performance and 120-Hz LCD screen, not to mention the support for NFC to make contactless payments and even wireless charging. At this $200 discount, it’s a shockingly good Android phone, though its biggest flaw is that it will only receive an update to Android 15, and that’s it. You’ll still get two more years of security updates though. —Julian Chokkattu Flip phones are all the rage. These folding phones work like normal smartphones, but you can fold them in half to stow them in a pocket or purse. What’s not to love? Well, battery life isn’t great (you can just barely eke out a day with average use), but they’re cute and fun, plus Samsung’s build quality is exceptional (7/10, WIRED Recommends). The Galaxy Z Flip6’s external screen isn’t as useful as the cover screen on Motorola’s Razr+, but this is still a well-built flip phone at a reasonable price. —Julian Chokkattu Want a booklike folding phone? My top pick is the Google Pixel 9 Pro, but Samsung’s new Galaxy Z Fold6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is even cheaper! It has excellent build quality (Samsung has been doing this for six years after all), and the external display is wider than before, making it nicer to use. The cameras are great and the screens are bright, though it doesn’t open up to as large a screen as the Pixel. —Julian Chokkattu If, like me, you've been chasing the feeling of using your Blackberry Curve for over a decade now, then I have the accessory for you. It's called the Clicks Keyboard case (8/10, WIRED Recommends) and it's the first-of-its-kind iPhone case with a built-in keyboard. It's a great option for someone who relies on their phone for tasks like sending off emails, typing up documents, responding to Slack messages, and more. It'll take a while to get used to the tactile keys though—days or weeks depending on how quickly you build up muscle memory. We also only recommend it for the iPhone 16 lineup. It comes with a redesigned keyboard, a slightly more durable design, and support for MagSafe and CarPlay. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Series 10 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the latest model to join Apple's lineup. It also holds the top spot in our guide to the Best Apple Watches. Compared to its predecessor, it not only has a bigger display, but it's also thinner, lighter, and packs support for fast charging. The smartwatch also runs WatchOS 11, so you'll have access to features like Vitals (to check your baseline every morning) and Training Load (to see how your workouts are impacting your fitness over time). It's worth noting that it doesn't pack a blood oxygen sensor, though. —Brenda Stolyar The Ultra 2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our top pick for outdoor sports. Under the hood is an S9 chip for faster performance and an ultra-wideband chip with enhanced precision finding. You'll also have access to dual-frequency GPS, offline maps (that you'll have to download to your iPhone), and Backtrack for creating virtual breadcrumb trails on the Compass app via the Action button. —Brenda Stolyar The best running watch will probably always be a Garmin Forerunner. The line ranges from the barebones Forerunner 55 to the spendy Forerunner 965 for triathlons, but I think the Forerunner 165 has pretty much everything you need. The more you spend, the more sensors you get, and the Forerunner 165 has blood oxygen sensing plus a barometric altimeter, compass, and ambient light sensor, in addition to the now-standard fall detection and multiple satellite positioning systems. —Adrienne So Yes, the price is lower now that the new Oura Ring 4 has been released. But I wore the Oura Ring Gen3 for many years and found it to be accurate, attractive, and comfortable (once all the features it had promised in 2021 became available). Some days, I even find myself missing the three little bump optical sensors on the back of my ring. This is a pretty remarkable deal for a one-of-a-kind fitness tracker that started a whole product category all by itself. —Adrienne So There are a few pretty great Fitbit deals going on right now, but if you have kids, I suggest going for the Fitbit Ace LTE. Unlike the Apple Watch, it’s not phone-specific, so your kid can use it even if you and your spouse are an Android/iPhone family (if so, why?). It has a ton of fun, movement-based games that are an incentive for your kid to actually remember to charge your watch and keep it on. I understand that feelings are mixed on giving kids smart devices, but it helps us all keep track of each other as my kids walk around the neighborhood and it stops me from having to text everyone else’s parents all the time. —Adrienne So Samsung tried to make a squircle-shaped Apple Watch Ultra competitor and it’s … OK (7/10, WIRED Review). The company also targeted Apple-like pricing, but the Galaxy Watch Ultra didn’t have complete feature parity and its software isn’t as polished. Still, this is a powerful smartwatch with a few extra features over the company’s standard Galaxy Watch7, and it’s much more reasonably priced with this discount, which ends on December 1. —Julian Chokkattu The latest iteration of Samsung’s Galaxy Watch series has some artificial intelligence algorithms to improve your health tracking data, like giving you a comprehensive Energy Score and updated sleep tracking abilities. It can also detect if you have sleep apnea. However, editor Julian Chokkattu found battery life frustrating compared to older models, and it’s worth noting you won’t get the full functionality unless you pair it with a Samsung phone. —Adrienne So The OnePlus Watch 2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) had one job: stand out from other Wear OS smartwatches, and it succeeded. Unlike Samsung’s Galaxy Watch7 or Google’s Pixel Watch 3, OnePlus prioritized battery life over all else, and thanks to a clever dual-processor and dual-operating system hybrid architecture, the Watch 2 can last roughly three days on a single charge. Hooray! The health tracking isn’t its strong suit, but this is a Wear OS smartwatch so you’ll find many rich smart features, though it’s only compatible with Android phones. You can save even more by going with the OnePlus Watch 2R for $170 ($60 off), which has a screen that doesn’t get as bright, no sapphire crystal coating over the glass, and an aluminum build over stainless steel. —Julian Chokkattu This is still the watch that I would wear if I didn’t have to test other fitness trackers—and I’m not the only one, because Garmin’s Instinct line is one of the company’s most popular. It has all the backcountry capabilities of the higher-end Fenix and Epix lines, but it’s more affordable because it ditches the fancy screen. The Instinct 2 Solar’s battery life lasted almost three weeks when I tested it in Hawaii, where I used it to keep track of everything from trail runs to keeping me oriented toward the beach when snorkeling. —Adrienne So The Fitbit Charge 6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) tops our guide to the best fitness trackers thanks to the perfect balance of attractiveness, affordability, accessibility, and ease of use. Google’s takeover has led to several smart integrations with Google Maps, Google Wallet, and YouTube Music Premium. This tracker can keep tabs on your skin temperature, 24/7 heart rate, activities, and sleep schedule. You can also expect week-long battery life, but the best features still require the $10/month Fitbit Premium subscription. —Simon Hill Garmin recently combined its two high-end Epix and Fenix lines in the updated Fenix 8 series, which we will be including in our Best Fitness Trackers roundup. However, if you have no particular need for voice commands or new, leakproof buttons for scuba, the second-gen Epix Pro is still a great buy, and it’s now much cheaper! Use the beautiful AMOLED screen to access Garmin’s detailed proprietary maps. And I’m a little embarrassed by how much I like the onboard flashlight. —Adrienne So Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This isn't technically a deal, but retailers are currently offering Batman: Arkham Shadow and three months of Meta Quest+, its game subscription program, through April 2025. If you've never tried a VR headset and you're curious, this is one of the best and easiest ways to start playing loads of games to see if you like it. We also think the Quest 3S is one of the cheapest and lightest ways to get into gaming (it will still make you slightly nauseous if you're not used to it, though.) —Adrienne So This is our top gaming headset recommendation because it uses Logitech’s Lightspeed connection system (with a 2.4-GHz dongle) for low-latency audio (important when playing fast-paced games). You can also use Bluetooth if you’d like, or jack in with the 3.5-mm headphone jack. That makes it more versatile than ever. The boom mic arm is detachable so you can wear this out of the house without feeling like you’re headed to a call center. Our previous top pick was the G Pro X 2’s predecessor, and it’s also on sale for $81 ($19 off). But that one’s a wired headset so you have fewer connectivity options. —Julian Chokkattu As the younger sibling to the impressive HyperX Cloud Alpha, these boast an incredible 120 hours of claimed battery life, in some cases four times its competitors. That truly astounding number is backed up by crisp sound quality and a high level of compatibility. The included USB-C dongle and USB-A adapter let you plug them into almost any system you can find, so nothing will stand between you and your games, particularly having to recharge. —Brad Bourque The PlayStation VR2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the best VR headsets, featuring a comfortable, adjustable headband, excellent eye-tracking that allows you to select menu items or track objects by looking at them, and it comes with two controllers. If you crave immersion, you’ll find it here. The headset requires a PS5 and this is a tasty discount, but we recommend going for the PlayStation VR2 Horizon Call of The Mountain Bundle ($349) since it is the same price and includes one of the best PS VR2 games in Horizon Call of the Mountain. —Simon Hill Our favorite gaming headset for multi-platform gamers, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X supports almost every modern system under the sun, including the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and basically anything else with a USB-C port or Bluetooth. It’s also super comfortable for long gaming sessions, with plush ear cups and the classic SteelSeries support band. At just $100, these very well might be your favorite new pair of wireless gaming headphones. —Brad Bourque The PlayStation 5 Slim is a slimmed-down version of the PlayStation 5 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) that’s around 30 percent slimmer. It runs the same list of great PS5 games but takes up less space beneath the TV. We have a breakdown of the different PlayStation 5 models if you want to dive deeper, but the PS5 Slim is the only one on sale and a 15 percent discount is decent if you’re in the market for a Sony console. —Simon Hill Even at its full price of $40, the Logitech G203 feels like a solid deal, but for half that, it’s a downright steal. It has six programmable buttons, full support for the Logitech G Hub software, and RGB lighting—what else could you ask for? The only real compromise here is the 8,000 DPI max, but as long as you can live with that, this is a great budget-friendly gaming mouse or a perfect backup mouse for traveling or emergencies. —Brad Bourque Compact gaming keyboards like the Razer Huntsman Mini make a lot of sense for gamers with limited desk space. As long as you can live without a num pad or arrow keys, you’ll find all the features you’d expect from a full size offering in this compact keyboard. That includes Razer’s excellent software support, keycap compatibility, and excellent build quality. All that adds up to a big deal on a small board, and it’s just part of the reason the Razer Huntsman Mini is our favorite small keyboard. —Brad Bourque With a million mechanical keyboards on the market, it can be tough to stand out, but the Corsair K100 does just that with its built-in control wheel. This programmable knob can adjust keyboard lighting or other built-in keyboard functions, but more fun is the option to set it to control media playback on your system. You’ll also get RGB backlighting, a volume control wheel, and a set of macro keys along the left side, all features we’d expect from a mechanical keyboard at this price point. —Brad Bourque The Steam Deck might be all about portable handheld gaming, but sometimes you just wanna plug it into a bigger screen, just like a Nintendo Switch, especially if you want to play a game with a keyboard and mouse. This aluminum Jsaux 7-in-1 Steam Deck Dock will do the job, with three USB-A ports, a DisplayPort, an HDMI, a USB-C, and even an Ethernet port. —Julian Chokkattu I didn’t think I’d love Disney Dreamlight Valley when I first installed it, but it quickly became one of my favorite cozy games. It’s fantastic on the Nintendo Switch but available for other consoles. It’s a life sim where you’ll run around collecting items, farming crops, fishing, and decorating, but it also has a surprisingly grown-up storyline that might entice even those of us who don’t have fond memories of Disney movies or shows. The Cozy Edition comes with bonus cosmetics that you don’t get with the base game. Pro tip: Plant all the pumpkins. —Louryn Strampe It’s always nice to see a solid deal on our favorite keyboard. The Logitech G Pro X TKL Lightspeed might have a mouthful of a name, but it’s as streamlined and stylish as they come. It sports bright backlit keys with your standard RGB setup, wireless connectivity, and a minimal, high quality design that fits right in on any desk. Beyond media controls and some buttons for functionality, the G Pro X TKL packs just the right features, and leaves the rest on the cutting room floor, which is why we like it. —Brad Bourque If you’re looking for a simple joystick for gaming, it’s hard to beat the value on the Logitech G Extreme 3D Pro USB Joystick. It isn’t the fanciest, and its plastic construction won’t impress true enthusiasts, but you’ll spend two or three times the price to get anything similar from a manufacturer as reputable as Logitech. It also sports a huge number of buttons, both on the handle and on the base, and a throttle slider that’s not as common on joysticks at this price point. That makes it the perfect joystick for a quick flight in Microsoft Flight Simulator or a few hours of space trucking in Elite Dangerous. —Brad Bourque The hardest console gamers know that quick reactions can be the difference between total glory and complete failure, so give yourself every advantage with the SCUFInstinct Pro controller for Xbox. This upgraded controller features improved materials for grip and comfort, plus a more premium build quality, but the best part is hidden around back. Four programmable paddles allow you to put your most important buttons right at your fingertips for lightning-fast access, giving you the ultimate edge against anyone who has to move their hand to hit the melee button. —Brad Bourque Our favorite USB microphone is sporting a decent discount, as it is fairly often. The Blue Yeti has a long history on the desks of streamers and podcasters, and for good reason. It sports solid audio performance, great build quality, and easy access to controls. That makes it a great option for anyone looking to upgrade from their gaming headset’s microphone, or to pair with some better headphones. —Brad Bourque This Intel Core i7-14700K 8-Core 5.6 GHz (LGA 1700 Socket) chip is a very solid performer and will work with any 700-series chipset-based motherboard. It'll get you through heavy workday tasks like video editing with ease and can handle 4K gaming. —Scott Gilbertson This is one of the best game controllers for PC gamers, with five central buttons on the front, a pair of rear paddles, and plenty of customization options. 8BitDo’s software lets you remap buttons, tweak the stick and trigger sensitivity, assign macros, and tune the vibration intensity. It’s compact with a grippy texture on the handles, satisfyingly clicky triggers, and a decent D-pad. There’s a 2.4G dongle in the handy charging dock for PC gaming, and battery life is around 20 hours. It also has Bluetooth support for Nintendo Switch players, making this a solid alternative to the Switch Pro controller. —Simon Hill Feel free to take $40 off the reasonably equipped Gigabyte B650, a mid-range AMD Ryzen motherboard with support for DDR5 RAM, 2.5Gbps Ethernet, and USB 3.2 Gen 2x2. While it isn’t the highest-end offering, notably missing PCIe 5.0, it still supports overclocking, and even has built-in Wi-Fi for easy connectivity. Make sure to check out our PC building guide for more info on what you should be looking for when purchasing a motherboard. —Brad Bourque Western Digital also makes excellent SSDs, and this one is no exception. The SN 770 M.2 2280 achieved speeds of 5,100 Mbps in my testing, which is blazing fast. If you're doing a lot of drive-intensive tasks, like editing video or gaming, this drive is well worth the money. The largest version you can get is 2 TB, but the price is reasonable considering the speed increase. —Scott Gilbertson Viture's Pro XR Glasses make for a great portable gaming display you can take anywhere. They have a large, virtual screen (135 inches), a smooth 120-Hz frame rate, and a maximum brightness of 4,000 nits. The company has done a solid job with the software too and tailored the experience for gamers. You can also, however, use these for watching movies or multitasking work. However, it's worth noting the Harman-tuned speakers are limited. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This LifeStraw has been featured in many an iteration of our outdoorsy gift guide (though we’ve replaced it this year). Nevertheless, it’s a good product. This LifeStraw can screw onto a plastic water bottle or be used as a straw to slurp up water from basically anywhere. It filters out at least 99.99 percent of bacteria, microplastics, and other gross contaminants. If you’re shopping for a prepper this holiday season, or you’re just like me and ill-prepared for the zombie apocalypse, this deal is worth checking out. —Louryn Strampe The Leatherman Wave+ is our top pick multi-tool. The tools flip out and retract with just the right mix of smoothness and tension, and the mix of tools here is very useful—two stainless steel knives, one with a straight edge and the other serrated, along with 16 other tools, including a wood-and-metal file, a diamond-coated file, a saw, Phillips screwdriver bits, scissors, an 8-inch ruler, and a wire stripper, as well as a bottle and can opener. The Branwyn bra is in our essential guide to merino wool, but I like it enough that I wrote a whole separate rave about it. Merino wool is a miracle fiber—it’s renewable, odor-resistant, regulates your temperature and doesn’t leave you with a terminal case of swamp booty should you choose to jump in a river with your hiking clothes on. What’s not to like? Everything at Branwyn is 25 percent off through December 3 (just add to your basket to see the discount). —Adrienne So I love my pellet smoker for cooking everything from meat to pizza—as does WIRED reviewer Scott Gilbertson in our guide to the Best Grills—which is why I highly recommend this Traeger. It can connect to Wi-Fi for easy monitoring of longer cooks, and features the classic easy-to-clean Traeger design that made the brand an icon in the first place. —Parker Hall The Breeo is the most overbuilt option on our best fire pits guide and wins our favor by opening the door to a complete ecosystem of products including a live-fire pizza oven and a flat-top grill for making smashburgers. This is a sizable sale on the pit. —Martin Cizmar Like the Coleman above, the RoadTrip 225 allows you to use only one burner, so you can grill a couple of burgers without draining your propane tank. With variable controls, you can sear veggies on one side while cooking meat more slowly on the other. There's a grease pan to catch drips while cooking, and it's removable for cleaning. You also get push-button ignition and 11,000 BTUs of propane grilling power. At this price, it's hard to beat these features. —Louryn Strampe Cupping therapy can be intimidating, but the TheraCup makes bringing spa-level treatment at home easy. It blends suction, heat, and vibration to mimic the effects of traditional cupping therapy. I’ve found it user-friendly, and with its auto-shutoff and safety sensors, I don’t have to worry about overdoing it. At $129 ($20 off), it’s a solid investment that will save you from splurging on professional sessions. —Boutayna Chokrane If you’re tired of itchy or sweaty socks, these Carhartts are a solid upgrade. WIRED’s self-proclaimed sock-hating outdoorsman, Scott Gilbertson, is living proof that these socks can convert even the most dedicated barefooters. He’d rather brave the snow wearing a pair of sandals; that is, until he was gifted the Carhartt Midweight Merino Wool Blend Crew Socks. These woolies are designed to keep your feet warm, dry, and odor-free—even after a full day of hiking. The midweight design strikes the ideal balance between breathability and insulation, perfect for year-round excursions. —Boutayna Chokrane The LifePro Sonic Massage Gun proves you don’t need to spend a fortune for a deep-tissue massage. With eight included attachments—yes, eight—it’s the most versatile massager we’ve tried. It’s more than capable of working even the most stubborn knots, and with five intensity levels, don’t worry about whether it packs a punch. —Boutayna Chokrane The PowerDot 2.0 Muscle Stimulator is a recent addition to my recovery routine. It pairs with your smartphone to provide personalized muscle recovery and strength training, and ease menstrual cramps. When I first tried it, I expected a sharp zap, but the sensation was surprisingly soothing, like a prickly, customizable massage. The Duo is ideal for multiple or larger areas, and it comes with everything you need: electrode pads, lead cables, a charger, and a carrying case. Note: I’ve encountered some connectivity hiccups with the app, and online reviews suggest I’m not alone. Still, when it works, it’s brilliant. —Boutayna Chokrane Niu’s scooters have long been reliable for me, with simple folding mechanisms and a comfy riding experience. That continues with the KQi 300X, a 49-pound escooter with 10.5-inch tubeless tires, regenerative braking, and a 16-mile range in my tests (I’m 6’4”, so you can probably go even further.) This one has turn signals too, though they are not time-based and need to be turned off manually. Still, this is one of the lower prices I’ve seen and great value. —Julian Chokkattu A sub-$3000 electric mountain bike is amazing, and Aventon’s version has incredible specs for the price point. Reviewer Steph Pearson was impressed by its smooth, consistent power. Its weight is a bit much (OK, it’s a lot) for technical singletrack, but if you have a commute that incorporates steep hills, dirt roads, or potholes, it’s the perfect ride.—Adrienne So If you just want something for quick trips to the grocery store or just puttering around your neighborhood, the Segway E2 Pro is probably more than enough. It’s affordable, even more so now with this deal, and the 350-watt motor does a decent job with small slopes. It’s 41 pounds, but you get tubeless tires, good brakes, and a 15-mph top speed. I usually managed a little under 10 miles. It’s also rare to see turn signals on an affordable scooter, which is a nice perk. Want to save even more? I’ve also tested the E2 Plus, which is now $280 ($70 off). It’s lighter and slower, but it does the job for short trips. —Julian Chokkattu I’ve now tested more than 50 pickleball paddles to make our guide to the best, but I have a soft spot for the SLK Evo, which was the first nice paddle I bought with my own money. It has a nice neutral feel and a great grip. You won’t be able to get much top spin off the fiberglass face, but it’s fine for anyone below the advanced level. —Martin Cizmar This inflatable hot tub is nice! The Coleman SaluSpa Ibiza (7/10, WIRED Review) is easy to set up and generally user-friendly. It takes a while to heat up, but when it’s rolling, it’s a great place to relax and unwind. The pump module has built-in cupholders and there are optional air jets to bubble away all of your worries. It’s got room for four to six people, though I think six would be a bit too cozy. Just make sure you have the space for it before purchasing. —Louryn Strampe Movement begets more movement! WIRED contributor Kristin Canning would have paid even full price for this walking pad. It feels good underfoot (she often walks on it wearing just socks), isn’t annoyingly loud, and doesn’t shake her standing desk. You can control it with both the remote or the app, and Canning prefers the app as the Bluetooth connectivity can get a bit wonky. —Adrienne So No one I know has ever regretted getting a walking pad. It helps even the least motivated of us get a little more movement into our day. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano noted that the Egofit is compact and easy to use and move. You can control it with a remote, and the digital screen displays time, calories burned, distance walked, steps, and walking speed (be warned, though, there is no pause button). —Adrienne So In our Smart Bird Feeders Buying Guide, we recommend this model as the prettiest, and we also like that it’s made with less plastic than other feeders. This bamboo Netvue Birdfy (6/10, WIRED Review) features an extendable perch and two large bins for bird seeds, and it includes a solar panel so you won’t need to charge or replace the batteries. The included 1080p camera will show you video feeds and pictures of bird visitors. You can pay more to get a lifetime subscription with AI that’ll help identify birds—though sometimes it gets it wrong. Note that, although it’s rot- and mold-resistant, it does need to be sealed with a bird-safe wood sealer. —Louryn Strampe This adorable stroller takes the features of a full-size stroller and packs them into a smaller package. The Thule Shine’s (9/10, WIRED Recommends) adjustable handlebar works for a huge variety of heights—both my 5’ mom and my 6'4" dad could comfortably push my son around in this stroller thanks to the five different height options, and the stroller can switch to do inward or outward facing and has accessories for car seats and a bassinet. It's one of my favorite full-sized strollers I've ever tried, and it's on sale for a nice discount. —Nena Farrell In our Best Treadmills roundup, WIRED contributor Kristin Canning notes that the incline ranges on the BowFlex Treadmill 22 are much greater than our top pick, the NordicTrack. That means it’s ideal for hill training, or if it’s dark and late outside and you can’t make yourself drive anywhere to prep for an upcoming road race. Bowflex has its own proprietary fitness programming with both on- and off-tread options, but you can also stream your own shows and movies, too. —Adrienne So Even if we weren’t always scaling rugged peaks, we used Rocky Talkies on almost every camping trip—you need a better way to talk to your family besides running around and yelling. Rocky Talkies have a few advantages over cheap walkies. They come with a carabiner to clip on your pack or clothes, so they don’t slide off; the battery life is much better, and it’s much easier to use. The push-to-talk button is even recessed so you don’t accidentally transmit your shit-talking. The waterproof mic and extra battery are also on sale. —Adrienne So We're huge fans of the Peloton Tread, it's actually one of the best home treadmills we've tested so far. It's sleek and beautiful, so it won't be an eyesore in your house and you'll have access to some of the most engaging fitness programming out there—complete with great music, top-tier instructors, and fun workouts. If you're more interested in one of the company's bikes, those are also on sale for up to $700. —Brenda Stolyar Jumping rope is one of the best ways to get an intense cardio workout without needing a lot of space, and Crossrope is one of the most fun ways to do it. It builds strength in the shoulders, forearms, and legs, and doing double-unders, crossovers, or other complicated steps is just fun. Subscribe to the app, get access to 2,500 workouts and over 35 different fitness programs, watch videos, and use your Bluetooth-connected jump rope to really show those CrossFitters what’s what. —Adrienne So Nothing can possibly fix you as much as cold plunges can, but devotees of the practice will tell you otherwise. Sun Home’s premium version is the only portable cold plunge tub that’s capable of getting to as low as 33 degrees, which you will need once you’ve acclimated to 40 degrees and need to get even colder to chase that euphoric high. It’s also sturdy, chills water quickly, and surprisingly, doesn’t add too much to your electricity bill.—Adrienne So Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals If you’re in the market for a travel bag, the Dagne Dover Petra Convertible Tote is a chameleon of carryalls. It’s part backpack, part tote, and even has a luggage pass-through that is a back-saver during long treks through airports. At nearly 17 inches tall, this bag is big, but it still fits under most airplane seats. We’re particularly fond of the padded compartments, offering extra protection for your tech gear and one less thing to worry about while rushing to your gate. —Boutayna Chokrane I love Calpak's clear cosmetic cases. They were viral for a reason, since it's easy to see where everything is thanks to the clear design, and the two separate sides make it easy to keep it from becoming a massive mess inside the bag. While the clear cases come in three sizes, only the largest size is on sale. WIRED editor Kat Merck didn’t find this case the easiest to travel with while reviewing it for the Best Toiletry Bags guide, but I use the medium-sized bag for my daily makeup. The large case is a great choice if you have a lot of makeup and skincare you're looking to easily store and keep organized. There are a couple colors that are 30 percent off, but most are 20 percent off, which is still a good deal. —Nena Farrell A carry-on is a highly personalized purchase—it’s both an accessory and one of the bags that endures the most abuse when you use it. Aer’s is more expensive than some of our other picks, but I particularly liked Aer’s for a few reasons. The polycarbonate surface doesn’t pick up dirt as easily as the Monos, and it doesn’t have ridges like the Beis. It also has specialized Hinamoto metal ball bearings for smoother rolling, as well as wheel locks, so it doesn’t slide all over the place when you have to take it on a shuttle. All of Aer’s luggage is 25 percent off through Dec. 2, but you’ll need to enter a SAVE20 discount code to get the deal. —Adrienne So Staying hydrated feels almost effortless with the Owala 40-ounce tumbler. We love Owalas for a few reasons: They’re free of BPA, lead, and phthalates, which should be a minimum standard for reusable water bottles. Owala’s trademark 2-in-1 lid makes this tumbler work with hot, cold, and carbonated beverages. And Owala’s limited-edition color palettes are dangerously addictive, making it hard not to grab one in every shade. So, if you’re eyeing a certain design, there’s no time like the present. —Boutayna Chokrane Several WIRED Gear team members use the Front-Range Harness. While I use the attachment point at the top behind my pup’s head, my colleague uses the bottom one, so if her dog Roux chases after a squirrel and pulls on the leash, he’ll just spin and face her. It has reflective strips for increased visibility and there’s padding for the undersides so they don’t dig in. They’re well-made and have held up after years of use. —Julian Chokkattu Some travel mugs dent if you so much as look at them wrong, but not the Hydro Flask. Its signature powder-coated exterior is as durable as it is sleek. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano has been using hers for years without a single ding, making it a reliable choice for your busiest days and clumsiest moments. Plus, no lead here—unlike certain other tumblers we know (looking at you, Stanley). —Boutayna Chokrane Editor Kat Merck is obsessed with the Dagne Dover Mila Toiletry Organizer, which she uses for her cosmetics. Made from recycled materials, it’s sustainable, water-resistant, and easy to clean. Merck especially loves the thoughtful compartments: the carabiner for jewelry, the zippered pouch for hair ties and bobby pins, and the elastic loops for makeup brushes. The sections can feel snug for more than two full-sized products but are perfect for travel-sized essentials. P.S., the small model is also on sale for $38. —Boutayna Chokrane An honorable mention in our guide to the Best Toiletry Bags, this toiletry kit is a decent option for those who want a simple, well-made bag that can either hang or lay flat. There’s a snap-in plastic envelope for soap or a toothbrush, and the navy version I tested is made from recycled bottles. I wasn’t especially impressed with the bag’s organizational components in comparison to its size, and I didn’t like that the bag’s thick, small plastic hook couldn’t hang on a towel rack, but otherwise, I had no major complaints during my weeks of testing. It should also be noted this bag comes in almost 20 different colors and prints, from metallic pink to a basketball motif, so at this price it would make a great gift for adults and kids alike. —Kat Merck The Travelrest Nest Ultimate Travel Pillow (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is nearly perfect. The back is flat, which keeps your spine aligned, whereas the sides and front are high and firm, which keeps your neck supported. The microfiber cover is soft and machine washable, and the memory foam cover holds its shape without compressing too much. We just wish the stuff sack had an attachment point for easier toting around. —Louryn Strampe Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Our favorite mirrorless camera, Sony's A7 IV (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is a 33-megapixel, full-frame camera capable of incredibly sharp images, with excellent dynamic range and great autofocus, and it's smaller than most of its competitors. There's five-axis image stabilization built-in, and it can shoot 7K oversampled 4K/30 fps video. —Scott Gilbertson The A7R V is the highest-resolution stills camera on the market (unless you opt for medium-format cameras). If that's not enough, there's a 16-shot, high-resolution mode that can create 240-MP images (so long as your subject is static, e.g., a landscape). The dynamic range is outstanding, and the autofocus speeds and smarts are some of the best we've seen. The only down side is the file size; fully uncompressed RAW files from this sensor run around 125 megabytes per image, though there are compressed options that will get them down to about 80 MP per image. —Scott Gilbertson GoPro's new Hero 13 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a fantastic action camera. The Hero 13 features a new interchangeable lens system, with Macro, Ultra Wide, and Anamorphic lenses, plus a set of four neutral density filters (all sold separately). The Hero 13 Black even autodetects which lens is attached and changes settings accordingly. It's a slick, if expensive, system, but this deal at least saves you some cash on the base camera, which you can put toward an extra lens. Except the Anamorphic, which won't be available until 2025. —Scott Gilbertson This deal has been running since the new Hero 13 Black launched earlier this year, and if you have the extra $40 to spare, I highly recommend the Hero 13 over the 12. But if you're on a tight budget, or just don't have any interest in the interchangeable lenses, the Hero 12 uses the same sensor and makes a great action cam. —Scott Gilbertson The DJI Air 3 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) remains one of our favorite drones, despite the brand new Air 3S. The new Air 3S brings larger sensors, which do improve the video a bit, but the Air 3 is still a fantastic dual-camera drone and, at this price, a better value than the new Air 3S. —Scott Gilbertson The Osmo Action 4 has been surpassed by the new Osmo Action 5, but the Action 4 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is still a fantastic action camera, especially at this price. The magnetic mounting system is great, the menu system makes switching between modes a snap, and the resulting photos and video are excellent. —Scott Gilbertson Insta360's Ace Pro was just replaced by the new Ace Pro 2, but this is a good deal on what is still a great camera. Capable of recording up to 8K 24 fps, with solid stabilization, good color handling, and a Leica lens to boot, there's a lot to love here, especially for only $300. That said, unless you think you're going to use the 8K (which is really only usable in still shots, not action footage), the Osmo Action 4 deal above is a better value. —Scott Gilbertson Our favorite 360 camera, Insta360's X4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends), features a 1/2-inch sensor capable of 8K video, which is as high-resolution as you can get in a 360-degree camera. The 8K resolution means you can reframe your footage to fit rectangular video formats and still have high-quality clips sharp enough to mix with other sources. It doesn’t reframe to 4K (you'll have to wait for 12K footage before that's possible), but it's good enough for anything you'd put on social media. —Scott Gilbertson The Insta360 Go 3S (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is just plain fun. It's a hybrid camera that transforms from a traditional action-camera form factor to a more portable go-anywhere wearable camera. In action camera mode, it's much like the Ace Pro above. The sensor isn't as big so the image quality isn't as good, but you get the flip-up rear screen. The camera itself is waterproof to 33 feet (10 meters). The case can also continue to act as a remote monitor even when you pull the camera out. Couple that with the extremely strong magnetic mounting system on the camera pod, and the Go 3 becomes capable of shots and angles that no other action camera can match. —Scott Gilbertson If you want an instant camera and don't want to spend a lot, the Instax Mini 12 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is your best bet. It's a capable, easy-to-use camera wrapped in a colorful, bubbly design. One thing you'll find here that's missing even on more expensive models is parallax correction. That means you don't have to guess where the center of the frame is for close-up subjects. What you see is what you get, eliminating those accidentally ill-framed close-ups that sometimes happen with other instant cameras. —Scott Gilbertson The Sprocket Photo Printer offers the best results of the ink mini printers we've tested. It's roughly the size of a phone and connects with iPhone, iPad, or Android phones via Bluetooth. The mobile app lets you edit and customize your photos before printing. There's also an option to tile your images onto multiple prints for a larger, pieced-together image. —Scott Gilbertson The Polaroid Now+ has the typical features you'd expect from a Polaroid: vintage aesthetics, roll-out film, and a nice chunky body with easy-to-find buttons. What sets it apart is the smartphone companion app, which gives you the option to use features like Tripod Mode, Manual Mode, or setting a custom f-stop in Aperture Priority Mode. The Now+ also lets you take double exposures. It's pricey but it offers a good blend of modern methods and vintage execution. —Scott Gilbertson The Flir One Gen 3 is the largest of the thermal cameras we've tested. It’s about 2.6 inches wide and 1.3 inches tall, and it fits a lot into that space, including a built-in battery and two cameras. The first is the IF camera which captures 80 x 60-pixel images and then combines them with the second camera, which grabs a higher resolution image of visible light, which the device smooths and scales up to a nice, pretty clear, 1,440 x 1,080-pixel image. —Scott Gilbertson Our favorite place to print photos is having a 30 percent off sale on its print services. Mpix makes high-quality prints at a reasonable price even when it's full price, which makes this a great deal. Mpix prints on Kodak Endura paper and offers a variety of paper options. I tested the E-surface, which renders rich, deep blacks and true-to-life colors. It holds up well over time; the images we printed in 2013 look exactly like they did when we got them. We also like Mpix's books and calendars. —Scott Gilbertson If you need to print gifts for your family, Shutterfly is having a sitewide 50 percent off sale. We're fans of Shutterfly's book printing service, which had the best results so far in our testing of photo printing services. We also like the calendars. The printing is good enough, especially for the price, and shipping is generally speedy. —Scott Gilbertson

No offers found There are 300 Quest 3 games or bundles discounted on the Quest Store by our count; we've chosen 25 across genres for every VR gamer. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta had discounted about 300 Quest 3 or 2 games through December 3 at 10a Pacific. That means you have through Cyber Monday to stock up on games that normally retail for $20–40, so you're liable to save $10 or more with every purchase. This Quest Store link should take you to the full list of on-sale titles, which are all 40% off with the code BFCM24. Everyone else can check their regional store for a Black Friday or Cyber Monday category. If you're still on the hunt for a Meta Quest 3 or Quest 3S, we've found several Cyber Monday deals that come with free gift cards or accessories! One of which includes free Meta Quest credit that can be used toward games here. Below, I've rounded up some of the best Quest games across every category, to help you narrow down that 300-game list to those that our staff has personally played and enjoyed! Or you can check out our best Quest games list for guidance — though not every game on that list is discounted. If you want to narrow down that list even further, games like Pistol Whip or Superhot are shooters that really familiarize you with VR gameplay but keep you rooted in one spot so you don't have to move around the world, avoiding any VR sickness for beginners. Games like LEGO: Bricktales or Espire 2 will let you try out mixed reality and keep an eye on your real-world surroundings, while Vacation Simulator and Walkabout Mini Golf are great cozy experiences. If you want to use VR to get fit, Creed is the obvious choice for punching and weaving, but other games like Racket: Nx and Underdogs will accidentally work you out while you're having too much fun to notice. And for the most traditional multiplayer excitement, Breachers or Contractors Showdown will feel familiar to COD fans. Many of the biggest AAA Quest games aren't eligible for the 40% discount, but I've noticed that if you click on a link for full-price games like Batman: Arkham Shadow or Assassin's Creed Nexus, you may see a 20% "Holiday promotion" pop-up (see the screenshot) for any game if you click on a third-party link. Hopefully these links will work, and you can save a little extra! Otherwise, if you're a new or current Quest 3 / Quest 3S owner, check out our guide on the best Quest 3 accessories!

Title: This KIWI design Meta Quest 3 and 3S accessory adds 2.5 hours to your playtime

Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? Two of the biggest gripes I have with my family’s new Meta Quest 3S — if you can really call them that — can be solved in one go, with a pretty useful accessory. First, the stock head strap is uncomfortable and I wish the battery life were just a little better. Well, KIWI Design has a Meta Quest 3 and 3S accessory that fixes both of those quirks. The K4 Boost comfort strap also includes a built-in battery that adds an extra 2.5 hours of playtime. It’s more comfortable to wear, too. But here’s the best part: It’s only $40 in a Cyber Monday deal. Normally $70, that saves you $30. And don’t fret if you think you missed out on the best Cyber Monday deals, many of them are still available to shop, like this one. The KIWI Design K4 Boost is both a comfort-oriented strap and a battery life extender thanks to a built-in battery. You get an extra 2.5 to 3 hours of wireless playtime while it’s charged. Moreover, it supports dual fast charging so both the battery and the Quest unit charge with minimal delays. One of the more useful features of this headstrap is the adjustment system. You can easily take the Meta Quest 3 or 3S off, readjust the strap, and put it back on. That also goes for swapping players, which can be a tad frustrating when you’re using the stock strap. That’s because on the KIWI straps you use a rear-mounted dial that’s as simple as twisting a knob. You put the headset on, twist the knob to tighten the strap and that’s it. It’s super simple and you’ll be amazed at how fast and how well it works. I was too. You don’t have to worry about the strap adding too much weight to the whole setup either. Even with the battery, it’s relatively light at 0.8 pounds. That still gives you plenty of maneuverability while wearing the headset. Anything that would bog down the set and your head would make moving around more difficult. That’s certainly not the case here. Plus, a little added weight is a decent trade-off for more playtime. I’ve noticed during use that my family burns through the battery pretty fast, especially while playing some Beat Saber. For Cyber Monday, the price of the KIWI Design K4 Boost headset is now $40, normally $70. That’s a great offer on a fantastic Meta Quest 3 and 3s accessory. Connections is one of the best puzzle games from the New York Times. The game tasks you with categorizing a pool of 16 words into four secret (for now) groups by figuring out how the words relate to each other. The puzzle resets every night at midnight and each new puzzle has a varying degree of difficulty. Just like Wordle, you can keep track of your winning streak and compare your scores with friends. Some days are trickier than others — just like other NYT Games favorites The Mini and Strands. If you're having a little trouble solving today's puzzle, check out our Connections tips and tricks guide for some good strategies or check out the hints for today's Connections puzzle below. And if you still can't get it, we'll tell you today's answers at the very end. How to play Connections Strands is a brand new daily puzzle from the New York Times. A trickier take on the classic word search, you'll need a keen eye to solve this puzzle. Like Wordle, Connections, and the Mini Crossword, Strands can be a bit difficult to solve some days. There's no shame in needing a little help from time to time. If you're stuck and need to know the answers to today's Strands puzzle, check out the solved puzzle below. How to play Strands You start every Strands puzzle with the goal of finding the "theme words" hidden in the grid of letters. Manipulate letters by dragging or tapping to craft words; double-tap the final letter to confirm. If you find the correct word, the letters will be highlighted blue and will no longer be selectable. Love crossword puzzles but don't have all day to sit and solve a full-sized puzzle in your daily newspaper? That's what The Mini is for! A bite-sized version of the New York Times' well-known crossword puzzle, The Mini is a quick and easy way to test your crossword skills daily in a lot less time (the average puzzle takes most players just over a minute to solve). While The Mini is smaller and simpler than a normal crossword, it isn't always easy. Tripping up on one clue can be the difference between a personal best completion time and an embarrassing solve attempt.

Title: This headstrap can add comfort and battery to your Meta Quest 3 this Black Friday

KIWI's leather cushioning will ease your headache woes When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The Meta Quest 3 and 3S are practical little devices for VR gaming, but their head straps are, not to be too mean, a little basic. Don't get me wrong, the clever tightening loops that slide along the back side are nice and easy to adjust, but if you were hoping for any cushioning at all, you may be left wanting. That's okay though because if you've been struggling to play for longer sessions with the Quest 3 or Quest 3S, there are third-party head straps that could absolutely change the game for you, as they did me. KIWI Design is my favorite, and in a special Black Friday treat, it's offering both its battery and comfort head straps for less. If you don't care too much about battery life, the Comfort Head Strap is going for just $19.99 at Amazon at the moment, which is the cheapest I've ever seen it drop to, and I track its price on a weekly basis. Black Friday Meta Quest deals like this can offer you the chance to boost the quality of life of your headset, even if the 3 and 3S devices aren't discounted in their own rights. If you've got a bit more money to play around with, you may be more interested in KIWI's battery-boosting option, which gives you the same plush comfort, but also gives your headset a longer lifespan. It's currently going for $39.79 at Amazon. KIWI Design Comfort Head Strap for Quest 3 / 3S | $39.99 $19.99 at AmazonSave $29 - Now, unfortunately, this is a Prime-exclusive deal, which means if you're not a paying member, you could take out a free trial and cancel before it takes any money away from you. Also, don't forget to tick the $10 coupon box on the retail page to get the full saving. Buy it if: ✅ You find the stock head strap uncomfortable✅ You like plush cushioning✅ You want something designed by a Meta partner Don't buy it if: ❌ You're hoping to use this with another VR headset❌ You want the Battery pack version UK: £25.49 at Amazon There's a lot to like about KIWI's Comfort head straps, and since testing one out with the Meta Quest 3, it's the only one I use. It should be noted that if you have the Meta Quest 3S, KIWI's straps will work with your device too. Thankfully, the designs of the two headsets are similar enough that they can make use of the same Meta Quest accessories. The comfort level of the KIWI Battery head strap really surprised me, because, for a cheaper add-on by a third-party brand, it feels extremely premium. It's got really plush cushioning that hugs your noggin while you play, and the leather material feels nice and genuine - I haven't noted any degradation or peeling that would point to a cheaper substitute being used. The battery version is particularly useful and has added many hours to my Blade & Sorcery survival mode runs. Whiling away the hours slaughtering NPCs has never been easier, and if anything, KIWI's head straps are responsible for the countless virtual lives I've taken in increasingly brutal ways. Luckily, it braces my head really gently thanks to its adjustable length, and I never feel that forehead ache like I sometimes can with the stock head strap. If there's one issue with this best Meta Quest accessory, it's maybe that it makes the headset feel as though it's sitting higher up on your head, and a little less secure when playing more active games. If you use the Quest 3 for a lot of fitness apps, maybe look for something more slimline, but I'm sure it wouldn't be a deal breaker and you could find the right fit for you and your use cases. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more Don't forget there are also Black Friday VR headset deals running, as well as Black Friday Xbox deals, and Black Friday gaming chair deals. One of my earliest memories is playing SuperMario64 and wondering why the controller I held had three grips, but I only had two hands. Ever since I've been in love with video games and their technology. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship at Expert Reviews. Over the last decade, I’ve been managing my own YouTube channel about my love of games too. These days, I'm one of the resident hardware nerds at GamesRadar+, and I take the lead on our coverage of gaming PCs, VR, controllers, gaming chairs, and content creation gear. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension. Location: UK Remote Holy Black Friday Batman - this Meta Quest 3 deal comes with a $75 online gift card PSVR 2 is cheaper than the Quest 3S right now, and I know which one I'd buy this Black Friday Creature Commandos star Frank Grillo thinks we’ll get a season 2 of the new DC show "unless something goes terribly awry" GamesRadar+ is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more Update: Cyber Monday may be over now, but many stores will slide into 'Cyber Week' to ride out the holiday deals event a little longer. We've been highlighting deals below since before Black Friday last week. Many will be expiring as we speak, but it's worth a quick look as some could continue on for a few more days. Original article follows: The S90D is our favorite 2024 TV overall. Its QD-OLED panel delivers a high-contrast image with vivid colors, wide viewing angles, and impressive brightness for this class. The U6N is one of the top budget TVs available. The 4K QLED display uses quantum dots, local dimming, and a Mini LED backlight to deliver higher contrast and a wider range of colors than most competitors in its class. The C4 is LG's latest midrange 4K OLED TV. It carries over everything we loved about last year's C3 while offering a slight increase in brightness and support for a faster 144Hz refresh rate with a PC. Samsung's Frame TV can be mounted flush against your wall like a hanging piece of art. It also features a matte screen to make it look more like canvas, and you can purchase optional magnetic frame bezels in different colors and designs. This 100-inch TV is a whopping size that will allow you to catch every inch of every game. With up to 800 nits of HDR brightness, local dimming, and a fast 144Hz refresh rate, this is one of the best values there is at this size. TCL's S5 LED display doesn't use quantum dots like the brand's pricier QLED TVs, but it's still capable of wide color support and it uses the Amazon Fire TV OS for easy integration with Alexa. The TCL QM7 is an impressive midrange QLED TV. Its Mini LED contrast performance, high brightness, and 144Hz gaming capabilities are nearly unrivaled at this price range. The B4 is LG's entry-level OLED TV. Though it can't get as bright as pricier models, it still offers an infinite contrast which makes it a great budget OLED for watching movies in a dark room. TCL's S5 is one of the brand's entry-level 4K TVs. Brightness and contrast are limited compared to pricier models, but the S5 still offers a wide range of colors and has Alexa built-in. This 720p TV comes with Alexa Voice Remote capabilities, so you can easily search across apps, switch inputs, and much more using your voice — no clunky remotes and tedious typing necessary. We only recommend it if you can find it on sale, though. Paramount Plus offers a huge library of on-demand content from Paramount, CBS, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, and MTV. The Premium Plan also includes Showtime and live CBS streaming. It costs $12.99 a month or $120 a year. For the next two months, though, you get this tier for just $2.99 a month, which is a great opportunity to make your way through a few shows with no irritating ads - of which there are many on the ad-supported tier. Paramount Plus is perfect for viewers who want to stream CBS TV shows, local NFL games, and tons of content from Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, and MTV. And if you get the premium tier you can also unlock ad-free streaming and access to Showtime. A new promotion sees the monthly fee knocked down to $2.99 for a couple of months. There's a huge double-saving on these two bundled popular ad-supported streaming platforms as this price lasts for 12 months. If you subscribe to these two individually, they're $9.99 a month each. Outside of Cyber Monday, this already-discounted Duo package would be $10.99, but less than a cup of coffee a month for the next year is unbeatable value. Offer expires December 2. Hulu is an excellent choice for cord-cutters thanks to a mix of exclusive titles and next-day streaming for popular network shows. The ad-supported tier is usually $9.99 a month, but the epic Cyber Monday deal has returned, lowering those monthly fee prices to just 99 cents for a year. We'd spend an extra couple of bucks and get it bundled with Disney Plus, though. Both offers expire December 2. Peacock is a convenient streaming source for hit NBC TV shows, Universal movies, and select sports like Sunday Night Football. The service also carries its own slate of original programming. The annual version of Peacock's ad-supported tier is an absolute steal right now, with a major Cyber Monday discount getting you a whole year of access for just $19.99. That's plenty of time to enjoy a rich collection of sitcoms, movies, and live events. Offer expires December 2. The Starz streaming service offers several original shows and classic movies. The semi-annual plan is a steal compared to a standard month-to-month subscription. Fubo is the streaming service for sports fans. Its huge library of channels includes regional and international sports leagues, setting it apart from the competition. You can also tack on additional programming to your plan, but it'll cost you extra. The Leesa Sapira Hybrid Mattress provides great edge support and motion isolation. Its mix of memory foam and pocket springs produces an average firmness, making it an outstanding solution for back pain sufferers of any sleeping style. Save an extra $25 with our exclusive promo code INSIDER25. The Saatva Classic Mattress is designed to suit a variety of sleeping styles and features a plush top for luxurious comfort. The DreamCloud Premier Hybrid Mattress performed well in all of our tests, which makes it ideal for most sleeping types, couples, and people who tend to overheat at night. Casper has redesigned its classic hybrid mattress into the Dream, which offers a medium-firm feel that sleeps cool and has zone support. While we haven't tested it yet, the Nectar Premier is designed to be a step up in comfort from the Classic, which we love. At under $1,000, it's the brand's most popular model. The gel memory foam of the Nectar makes it a versatile mattress that conforms to the contours of your body to relieve pressure. It's a premium sleep experience, but its price tag is way under a grand. The memory foam of the Bear mattress, combined with Celliant technology, makes this a great bed for active folks looking for some rest and recovery. Apply code BFCM4TY to save 40% off at checkout, and get free pillows, instead of the automatically applied deal. The Big Fig Mattress is constructed for heavier individuals with firm support and a high weight capacity. The Tempur-Pedic Cloud Mattress features contouring foam that cradles sleepers of all body types and sleeping styles while offering outstanding pressure relief and heat dissipation. The Scuba is a crowd-favorite style from lululemon, and this version has a roomy, oversized fit alongside the style's signature fleecy fabric. This simple knit is made with a blend of recycled and virgin cashmere. It comes in five colorways. "Jenni Kayne's cashmere sweaters are a splurge for sure, but this one is the best luxury-grade cardigan I've tried," writes associate style editor Gabrielle Chase. “Upon feeling the soft material, I knew that the piece was quality and would hold up after more than just a few wears and washes,” says freelance reporter Olivia Rose Rushing. “I was surprised at just how comfy it was — especially since I was able to adjust the shoulder straps to my liking.” This pushup bra uses a super-soft sheen microfiber fabric with extra-compressive side wings for a smoothing effect. It’s designed to be invisible under clothing. Featuring a sumptuous sherpa collar, an asymmetrical closure, and a soft leather construction, this trend-forward jacket will keep you warm all season long, sans sacrificing style. With 700-fill power, responsibly-sourced goose down, a water-repellent and wind-resistant fabric, and a removable hood, this cropped puffer will keep you warm all through winter. It comes in 11 colors. “I’ve been buying Abercrombie & Fitch winter coats for years, and I’ve never been disappointed in a purchase," says freelance writer Talia Ergas. "The Ultra Puffer turned out to be everything I hoped for. The puffiness is balanced nicely by the short silhouette and luxurious faux fur accents. I also love that the bottom hem is elastic, so it hugs my hips and keeps the cold out.” This soft, smooth raschel fleece jacket is lightweight and insulating. Plus, it's made from 100% recycled materials. There’s no time like the present to layer up in a seriously cozy flannel shirt jacket. Complete with a quilted lining, it’s a perfectly rugged layer atop a thermal shirt on brisk winter mornings. Turn back the clock with this throwback rugby shirt, a Ralph Lauren staple for decades that looks as great now as it did back in the day. This cozy knit is a versatile layering piece thanks to its breathable cotton construction. While it’s a men’s sweater, many of our female editors found the sizing to be perfectly oversized for all shapes, sizes, and genders. This jacket feels like a plush fleece but is still thin enough for winter layering. It comes in several different color options, from navy to green or brown. This effortlessly cool mini skirt stands out for its functional cargo pockets and stretchy cotton moleskin fabric—and it looks equally great paired with a graphic tee or sweater as it does with a blouse and tights. These size-inclusive jeans are available in petite and tall lengths and have an extra two inches in the hips to create an easy-going, flattering fit. While some styles of Bonobos’ classic chinos aren’t on sale, these refined brushed twill chinos in a range of seasonal colors are up for grabs. They also come with Bonobos’ eye-catching lined pockets for a colorful touch of flair. Wear these medium-compression shorts under your ensemble for a smoothing effect. Designed with an ultra-thin, breathable fabric that is moisture-wicking and quick-drying and a no-squeeze silicone waistband that prevents rolling, this shapewear is as comfy as it is flattering. These best-selling booties have a chic baby heel and an elongated toe, with a padded interior for an easier break-in period. These sophisticated leather boots are well-suited for nearly any occasion, be it a trip to the office or a night out with friends. The 2.5-inch stacked heel adds a nice boost in height—that is, without needing to sacrifice on comfort. L.L.Bean's shearling-lined 10-inch boots are the warmest of the bunch, but any of the Bean Boots will serve you well through both fall and winter, and they go with most outfits. The boot that made L.L.Bean a household name. These boots are designed to keep feet dry, warm, and comfortable in rain, mud, and other wet conditions. As the second iteration of the Tree Dasher running sneaker, this version is even more comfortable and equipped for performance. Allbirds Women's Tree Runner sneakers are crazy comfortable with a flattering and close-fitting silhouette and have a smooth but texturized upper. It’s hard to think of a more legendary sneaker than Air Jordans. The Mid version, originally released in 2001, offers the classic look, cushioning, and stability of the OG High Top while being less restrictive and even more affordable (all colorways are on sale). They may be small, but these chunky double hoops add big style to any outfit. Choose from four color and metal combinations: double gold, double silver, gold/marble blue, gold/silver. With seven princess-cut diamonds set on a white gold band, this ring is perfect for a wedding band or special occasion. The coziest version of the cult-favorite belt bag, this fleecy material adds a comfy, lived-in feel to any winter outfit. The Mini Bow Bag is one of our favorite all-occasion bags for its versatility. It's equally at home at a formal event or a day on the town, and you can carry it as a top-handle bag, over-the-shoulder, or cross-body. This sleek leather wallet is ideal for those with dexterity issues as it can be opened with one hand, and it snaps shut with a satisfying magnetic seal. The 2022 MacBook Air introduced Apple's M2 processor, which improved performance over the M1 version. It has an especially thin and lightweight design, an improved webcam, and a larger display. Make sure to check for the 16GB RAM model, as it's becoming the standard base option instead of the original 8GB RAM model. The Series 10 is thinner than its predecessors, with a larger case and screen overall. It runs on the S10 processor; it has a wide-angle OLED display for easier reading at an angle, faster charging, and media playback from its speakers. The second-generation Apple Watch SE is an impressive entry-level wearable that shares the same processor as the Series 8 and Ultra, so it's still smooth despite being two years old. It doesn’t have the advanced health sensors of premium models, but it offers enough features to satisfy most people. Verizon is offering the iPhone 16 for free as long as the line using the phone is on the Unlimited Ultimate plan and the user doesn't switch phones for 36 months. Verizon is offering the iPhone 16 Pro Max without a trade-in for $5/month for 36 months (three years), which amounts to $180. The deal requires the Unlimited Ultimate plan for the line that's using the iPhone 16 Pro Max. If you switch phones before the 36 months period, you'll have to pay off the remaining balance of phone. New and existing Verizon customers can trade-in any phone in any condition from Apple, Google, or Samsung to get the iPhone 16 Pro free. You must keep the iPhone 16 Pro for 36 months (three years) to keep the deal active, and can't upgrade to a new phone. The line that's using this deal must have or upgrade to Verizon's Unlimited Ultimate plan. You also need service plans for the free iPad and Apple Watch. There may be a one-time $35 activation fee. It's possible to get an iPhone 16 Pro Max with this deal, but it would cost $5/month for 36 months. The Galaxy S24 Ultra is Samsung's top-end phone in 2024, set apart from its Galaxy S24 siblings and most of the premium phone competition with its four cameras, giant 6.8-inch display, stunning battery life, and included S Pen stylus. The Pixel 9 Pro XL offers a large 6.8-inch display and one of the best battery test results we've seen in a phone. The Pixel 9 Pro shares the same performance, first-rate three-lens camera system, super-bright Actua display, and Gemini AI suite with a free year of Gemini Advanced. Mint's Unlimited plan offers unlimited talk, text, and data, but you'll be slowed to 4G LTE speeds after using 40GB. New customers can get half off their first three months when they pay up front. We recommend signing up for the Unlimited option to score the most savings since it's typically the priciest of the lineup. When you buy an eligible phone through Mint Mobile, you can bundle it with a year of an unlimited data plan at a 50% discounted rate of just $15/month. The MVNO is also heavily discounting several phones from their standard starting prices, including up to $500 off the Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Dell's line of premium XPS laptops are known for their performance and reliability. The 9530 series features Intel's Core i7-13620H processor and starts with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. That should be plenty of performance and storage for most people with busy, fast-paced workloads. This Dell Inspiron's display folds 180-degrees to turn the laptop into a tablet. Running on the AMD Ryzen 5 8640HS processor, 8GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage, it can handle most people's workloads with ease. The base model IdeaPad 1 comes with a large 15-inch screen and runs on the entry-level AMD Ryzen 3 7320U processor with 4GB RAM and 128GB of storage. It's purely for very basic uses, like lightweight web browsing, but it's priced well for its purpose.

This new VPN deal drops the per-month price as low as $2.99 on a two-year plan.

In our tests, soft-side bags surprisingly tend to be more durable than hard-sided bags and offer a bit more flexibility in packing space.

The Coop Sleep Goods Original Pillow offers thoughtful features like adjustable fill, a washable pillow cover, and an unparalleled 100-night trial, making it the best choice for most people.

The Quest 3S is Meta's most affordable VR headset. It has the same chipset and gaming performance as the pricier Quest 3, but its display isn't as sharp. This is an excellent fit for casual users who want a more budget-friendly entry into the world of VR. This is a great time to buy, as you'll get a free download of the Batman: Arkham Shadow game (worth $50) and three months of Meta Quest+ (worth $24).

It also features a 1ms response time, a 1500R curvature, AMD FreeSynce Premium, two DisplayPorts, and two HDMI ports. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X shares many features with the more expensive Nova Pro, like a noise-canceling microphone and wireless cross-platform support, while maintaining a midrange price. This Corsair drive is a great all-around PS5 SSD with a selection of sizes from 1GB up to 8TB. The built-in heatsink saves you a few dollars over buying one yourself and makes for a slightly easier installation process. 1TB/2TB is plenty for most gamers and is where the best value lies as the price jump on larger capcities is wildly disproportionate on a dollar per GB ratio. The J9+ is a powerful robot vacuum that deftly navigates around household obstacles, leaves hardwood floors spotless, and tackles low-pile carpets with ease. Although we haven't tried this exact model, we've tested a similar Shark 2-1 robot vacuum with Matrix technology and had great results. It has both standard suction and mopping abilities, hence the 2-1 in the name. We tested the Shark PowerDetect in a different color and found it was the best robot vacuum for pet hear, thanks to its roomy, self-empty charging dock and powerful suction when it detects heavy debris. The Ecovacs DEEBOT X2 OMNI Robot Vacuum & Mop is a wet-dry vacuum robot that maps your house quickly and has a station with a hands-off self-cleaning system. The V15 Detect Absolute Cordless Stick Vacuum is one of Dyson's most powerful models. It features HEPA filtration and laser illumination to reveal hidden debris. This model usually runs north of $700, but it's 40% off right now. We've never seen it priced this low. The Dyson V11 Extra cordless vacuum cleaner is engineered with the power, versatility and run time for a whole-home deep clean. This cordless vacuum can help suck up pesky pet hair from anywhere in the house. At 4.5 quarts, this stand mixer is a bit smaller than we usually recommend for folks who want a full-size mixer, but this is a stellar deal if you don't mind the more petite capacity. The OXO Brew Conical Burr Grinder grinds slowly, but that in turn reduces static, noise, and inconsistencies in your grounds. Make cooking easier with the Ninja Air Fryer XL (AF150AMZ) and its five different cooking settings. From baking to dehydrating, this air fryer can be the new secret touch behind your recipes. This massive 14-qt. air fryer is just $50, and is equipped to handle large family-sized meals with two racks to cook double the food. It also uniquely has a built-in rotating rotisserie rack to make your own chicken roast. Coffee is a serious necessity for some, and the AeroPress is small, simple, portable, and easy-to-use way to brew a highly competitive, frothy cup of coffee somewhere between a French press and an espresso. This self-cleaning, programmable coffee maker allows you to choose your brew strength, so you always get the perfect cup of coffee. This white nonstick cookware set can help enhance any kitchen. It includes frying pans, a stock pot, saucepans with lids, and more.

It may be pricey, but if you're looking for a high-tech hair dryer that actually lives up to the hype, the Dyson Super Sonic may be for you. The Dyson Airwrap is a little too much blow-dryer-brush for most people, but there are few systems that give you such versatility. This multi-styler comes with six different options for brush heads, complete with a styling comb, filter cleaning brush, travel bag, and storage case. Rihanna created this fragrance specifically for her own body and decided to share it with the world.

It’s an incredible value and includes three gorgeous color stories ideal for holiday parties and beyond. The most recently confirmed shade of Taylor Swift's iconic red lipstick, this warm brown-ish red was worn by Taylor to a 2024 Chiefs game. This cult-favorite concealer offers lightweight coverage that sinks seamlessly into the skin. This one-of-a-kind moisturizer is part skincare, part makeup. It's packed with nourishing oils like grapeseed. But instead of absorbing into your skin, the moisturizing ingredients sit on the surface and create a dewy glow that's also hydrating your skin. The Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence uses snail mucin to repair and fortify your complexion. Apple's latest generation of AirPods features a new design to optimize comfort for wearers of every kind. It's powered by the H2 chip and uses a smaller case than ever. Apple's base AirPods are now available with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) without the use of in-ear tips. The new model uses the brand's H2 chip to power features like Transparency Mode, Adaptive Audio, and Conversation Awareness. Sony’s WF-1000XM5 earbuds deliver excellent sound quality and noise canceling in a sleek, comfy design that’s tough to beat. Apple's update to the AirPods Max finally moves the headphones to USB-C charging and five new colors. Otherwise, the hardware and audio performance are largely the same. The Sonos Ace are the comfiest headphones we've reviewed. They also offer great noise-canceling and audio quality that rival top models from the competition. Anker’s Soundcore Life Q30 headphones offer noise-canceling performance that’s much better than it should be for the money, alongside solid sound quality and massive battery life. Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra once more put the brand on top, with best-in-class noise canceling wrapped in a sleek and comfy design. The Beats Studio Pro x Kim Kardashian are the same as the standard Studio Pro wireless headphones, but with a color curated by Kim Kardashian. They are designed to do it all, whether you want to be fully immersed in an album or take a call on the go. They offer both active noise canceling (ANC) and transparency modes, making them a versatile option for any situation. We've spotlighted The Ultra Puffer in our round up of the best Abercrombie Cyber Monday deals because it's a lookalike to Aritzia's SuperPuff and only costs $120 (plus, you can get it for an extra 15% off with the code CYBERAF). "It's a bit puffy, but that's balanced nicely by the short silhouette and faux fur accents," writes freelance author Talia Ergas. "The hood is detachable, which gives me two looks in one. I also love that the bottom hem is elastic, so it hugs my hips and keeps the cold out." Find more outerwear at a discount in our guide to the best Cyber Monday deals on women's winter coats. Two years ago, when I was busy hunting down an Xbox Series X, I wished someone from the future told me I wouldn't need one to play Xbox games. Much of my gaming isn't even through the pricey console but my Game Pass subscription. If I had resisted FOMO and waited, I could have saved hundreds by getting the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max instead, bundled with a wireless controller and one month of Game Pass Ultimate. Game Pass is the Xbox's cloud-based game streaming service, and the Ultimate package lets you access all available games on any supported device, including the latest Amazon Fire TV Stick. You're ready to play once you have the Xbox app downloaded and the controller connected. The Fire TV Stick is also a good option for when you're traveling and away from your Xbox console. With Game Pass, you can pick up a game where you left off. No, you won't get the full experience as you would on a Series X or Series S machine. But as long as you have a good connection, the visuals look great, and the gameplay feels similar to playing on the console. Les Shu I can't shower in silence. I need music, a podcast, or something to listen to. Enter the JBL Go 3 Bluetooth Speaker, currently just $30 for Cyber Monday. I like that it's waterproof, durable, gets plenty loud, and has decent sound quality, even when I crank it as I sing along to Kate Bush. Full disclosure: I've purchased two of these speakers. The first one lasted over two years before it stopped charging (it recharged using a USB-C connection). You see, I kept the speaker in the shower with me. So, every day, it would get completely drenched. That kind of treatment will cause any electronics to malfunction. So, I bought a replacement and kept it outside the shower, within reach, and it's worked like a charm. I have little patience for malfunctioning electronics and haven't had any troubles with the JBL Go 3. I especially like how easily it pairs with my phone via Bluetooth and stays connected for quite a distance when I wander off. At $30, this matches the lowest price ever for the JBL Go 3. I strongly recommend it for you or as an affordable gift for the shower singer in your life. Abercrombie has come a long way as a brand, especially when it comes to sizing. Gone are the days of disappointment from a roster of impossibly tiny sizes — we've since welcomed an era of unexpected but much-appreciated inclusivity. Our style team has been testing jeans for years, and Abercrombie's denim is some of the best for the price. You can read our review of Abercrombie jeans or check out the current Cyber Monday sale, which includes an automatic 25% off nearly every pair and an extra 15% off once you add them to your cart. Most of the brand's jeans come in sizes 23 up to 37, and many also come in several length options, including extra short, short, regular, long, and extra long. I'm just over 5 feet tall and I mostly wear the extra short or short sizes. I love that they don't just offer a single petite or tall length and call it a day — you can really get the size that's best for you. This discount is the best any of us have seen this year so far and we doubt it will happen again for a while, so you might want to get a move on tonight! Sally Kaplan If you have oily lids like me, you know how tough it is to keep your eyeshadow looking good throughout the day. With my almond-shaped eyes, I also experience a lot of trouble keeping eyeliner crisp in my outer corners, as most formulas rub away after a few hours. That's why I love Urban Decay's Eyeshadow Primer Potion — and right now, it's only $14, so I had to stock back up. The formula itself is sheer, but a little goes a long way. A thin coat keeps my eye makeup lasting all day, even in finicky places like my creases or outer corners. I've been a fan for years, and every year, I wait for this product to go on sale during Black Friday or Cyber Monday to restock. This year, I lucked out, and it was only half-price, making it super easy to add to the cart. We cover a lot of makeup here at Insider Reviews. Check out our beauty coverage to learn more about the best products for you, from waterproof mascaras to opaque concealers. Sarah Saril I'm not much of a beauty guru, but I love perfume. My prized Bond NYC bottle is running low, so I'm on the hunt for a new signature scent. When the Skylar Beauty Trial Set came up during Cyber Week, I jumped at the chance to try it out. Skylar is a clean beauty brand and its perfumes are hypoallergenic, vegan, and cruelty-free. The samples in the sale pack include Peach Fields, Vanilla Sky, Lime Sands, Salt Air, and Coconut Cove. I like that the collection is made of simple individual scents that can be paired for more complexity. This winter, I'm looking forward to experimenting with layering Vanilla Sky and Salt Air. Skylar rarely goes on sale, and even in the last few days, we've seen two different sale prices. Right now, you can get the trial set for $12.50, which is the best price we've seen all year. Lily Alig I've tested dozens of robots for our best robot vacuum guide, and one of my all-time favorite vacs is the Bissell SpinWave. It was one of the top picks in our guide for a while, but it's gone in and out of stock over the years, and the price fluctuates dramatically. I'd look elsewhere at its usual $400 price, but at its Cyber Monday special of $145, I strongly recommend it. What sets the Bissell SpinWave apart is its mopping performance. It features spinning mopheads that scrub the floor rather than just move the mess around. The vacuuming performance was also impressive, cleaning up most of the flour, kitty litter, coffee grounds, and pet hair I set out for testing. I especially recommend the Bissell SpinWave to pet lovers. It's great for cleaning up after pets, but it lacks obstacle avoidance in today's high-end robot vacuums. Still, you won't find a better option for automating your floor cleaning at this price point. James Brains Among the best Cyber Monday Apple deals, the Beats Studio Buds are an exceptional budget-to-mid-range wireless earbud option. The Amazon deal for 47% off matches the model's record-low price. I've had the same pair of Beats Studio Buds since 2021. They're a resilient product that has survived myriad forms of water and drop damage while retaining the same reliable, bass-heavy sound. I should note that the Studio Buds are far from the best noise-canceling headphones. I've since upgraded to our guide's top pick for in-ear noise-cancellation, the Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra Earbuds (which might also be worth your while at 23% off), to more adequately drown out the din of New York City's streets. However, I've kept the Studio Buds as a trusted backup pair and have come to appreciate their seamless pairing with Apple products relative to the Bose pair's occasionally finicky integration. In certain instances, I prefer the Beats' compact size and fit, even if it sacrifices sound quality compared to the high-end pair. For $80, though, you're sure to get your money's worth. John Lynch Winter is in full swing in Michigan, with wind chills remaining stubbornly in the teens. Yet, I'm just as stubborn when it comes to turning up the thermostat. Why should I crank the heat when I can keep it at a reasonable 64 degrees and just use a space heater if I get cold? This is where the Lasko MyHeat Personal Mini Space Heater comes in. Typically an already-affordable $25, the Lasko MyHeat is marked down to $17 for Cyber Monday. With a flip of the switch, I have instant warm air keeping me comfy at my desk. It occupies minimal space in my cluttered work area and operates quietly, so I can keep it running during meetings. I tested it for our best space heater guide, and it only increased the temperature in my 100-square-foot office by 2.5 degrees. However, it's not meant to heat whole rooms; instead, it offers a personal blast of hot air. If you want extra warmth without the added utility costs of heating your whole living area, I recommend spending the $17 on the Lasko MyHeat space heater deal. James Brains Bombas' massive Cyber Monday sale means everything's 25% off with code "BIGHOLIDAY25." You can feel good about stocking up because Bombas donates one pair of socks to charity for each one purchased, so by shopping tonight, you'll be ahead on your good deed for Giving Tuesday. The latest Bombas style I'm into is the cozy faux sherpa Sunday Slippers. I slide into them first thing in the morning, and they stay on as I get ready for the day, thanks to a raised rear around the heel cup. Their midsoles are made of a plush layer of memory foam laid over an EVA footbed, so the foam won't collapse the more you wear them. Learn why its socks are worth the try in our full Bombas socks review, and check out our guide to the best Bombas Cyber Monday deals. Gabrielle Chase The 2024 MacBook Pro running on the M4 Pro processor comes with 24GB RAM — 6GB more than the 2023 version. Today, the 2024 Pro is $250 off. It's an ideal machine for those who need untamed power in a portable package. The 2023 version is also on sale this Cyber Monday, but it's only $50 less with its deal, so I'd recommend going for the 2024 model. If you're looking for a powerhouse with a more modest price, the 2022 MacBook Air running on the M2 processor with 16GB of RAM is a rare bargain at $800, which is $200 off Apple's full price. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's an "older" model — Apple's M processors have incredible longevity and performance. The newer MacBook Air that runs on the M3 processor is $100 more with its deal, but we don't think the returns are significant enough for the extra money, at least not for those looking for the best value. The latest 15-inch MacBook Air M3 with 16GB RAM for $200 off makes a very tempting case. Its 15-inch display is a tangible upgrade, and the previous generation model is a bad deal with its 8GB of RAM, even if it's $300 off — you should get the latest M3 15-inch model for the newer processor and twice the RAM. Antonio Villas-Boas I wish I had waited until Cyber Monday to purchase the Monos Check-In Large suitcase. You could snag this hard-case check-in bag from one of the best luggage brands for as little as $251, regularly $355. This is the largest version of its standard check-in bag. The deeper savings are only available for select colorways. Monos' durable suitcases have a sleek look similar to Away, another popular luggage maker. I found the spinner wheels, zipper, and handle to perform well. Indeed, when my colleagues tested Monos' carry-on bags, they found them to be some of the best options at their price. That means a Monos sale is worth every penny. The best thing about Monos is that they offer a 100-day trial and free shipping. Provided there isn't damage or usage, you can return a product if it isn't to your liking. Besides Cyber Monday deals, Monos has discounts of up to 40% on select luggage and travel gear sitewide when you use the code CYBERWEEK. Les Shu If you're looking to elevate your camping experience, Solo Stove is offering 50% off its Campfire Gear Kit. The set normally sells for $200 but is down to $100, thanks to being one of many Solo Stove products discounted throughout its site. The Campfire stove works similarly to two of our top-tested recommendations in our best fire pit buying guide: the Solo Stove Bonfire and Solo Stove Mesa. This kit includes the basics: the Campfire camping stove, two pots, a tripod to hang a pot, and a carrying case. As someone who plans to camp more often, I decided the Campfire Gear Kit is a great way to get into cooking outdoors. The stove and pots are lightweight and easy to pack, so I wouldn't need to bring heavier camping cookware or propane gas tanks. While waiting for the fire to burn out, it can double as a small fire pit for making s'mores after dinner. The Bonfire and Mesa fire pits are also on sale, as are other fire pits, pizza ovens, camping stoves, and more outdoor products. It's Solo Stove's biggest sale of the year, so it's a good time to check out its camping and backyard gear. Les Shu As an only-on-New-Years-and-at-weddings drinker, I love when our team covers non-alcoholic spirits and beverages. Our resident whiskey expert, James Brains, has literally traveled up and down the Kentucky bourbon trail developing his palette. Monday is one of his favorite brands for non-alcoholic spirits. During Cyber Week, Monday is offering 30% off everything. The typical $45 price tag is worth it, but $15 off makes it even more compelling. Though we haven't tried the zero-alcohol gin or mezcal yet, we have high hopes based on our experience with the whiskey. James Brains called it "evocative of tootsie rolls" with a pleasant finish. In his blind taste test, the Monday Old Fashioned was the best and closest to the real thing. All the Monday bottles are gorgeous and great as holiday gifts. Shop the bundles or single bottles while the sale lasts. Lily Alig Since my wife's Apple Watch Series 5 started running out of battery before bed, I originally planned on swapping the battery out. I realized that the Apple Watch Series 10 came with so many upgrades that it felt worth buying that instead, especially with the $70 off Cyber Monday discount. My review of the Series 10 is coming, but I already know I love it: the new slim and lightweight design, the latest Vitals feature support in watchOS 11, major performance upgrade, Crash Detection, and fast-charge ability are hits for me and will be for my wife. Plus, she'll finally be able to track her sleep — something she couldn't manage with her old Apple Watch's battery without topping it off just before bed. On a $400 product, $70 might not seem like much of a discount, but it's pretty good for an Apple device that was just released in September. It's the best Apple Watch for most people, and it's going to make a neat, unplanned Christmas present. Antonio Villas-Boas When I research which stylish clothing our readers are most interested in, I also test to make sure they're actually comfortable. The Quince Ultra Stretch Ponte Wide Leg Pants are some of my favorite stretchy work pants I've found — they're from a lightweight Ponte fabric that makes me feel like I'm wearing leggings at work, and only to the untrained eye do they not look like slacks. They come in two inseams and six colors (which may be worth stocking up on while they're on sale for $15 off at $34.90). This pair runs short, so get the 32-inch if you're between lengths. You'll want to be sure of the fit, because the main caveat with the best Quince Cyber Monday deals is that they're non-returnable.

I've tested over 100 mattresses for our best mattress guide, and there's one that blew me away — and I wish I could sleep on it every night — is the Tempur-Pedic Cloud. Right now, it's marked down to $1,399 for a queen, plus you get two free pillows. The all-foam Cloud is Tempur-Pedic's most affordable mattress, which means it's the least you'll pay to sleep on the company's amazing signature foam. I love the Tempur material because it contours to the curves of my body to keep my spine perfectly aligned while relieving pressure points. While testing the Cloud, I fell asleep within minutes each night. This is the mattress I'd buy if I weren't testing new ones every few weeks. The Tempur-Cloud is marked 30% off a few times throughout the year, but I've never seen it marked lower, so if you're looking to upgrade your sleep experience, I'd act on this deal now. With its risk-free home trial, you can return it within 90 days if you don't like it. Check out my full Tempur-Pedic Cloud Mattress review. James Brains. I scan thousands of deals over the course of the five-day shopping event we in product journalism (sort of) affectionately call "the Turkey Five" and while I see lots of great deals, there's rarely one that stops me in my tracks so abruptly that I have to share it with all my friends. For me, this year, that was Cuyana's sale — specifically its 20% discount on the never discounted System Tote. We named the System Tote the best tote bag we tested because it's chic, durable, and has a clever organization system (hence the name) that we haven't seen in other bags. Instead of a standard array of pockets and accessories, you customize the tote with ad-ons that suit your needs and each component snaps in and out. Not carrying a laptop today? Snap the optional laptop case out and gain back the interior space. One thing that really attracted me to the bag was that it's the nicest-looking tote I've seen that has an optional crossbody strap. Business Insider Reviews' executive editor Sally Kaplan has had a System Tote for about 4 years now, and it's her go-to bag for vacations, flights, weekend trips, and long car rides. "It fits an unbelievable amount of stuff, but it also doesn't look floppy or silly if I just put a few things in it," she says. "On a usual vacation, this bag will hold two pairs of shoes, my giant Dyson blow dryer, a hair brush, my toiletry and makeup bags, a scarf or sweater, and a couple of snacks." The downside is the System Tote is an investment at its normal price, especially if you want a lot of add-on components. I was holding out hope for a sale, but I was shocked to see Cuyana offer a discount this good. Past sales from the brand usually hover around 15% off, if they have a sale at all. I'm not the only one who thinks it's a great deal: there's only one sale color of the 13-inch tote and two colors of the 16-inch tote left in stock (fortunately, they're great colors). Cuyana's whole sale is worth taking a look at, especially since it likely won't come around for another year. We rounded up our picks for the best Cyber Monday Cuyana deals, so you have the absolute highlights. For more about what we love in this brand, check out our Cuyana review. Lauren Savoie. As Business Insider's air fryer expert, I've tested over 60 models for our best air fryer guide. There's one that I consistently recommend when people are considering buying this relatively new appliance: the Beautiful Touchscreen Air Fryer. Right now, it's marked down to an all-time low $59 at Walmart. Beautiful is Drew Barrymore's brand, sold exclusively at Walmart. I love it because it cooks evenly and quickly at a budget price. Though only two colors are on sale, white and Starry Night Blue, you can pick from ten colors, so there's sure to be one that matches your kitchen's decor. The six-quart basket of the Beautiful air fryer holds a lot of food for an air fryer at this price point. I cooked a pound of chicken wings to crispy perfection in 16 minutes. Frozen fries were restaurant-quality in 13. Plus, clean-up was a breeze. You can quickly wipe off the grime from the nonstick interior or pop it in the dishwasher. If you've been on the fence about air-frying, I strongly recommend you take advantage of this deal. With Walmart's 90-day return policy, what have you got to lose? James Brains. That's not a typo, nor is it an introductory offer for a month or two. This bundle gets you Disney+ and Hulu for $2.99 a month for an entire year. It's a genuine mic-dropper of a deal for two excellent streaming services. The caveat, of course, being that this is for the ad-supported tiers of both services. Individually, they're $9.99 a month, but the year-round Duo Bundle merges them into a $10.99 a month offer, so going down to $2.99 is a big deal for sure. You'll need to be a new customer to get this excellent rate, and you're not obliged to keep it for a year as it's a rolling one-month contract. If you let it keep rolling, the price will go up to $10.99 next December (or higher if prices go up by then). My advice: cancel a month early next year, and you'll be eligible for next year's Black Friday promo deal again. Brendan Griffiths. Like Black Friday before it, Cyber Monday sales have been disappointing for anyone looking to pick up an Xbox Series X. Unlike the PS5, Microsoft hasn't bothered with a Slim version and is generally still charging the same price it did for the console at launch over four years ago. However, it has just launched an all-digital Series X in white. And it's $100 cheaper than the disc-based console, thanks to a Cyber Monday deal knocking $50 off. So you can get the white Series X, with no disc drive for $398 at Walmart. That's still a lot of money, given the digital PS5 Slim is only $374 today. That said, if you are happy to forgo physical media, this might be tempting. The excellent Xbox Game Pass is a great subscription to fully embrace all-digital on Microsoft's console as it's absolutely packed with great new games. Brendan Griffiths. While some end dates for Cyber Monday deals are up in the air, Max has confirmed on its site that this massive deal will expire today. It could be midnight PT or maybe even ET, but it's into the final hours for sure. The 70% discount applies to the ad-supported tier, but for the next six months, you'll pay just $2.99 a month for Max, down from the usual $9.99. Given the quality of the shows on offer, this is one of the best Cyber Monday streaming deals we've ever seen. You can cancel before the six months are up if you wish. The offer is only open to new and returning subscribers. Brendan Griffiths. Looking for a pillow upgrade? The Coop's Original Adjustable Pillow is 25% off, the lowest price we've ever seen it go for. Usually $75, it automatically discounts to $56.25 at the checkout at Coop's site. This is the same pillow we put right at the top of our best pillows buying guide. The memory foam inside is shredded and you're encouraged to remove or add more (extra is supplied) to get just the right level of support required, so it's a great match for all sleeper styles. I've just ordered one myself after hearing multiple colleagues rate it so highly (and a bunch of other sites' pillow guides), even if part of me dies inside for spending $56 on a pillow. But seeing as the $20 memory foam one I bought at Amazon in July already feels increasingly flat, it's time to try a proper upgrade. Coop has a wider sale for other pillows and bedding with up to 50% off. You won't see the reduced prices on the item's listing page, just the percentage that's coming off at checkout, which is an odd way of trying to convert a sale, but there we go. Brendan Griffiths. I'd spent a lot of time before Cyber Monday weighing up a new TV. Having just moved to the US, I'm rebooting my entire setup which means picking up a TV and game consoles all over again. Having left an LG C2 behind in the UK, I was weighing up an OLED like the LG C4, Samsung 90D, or maybe even save a few bucks via the LG B4 line. But then I started reading the reviews of the Hisense 7N range and fell down the comparison video rabbit hole reading up on how its Mini-LED 144hz display with Dolby Vision is competitive with TVs more than twice its price. TLDR reader, I bought the 55-inch model for $479 at Best Buy - about half of what I'd budgeted for one of the others mentioned above. It's sat next to me right now, still boxed and unwatched, because I'm here, talking to you. Anyway, if you're tempted, check out; you can see this TV with hundreds smashed off the price of the 55-inch, 65-inch, and 75-inch models at Best Buy. Amazon's deals are $3 cheaper right now, but there's a long wait for delivery on all of them. Want more options? Check out Steven's full list of the best Cyber Monday TV deals. Brendan Griffiths. The regular deal price we see during flagship sale days has finally been beaten. That's quite surprising as the usual discounts from $250 down to $170-$160 already seemed generous enough, especially for an Apple product. Well, we have an all-time low price today: the 2nd Gen AirPods Pro are $154 at Amazon. Despite not having a proper upgrade in a few years, these remain some of the best earbuds on the market, with quality audio and excellent noise-canceling. This is for the newer USB-C model. If you have the original AirPods Pro 2, we wouldn't bother with these, as you're only getting a different charging port and some modest dust resistance. The sound quality and fit remain the same. Brendan Griffiths. Yes, the digital and disc-drive models of the PS5 Slim are still in stock at Amazon. The original non-slim PS5 is no longer in production, so this is the one you want. PS5 stock has been in and out all weekend, but the same record-low prices have been available on the console alone and in a new bundle with free Fortnite DLC. Even if you don't want the Fortnite content, snap that one up anyway, as it's not costing you anything extra. The digital model is down to $374 (down from $450), and the disc-drive version is $75 off at a reduced price of $424. Brendan Griffiths. Jump to

Title: I recommend Meta Ray-Bans over AirPods Pro as the best tech deal of Black Friday 2024

Among the most popular tech products of 2024, the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses have been the surprise hit. Amazon is offering the version with the classic black frames for $239 (20% off the $299 retail price). This is an especially excellent deal when you consider that many styles of the Meta Ray-Bans were often out of stock for much of the first half of 2024 -- and the smart glasses have rarely been discounted. A lot of the appeal is the fact that they look just like normal Ray-Bans, and you can even replace the lenses with your own glasses prescription. Also: The best Cyber Monday deals: Live updates The caveat to keep in mind here is that Amazon sells eight different styles of the Meta Ray-Bans, and it's the classic black frames with green tinted lenses that are on sale for the lowest price. Other styles cost $30 to $80 more. For example, if you want to wear these smart glasses both inside and outside, then you can get a pair with transition lenses. Those normally retail for $379, but Amazon is offering them 20% off, for $303. I tried the Meta Ray-Bans earlier this year and was much more impressed than I expected. First, to be clear, they are augmented reality glasses, but they're audio-only, so there's no screen overlaid on the lenses. All the feedback comes through the speakers that down-fire into your ears and are hidden in the arms of the glasses. Also: Why Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses are my favorite tech purchase this year I was also pleasantly surprised by the audio quality. For phone calls and conference calls and for listening to podcasts and audiobooks, the sound is nearly as bright and clear as a pair of AirPods or other quality earbuds. For listening to music, movies, or shows with lots of bass and surround sound effects, the Meta Ray-Bans are acceptable but not nearly as robust as a pair of high-end headphones from Apple, Sony, Bose, and others. And because of the open concept, naturally the Meta Ray-Bans can't offer the kind of noise cancellation that you get from AirPods Pro or the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds, for example. All in all, the sound of the Meta Ray-Bans is similar to what you get from the AirPods Pro in transparency mode. But, the Meta Ray-Bans can also do things that no headphones can do. They have a built-in 12-megapixel ultrawide camera for taking photos and capturing videos. This camera is about the same quality as an iPhone 12 or a Samsung Galaxy S20. It only takes photos and videos in portrait mode, but it's far faster to tap the button on top of the right arm of the glasses than it is to pull your camera out of your pocket. The Meta Ray-Bans also have a built-in AI assistant that you can trigger by saying "Hey Meta," and use the large language models that Meta has been furiously building over the past several years. For basic information searches, it works well and is another nice option for leaving your phone in your pocket. The battery life is about a half-day with moderate use, but you can quickly charge to about 50% with 20 minutes in the included case. The case itself charges via standard USB-C, which is nice. You can nearly double the battery by turning off the "Hey Meta" listening feature -- which I did. Meta also regularly rolls out software updates that bring new functionality to the Meta Ray-Bans. For example, during 2024 the Meta Ray-Bans added the capability of translating from Spanish to English in real time and the ability to do a visual search to identify landmarks or translate street signs. And Meta says it will continue to add new features such as helping you remember things you've seen, like your parking spot. Also: The best Apple deals for Cyber Monday 2024 If you're concerned about the way Meta handles privacy -- as many of us are -- the good thing about the Meta Ray-Bans is that they don't require a Facebook account. While they do require a Meta account, you can at least ostensibly keep them separate from your Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp data. That makes it easier for me to recommend the product from a privacy perspective. Don't get me wrong, the AirPods Pro 2 are available for a great deal at $153 ($97 off) for Black Friday and Cyber Monday. But the Meta Ray-Bans can do nearly all that the AirPods Pro can do and more. And since smart glasses are getting more and more common and the promise of smarter AI-powered features are on the horizon, getting a pair of Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses gives you a better chance of getting a taste of the future. Deals are subject to sell out or expire at any time, though ZDNET remains committed to finding, sharing, and updating the best product deals for you to score the best savings. Our team of experts regularly checks in on the deals we share to ensure they are still live and obtainable.

Full Content:
We have now updated our massive collection of Black Friday deals, the Google sale is already live, and Samsung is in full swing, but there’s even more we want to bring to your attention. Firstly, Backbone One USB-C – one of the best Android mobile game controllers – is now seeing solid price drops, but we also have Samsung’s originally $600 34-inch Odyssey G5 165Hz WQHD curved gaming monitor at just $265 as well. A fresh collection of Google Nest deals are also live – Nest Doorbell and cameras are now now up to $100 off – and we have some seriously notable deals on ultra-affordable A9+ and S6 Samsung Galaxy tabs from $149. Everything else awaits below. If you’re looking for a super affordable 2024 tablet for casual browsing, video chatting, or even something for the whole fam, the Amazon Black Friday sale is now offering Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S6 Lite Android tablet down at $199.99 shipped. Regularly $330, this is $130 off, $30 below the early Black Friday sale price, and within $0.50 of the lowest we have ever tracked. This is easily one of the most notable deals we have tracked since its release back in April and among the most affordable Samsung tablets we have seen to date that actually ships with the S Pen in the box. It is worth noting that the Galaxy Tab S6 comes in at roughly $50 more than the Black Friday deal we are tracking on the brand’s other ultra-affordable tab, the Galaxy Tab A9+ at $149 shipped. However, as alluded to above, the S6 is a more complete experience with slightly better specs and includes the Samsung S Pen so you can sketch and doodle away without spending any more money. Featured deal: Roborock is launching its biggest deals of the year for Black Friday 2024, delivering up to 67% in savings on many of its most sought-after smart cleaning bots. The Roborock Qrevo series is seeing as much as $650 in savings ahead of Thanksgiving this year alongside up to $700 off the going rate on a range of other models in its lineup of intelligent vacuum and mopping systems. The Roborock deals kick off starting from $140 this year and you’ll find some highlights listed below: The Google Black Friday sale is now live, we are tracking the very first price drop on the all-new Google Nest Learning Thermostat 4th Gen, and now it’s time to take a look at the rest of this year’s Google Nest Black Friday offers. Alongside the new smart thermostat deal, we are also tracking price drops on the latest Nest Cam Outdoor or Indoor Battery model as well as the wired indoor variants and the Google Nest Doorbell down at $99.98 shipped in all colorways. This includes both the wireless and the wired options for folks looking to integrate the smart video doorbell into an existing chime and power system. Everything you need to know about the all-time low now live on the brand new Google Nest Learning Thermostat (4th Gen) is waiting right here. Featured deal: Narwal has now kicked off its official 2024 Black Friday sale with both its latests and greatest intelligent cleaning bots alongside some ultra-affordable models at under $280. You’ll find its latest flagship model with a massive $400 in savings as well as Freo X – it most powerful model – at its lowest price ever with 50% in savings, not to mention a solid $100 price drop on its “one-pass perfection” upright vacuum and mop solution. As part of its Black Friday deals, Amazon is offering one of the best gaming monitor deals by dropping Samsung’s 34-inch Odyssey G55T 165Hz WQHD curved gaming monitor to $265.04 shipped. This originally $600 gaming display has fetched as much as $500 in recent months, but it has mostly been sitting at the $380 mark. We saw it drop to $300 over a month ago in September, but today’s Black Friday deal at Amazon lands it $35 below that price to mark a new all-time low. This is easily one of the best gaming monitor deals we’ve tracked over the last few weeks for Black Friday, and you can learn more about this model below. Featured deal: The Yaber Black Friday sale has arrived with hundreds in savings across its lineup of home projectors starting from just $133. The brand’s K3 Google TV projector solution provides direct access to Netflix and 7,000 other apps, with JBL audio, and a design ready for both indoor and outdoor use. Providing screen sizes that put your smart TV to shame at a fraction of the price you’ll spend on even the most affordable models, many of them include Google Assistant voice command control alongside auto instant setup tech to have you up and running in no time. Scope out the deals below: As part of its Black Friday Week deals, Amazon is offering Samsung’s latest 49-inch Odyssey G9 (G95C) gaming monitor for $759.98 shipped. This particular gaming display has been sitting at the $1,000 mark lately with some occasional jumps to its full $1,300 price. Today’s 42% or $540 discount on its listed price knocks this model $40 below its previous Amazon all-time low, marking a new low price to beat. The same monitor is currently fetching $800 directly at Samsung as a part of its ongoing Black Friday sale, and you can learn more about it below. The official Samsung Black Friday sale continues and we are now tracking even deeper deals on its latest foldable, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6. Both of these handsets debuted earlier this year as the brand’s latest and greatest in foldable handsets and we are now tracking massive price drops on unlocked units with as much as $800 in savings before you even factor in the trade-in values. Scope out the details below. After dishing out its official 18-page Black Friday Holiday Gift Guide last week, Razer has now kicked off its main Black Friday 2024 sale event with huge savings of up to 60%. The brand is calling it the Cyber Weekend Specials and offering a ton of fresh deals on everything from gaming peripherals to big ticket items like its Blade gaming laptops. It’s even offering a “mystery Razer Swag item” with orders above $199 while stock lasts on its site. All of that and more discounted pieces of Razer gaming gear are waiting for you down below. The Samsung Black Friday sale is now live, but so is the Amazon Black Friday Week Deals, and the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro price drops are now at the ready. While you will find the regularly $250 flagship earbuds marked down to $189.99 shipped directly from Samsung, Amazon is sweetening the pot significantly with its own deal price at $188.98 shipped alongside a FREE $20 Amazon gift card with purchase. That’s a total value of $270 and of $81 in effective savings when you factor in the value of the gift card you’ll be able to use towards additional Black Friday deals if you order sooner than not. As per usual, if you have some gear to trade-in against the new Galaxy Buds Pro 3, you can score an up to $100 instant trade-in credit against the already marked down purchase price here. That would leave you with a price at $90 for the new 2024 in-ears, and the lowest price on the internet, but only if you have some gear to flip in the holster. As you likely by now, the official 2024 Google Black Friday sale is live with the best deals we have tracked on just about all of its latest Pixel gear. But for folks not bothered by the latest and greatest releases, the Pixel Watch 2 just dropped to a new Amazon all-time low as part of the retailer’s Black Friday Week Deals. You’ll now find Pixel Watch 2 in various colorways starting down at $145 shipped, or $105 under the current going rate. It is important to remember, however, that this smartwatch carried a regular price of $350 before Google officially lowered the MSRP when the Pixel Watch 3 released. The official Samsung Black Friday sale is now live with massive price drops on a huge selection of its latest tech, wearables, smartphones, and smart TVs included. You will find its latest Galaxy Watch 7 now starting down at $239.99 in the 40mm size alongside the 44mm going for $269.99 shipped, but Amazon now has those prices beat. While the band color and style options are a little bit more limited at Amazon, you’ll now find the 40mm Galaxy Watch 7 starting down at $202.60 and the 44mm model starting at $247.48 shipped. Regularly $300 and $330, respectively, you’re looking at nearly $100 in savings here – more specifically over $97 and $82 off. Update: The deals below also now come along with a $90 Amazon credit! If you were waiting for Black Friday 2024 deals to cop Ray-Ban’s Meta smart glasses, then now is your time to strike as they’re seeing a 20% discount right now. This Black Friday offer, which is now live at Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and even Meta’s online store, applies to every frame and style of the Meta Ray-Bans including Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner starting from $239.20 shipped. This is the best deal we’ve tracked for this piece of wearable that hasn’t seen many discounts, so you might want to grab them while supplies last. Head below for more details. The official OnePlus Black Friday deals are now live and up for grabs directly from the official OnePlus site. Spanning its entire range of latest-generation tech, from the OnePlus 12 and Open foldable right through to the Watch 2R, pro-grade buds, and the OnePlus Tab 2, we are looking at some of the best prices of the year. Head below for a rundown of the exact Black Friday OnePlus deal prices – there’s up to $500 off smartphones as well as a host of freebie earbud add-ons thrown in across the lineup alongside the straight up cash markdowns here. OnePlus Black Friday smartphone deals OnePlus Watch Black Friday deals OnePlus Buds Black Friday deals OnePlus Pad Black Friday deals While we are now seeing sizable price drops on the Samsung Frame smart TVs at up to $1,300 off, the 2024 Hisense models are now also sitting at Amazon all-time lows as part of its Black Friday Week Deals. The Hisense CanvasTV delivers a very smilier picture frame-style experience as Samsung, just at a much lower price and with a display running on the Google TV platform. The 55-inch model is now on sale for $699.99 shipped and the 75-incher is going for $799.99 shipped. Regularly $1,000 and $1,300, respectively, you’re looking at 30% price drops to deliver the lowest prices we can find. Update: Amazon has now dropped prices even lower on both the single and 4-pack of the latest Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2 items trackers as part of its Black Friday Week Deals. Alongside singles down at just $19.49 Prime shipped, Amazon has now knocked the 4-pack of Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2 items trackers down to $59.48 shipped. Regularly $100, this is 38% off and the lowest price we have tracked on Amazon all-time. There were a couple fleeting Woot deals that had the 4-pack for a few bucks less than this, but are talking about a new Amazon low here that is only $3+ more than the best price ever. This is $15.50 per tracker. The super rare deals in the Arc Black Friday sale are now live. We have already featured the offers available on the brand’s popular Bumper Cases for iPhone, and now it’s time to look at the Samsung Galaxy side of the lineup. Price drops on the brand’s popular bumper-style cases are rare at best, outside of our exclusive discounts that is, but the Black Friday deals are offering 15% off sitewide to deliver the best deals we have tracked all year. You’ll find options for the Samsung S24 Ultra as well as the previous-generation S23 and S22 Ultra models starting from just over $38 right now – click this link and hit up the pull-down menu in the top left corner to find the Galaxy models (final discounted prices appear in the cart). Head below for more details. As part of its now live early access Black Friday deals, Samsung is offering up to $1,300 in savings on its latest model The Frame smart TVs. While several models and sizes are now either matching or slightly below our previous mentions directly from Samsung, you’ll also want to double check with Amazon as it is now doing its usual thing, slightly undercutting the direct prices by a few bucks on several sizes. Pricing kicks off from $550 shipped today (or $548 over at Amazon) and you can head below to scope out the deals across the various sizes of the 2024 Samsung The Frame lineup. As a part of its now live Black Friday sale, Samsung is offering its Galaxy Chromebook Plus in Neptune Blue for $599.99 shipped. That’s $100 off a brand new Chromebook that debuted last month carrying a $700 price tag. Today’s deal lands the first discount for this Chromebook Plus machine, marking a new low price to beat. It comes with all the bells and whistles you’d expect from a modern Chromebook out there, and you can learn more about it below. Samsung is now offering the best prices we have tracked to date on its brand new Tab S10 Ultra and Plus model tablets at up to $230 off before trade-ins. While we have featured some elevated trade-in values alongside some instant Samsung credit without trades, there’re now straight up cash savings on top of all of it. The official Samsung site is now offering the Galaxy Tab S10+ starting at $849.99 shipped from the usual $1,000 sticker price as well as the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra starting at $999.99 shipped, down from the regular $1,200. That’s $150 and $200 in savings, the best straight up cash deals to date, and the lowest prices we can find anywhere, but the deals get even sweeter with bonus credits and with higher storage capacity configurations. Head below for the details.

UPDATED 10:16 EST / NOVEMBER 29 2024 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof It’s time to get ready for Amazon Web Services’ re:Invent conference, starting Monday in Las Vegas — the biggest cloud computing conference of the year. To prepare, check out our new Special Report: AI and the Cloud, with exclusive features, interviews and analysis, and all the important news starting next week. We take a deep dive into AWS’ Annapurna Labs chip operation, whose products we’ll hear a lot about at re:Invent, and also analyze the prospects for AI’s hottest new thing, agents, as well as the considerable challenges to their roll-out. That’s also certain to be a hot topic at the event. In addition, theCUBE Research analyst John Furrier interviewed top AWS executives ahead of re:Invent, including CEO Matt Garman, AI and data chief Swami Sivasubramanian, enterprise solutions head Colleen Aubrey, developer experience VP Deepak Singh, and Dilip Kumar, head of Q for Business. We’ll have all the news next week from re:Invent keynotes and interviews, along with analysis from theCUBE Research and interviews on theCUBE. In other news this past week, big money continued to roll into cybersecurity as Halcyon raised $100 million and N-able acquired Adlumin for $266 million. TheCUBE Research Chief Analyst Dave Vellante assessed his 2024 predictions. ChatGPT gave him an A-, but he gave himself a B. This week saw a mixed bag of earnings reports ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, but some significant guidance disappointments from Dell, HP, CrowdStrike and Workday weighed on stocks. Meantime, Pony AI’s IPO disappointed as well. Lots of earnings reports are coming next week too, among them Hewlett Packard Enterprise, UiPath, Salesforce and Zscaler. Here’s the news and analysis this week from SiliconANGLE and beyond: Check out our newest special report on the intersection of cloud and AI, ahead of AWS’ annual re:Invent conference Dec. 2-6 in Las Vegas. As at just about every tech conference these days, AI will be the star. We’ll have all the news from re:Invent, plus exclusive interviews from theCUBE and analysis from theCUBE Research. First up is our deep dive into Annapurna Labs, Amazon’s accelerator chip operation in Austin, Texas: Amazon’s secretive AI weapon: An exclusive look inside AWS’ Annapurna Labs chip operation We took a deep dive into the promises and perils of agentic AI, which will be a prime topic at re:Invent — and just about every tech conference after that: Safety and reliability concerns temper agentic AI mania And a closer look at the challenges underneath the hype: AI agents are practical. Reliability is another matter John Furrier also interviewed the exec driving AWS into enterprise applications: Colleen Aubrey: Leading AWS’ bold path into enterprise solutions as well as VP of AI and Data Swami Sivasubramanian: Inside the AI revolution: Swami Sivasubramanian on generative AI, agentic systems and AWS’ vision. He also interviewed Deepak Singh, VP of Next Generation Developer Experience at AWS: Revolutionizing software development: Deepak Singh on gen AI, AWS Q Developer and the future of coding and Q chief Dilip Kumar on the coming golden age of business productivity: Transforming how business works: Dilip Kumar on Q for Business, gen AI and AWS’ vision for productivity Furrier will have more posts on his exclusive interviews with AWS execs ahead of re:Invent, in particular Sunday evening with AWS CEO Matt Garman. Dave Vellante did pretty well on his 2024 predictions, many of which not surprisingly involved AI: Breaking Analysis: Grading our 2024 enterprise technology predictions A couple of angles on AI governance: A guide from Intellyx’s Jason Bloomberg: How to get a handle on generative AI governance and a post-election perspective from Holistic AI’s Emre Kazim: Corporate reputation trumps Trump when it comes to AI safety A customarily provocative post from Gary Marcus asks if generative AI scaling is hitting a wall: A new AI scaling law shell game?

When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more Whether you're a gamer or know one yourself, Cyber Monday's gaming deals are worth checking out for upgrading your devices and curating gifts. However, we recommend you snag them fast since the best Cyber Monday gaming deals are likely going to expire after today. Gaming consoles, Switch accessories, and PC peripherals are all on sale for all-time low prices. The highly-coveted PS5 Digital Edition is $75 off. Meanwhile, you can save $50 on the Xbox Series X Digital Edition. PC gamers can also secure deep discounts on powerful gaming laptops, like this Dell system with an Intel Core i9 and RTX 4070 for $200 off. Find the best Cyber Monday gaming deals on products we recommend below. If you're gift shopping, check out our guide to the best Cyber Monday deals for sales across all categories, including home, kitchen, tech, and more. For Cyber Monday, Nintendo is offering a great bundle that includes a Switch console, a free copy of Mario Kart 8, and a one-year Nintendo Switch online membership. The bundle was available for $50 off, but that deal sold out. However, even at full price the bundle still saves you about $80 compared to buying the console, game, and membership separately. This bundle includes a standard Nintendo Switch console, a download code for Mario Kart 8, and a 12-month membership to Nintendo Switch online. Even at full price, this package already saves you about $80 compared to buying the console, game, and subscription separately. Highlights Inspired by Nintendo's popular Legend of Zelda franchise, this bundle includes a gold-colored Switch Lite console and a 12-month membership to Nintendo Switch Online. The typical combined price of both items would be $250, so this bundle saves you around $40. The 8BitDo Ultimate is comfortable, highly customizable, and comes with a convenient charging dock. The PowerA Enhanced Wired Controller for Nintendo Switch is a full-sized gamepad that offers bigger buttons, better joysticks, and extra customizable buttons. The Spectra model also has color-changing LED lights. The Tomtoc Carrying Case comes with an integrated stand that lets you play your Switch while charging it. This Ivoler case can be carried with a handle or shoulder strap. It's big enough to fit a Switch, dock, controller, and 18 game cards. Microsoft is offering an excellent selection of Cyber Monday gaming deals, including discounts on various Xbox consoles and accessories. The Xbox Series X Digital Edition is down to an all-time low of $398 while the 512GB Xbox Series S is $50 off at Walmart. This Series X model offers the same graphical performance as the standard edition but it does not include a disc drive. It typically costs $50 less than the disc-drive model. The Xbox Series S isn't as powerful as the Series X, but it still benefits from Xbox Game Pass and Microsoft's robust online services, offering great value for less money. The iconic Xbox Core controller works with various Xbox systems, but it can also connect to your PC, iPhone, iPad, or Android. Microsoft’s official battery pack for the Xbox wireless controller replaces the standard AA batteries and can be charged with the controller’s usual USB cable. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X shares many features with the more expensive Nova Pro, like a noise-canceling microphone and wireless cross-platform support, while maintaining a midrange price. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate offers a Netflix-style subscription with hundreds of games for Xbox and PC, along with online multiplayer support. Members can also stream games on mobile devices, Samsung TVs, and select Fire TV sticks. An Ultimate membership typically costs $20, but most retailers sell one month for $17. PlayStation 5 systems and accessories are seeing great discounts for Cyber Monday. The Digital Edition console is down to a new low of $374. Meanwhile, the PS5 with disc drive is available for $75 off, and this PS VR2 bundle is a whopping $250 off. And though not discounted, the brand-new PS5 Pro is in stock for its regular price of $699. The PS5 is one of the best gaming consoles you can buy thanks to its powerful hardware, unique controller, and exclusive games. This model includes a disc drive and some free Fortnite content, like in-game outfits and weapons. The PS5 Slim Digital Edition doesn't include a disc drive, but you can buy one later on for $80 if you decide you want to play game discs later on. This package features some Fortnite-related freebies, including in-game outfits and weapons. This bundle includes a slim disc-drive edition PlayStation 5 console with a copy of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the latest entry in the popular action RPG franchise. With this bundle, buyers get a slim PlayStation 5 console with disc drive and a copy of Madden NFL 25, the latest game in the long-running football series. The PS VR2 is a virtual reality headset built for the PS5. It also supports a PC adapter (sold separately for $60) that can pair with computers to play SteamVR games. This bundle includes a copy of Horizon Call of the Mountain. Sony's DualSense controller improves on the classic PlayStation design with haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, USB-C, charging, a built-in mic, and a longer battery life. These wireless earbuds are designed for gaming with a PS5 or PC. They support active noise cancellation and a 2.4GHz wireless connection for lag-free playback. This wired gaming headset has a white color scheme that's designed to match the PS5 console. It has a boom microphone for voice chat that can be flipped up to mute. You can now snag a Quest 3S bundle that includes the 128GB headset, the new Batman: Arkham Shadow game, and a three-month Meta Quest+ subscription for a total of $299. You can learn more about the 3S VR headset in our Meta Quest 3S review. The Quest 3S is Meta's most affordable VR headset. It has the same chipset and gaming performance as the pricier Quest 3, but its display isn't as sharp. This is an excellent fit for casual users who want a more budget-friendly entry into the world of VR. This is a great time to buy, as you'll get a free download of the Batman: Arkham Shadow game (worth $50) and three months of Meta Quest+ (worth $24). The larger 256GB model of the new Quest 3S is for the more dedicated VR fan keen on downloading and storing a larger number of games and apps at once. VR newcomers would be better off saving some cash with the 128GB model in our book, though. Otherwise, you're getting the same excellent value headset, and all purchases currently include a code for the super-fun Batman: Arkham Shadow game (a $50 value). You're also getting three months of Meta Quest+ (worth $24). The slightly older Meta Quest 3 VR headset builds on its predecessor with mixed reality capabilities, 4K resolution, an upgraded processor that offers double the speed, and new ergonomics for the head unit and controllers. Like the newer 3S model it also comes with a free download code for the new Batman: Arkham Shadow VR game (worth $50). The larger 512GB version is the only one remaining, as the smaller ones have now been discontinued. PC and laptop gamers can save tons on new systems during Cyber Monday. Right now, the Asus TUG A15 gaming laptop is down to $999 which is just $20 more than the lowest price it's ever dipped to. We're also seeing great deals on monitors, like this 50% discount on Samsung's 43-inch Odyssey Neo G7. The Asus TUF is built with military-grade shock resistance, and its incredibly powerful battery can last for around nine hours on a single charge. This model of the X16 R2 by Asus has powerful specs to run almost any demanding game at high frames-per-second on its large 16-inch QHD 240Hz display. Alienware's AW3225QF is the first 4K QD-OLED monitor and one of the few 4K displays you can get with a 240Hz refresh rate. It's expensive but delivers stunning performance while setting a new benchmark for gaming displays. The Samsung Odyssey Neo series offers 4K image quality in a sleek and stylish package. They’re among the best gaming monitors on the market. The Asus ROG Ally is a handheld gaming PC with Windows 11. Its hardware is powerful enough to run nearly any game, but its control issues make it awkward to use. The Razer Basilisk V3 Pro delivers smooth movement, cool RGB lighting, plenty of buttons, and a high-quality design that feels great in-hand. It’s our pick for the best wireless gaming mouse you can buy. The Logitech G305 Lightspeed is an excellent choice for entry-level users, casual gamers, and those shopping on a budget. Despite being one of the most affordable wireless gaming mice on the market, it doesn't compromise quality or performance, and it's almost always on sale. See more of our Cyber Monday roundups The PS5 and Xbox Series X are both powerful gaming consoles with similar graphical capabilities. However, they each have pros and cons. Our gaming experts think the PS5 has an edge in exclusive games, with franchises like Marvel's Spider-Man, The Last of Us, God of War, Ratchet & Clank, Astro Bot, and Ghosts of Tsushima that you can't play on Xbox systems. We also prefer the PS5's DualSense controller since it has extra perks like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. Xbox consoles have their own exclusive titles as well, including Halo and Starfield, but the selection isn't as large and Microsoft is starting to experiment with releasing some of its first-party games on the PS5. However, the Xbox Series X has an edge in multimedia capabilities and its Game Pass subscription service, which offers tons of titles, including brand-new releases the day they launch in stores. Ultimately, you can't go wrong with either system, but the PS5's exclusive titles and unique controller make it a slightly better option for gamers who don't want to miss out on big releases. Check out our PS5 vs. Xbox Series X comparison for more details. Top gaming PCs and laptops feature components built to handle modern games at stable frame rates, along with support for features like ray tracing and AI upscaling. This makes them notably more expensive than typical computers designed for everyday use. High-end gaming desktops and laptops can cost more than $3,000 but entry-level options with solid specifications can be found for around $800 to $1,000. When shopping for a gaming computer the most important spec to look at is the graphics card. Nvidia and AMD are the top brands in graphics cards, and they both sell excellent options. However, Nvidia's top GPUs are typically more powerful, and the company's RTX 40-series cards have a feature called "Deep Learning Super Sampling" (DLSS), which can improve frame rates with AI. Meanwhile, AMD's graphics cards tend to be a little less powerful by are also often less expensive. For the best gaming performance, we recommend focusing on PCs and laptops that have an Nvidia RTX 4050 graphics card or higher. Shopping for more discounts today?

Title: How did Nvidia expand nearly 20-fold in just over 20 years?

Good morning! Hallam Bullock here, once again writing to you from London. Black Friday is upon us and Business Insider's Reviews team has rounded up the best deals on the products and brands they swear by. In today's newsletter, we're looking at how Nvidia expanded nearly 20-fold in just over 20 years. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. A few years ago, Nvidia was largely unknown. It's difficult to believe, considering the company can now boast about back-to-back earnings beats, a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion, and a stock price that has climbed nearly 200% over the past 12 months — Citi analysts also recently eyed a catalyst that could push the stock a further 27% by January. So, how can a company grow so much, so quickly? The data behind the evolution of Nvidia's workforce tells the story, BI's Emma Cosgrove writes. Nvidia's workforce has grown nearly 20-fold since 2003. Beyond its historic rise in market value, this growth has been aided by a slew of employee incentives, including a futuristic headquarters that reflects the company's "no barriers and no boundaries" philosophy (it's easy to see why they named the building "Voyager"). This workforce growth continued through 2024, a particularly brutal year for the Tech industry, during which time Meta and Google made significant cuts. It's one of the best-paying firms in Silicon Valley. In 2019, Microsoft's median employee salary was nearly $20,000 higher than a Nvidia worker. As of January 2024, Nvidia's median salary (excluding the CEO) had surpassed Microsoft and reached more than $220,000. As the above chart illustrates, it's also left other tech giants in the dust. Nvidia's revenue per employee has recovered after years of investment. The company's revenue-to-headcount ratio showed a downward trend from 2003 until 2014, and then steady upward progress until the AI boom in 2023. During that year, this ratio doubled. This is in part due to early investment in building a programming software layer called CUDA — the main element that keeps AI builders from easily switching to competing hardware. However, the company isn't as far ahead in other areas. Gender representation in the company's workforce and the semiconductor industry as a whole has remained relatively unchanged in the last decade, Emma writes.

Russia is close to an autarky these days, and it banks are not exposed, so this is less consequential than it might seem. If I had to guess, the Russian very high inflation plays a big role, particularly if interest rates are deemed to be too low in light of that. But it may just as well have to do with technical matters, like Russia (generally? always?) requiring FX trades to be crossed on the Moscow Stock Exchange. While this greatly increases the value of Russia’s energy exports in home country terms and should boost inbound tourism, Russians who normally travel to warmer countries for vacations will likely shelve those plans for now. Historically a low rouble has been seen, like depressed stock prices, as a sign within Russia of weakness. I don’t know if that is as true now as it was historically. A more granular take: What is happening with the ruble? The ruble has experienced the most significant rate of devaluation since August 2023. Compared to the dollar, it has reached lows not seen since mid-March 2022. It's currently trading at 108.1 rubles per USD.

Maybe they even tried to steer him towards IMF loans or something. The fact that the Chinese are acting just like business people may have saved his bacon and explains why he is so happy with them. In a similar vein, from the link to Numb in India with this quote, “…it turns out that if you want someone to administer capitalism well, you could do a lot worse than a Communist Party.” Starmer will vote in favour IMO. Why do I predict that? Our newly elected UK Labour MP was one of the new intake that got immediate promotion to a select committee (thus annoying long-serving MPs). This has confirmed in the minds of everyone round here that he’s a Starmer …. ahem …. loyalist. He posted his letter to Twitter announcing his support in last day or so. He might have hoped it wouldn’t get noticed, given that he’s one of many Labour MPs suddenly to have new Blue-sky accounts. So I screenshot his letter and posted it to my mostly quiet Blue-sky account, tagging him. Irony is I’m probably not his least liked member of my family after my mum wrote rude stuff about him on Facebook within weeks of voting for him at the general election. All fun and games in this very marginal constituency! His track record proves he is all in for the kill https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/starmer-winter-fuel-allowance-pensioners-b2611986.html When did this phrase “assisted dying” get chosen as the message. Euthanasia just sounds bad, can’t get the dogs to.eat the dog food, but assisted dying? That’s all about the actus reus and not about the mens rea. That’s not what I would want: I would want a decriminalisation of the assistance of my suicide, with a boring paper-based process involving the court of protection and some sort of independent medical examination that I am compos mentis. I realise this rules out dementia patients and others who lack capacity but I don’t see how to resolve the dangers in allowing us to choose that others would like to die. A tolerance of the dual effect of opiates in pain relief would be one route, I suppose, provided the person acting on behalf of the incapacitated has explicitly agreed and there was no previously “do not sedate to death” paperwork. Re Russian economy: Yesterday I had a long phonecall with an excellent Russian journalist whom I have known for a long time. We talked about the prospects of an armistice and he believes that chances are quite good. Trump would give Selensky the necessary cover – “the bastard doesn´t want to deliver weapons anymore” – to call it quits and Putin is under a lot of domestic pressure because of inflation. There are also big problems re spareparts for the railways and other economic troubles. I’m hoping your journalist friend is correct. I for one would appreciate moving away from the cliff edge. I propose that no one but NATO should want this result at this stage–least of all Russia. If the conflict freezes prior to the collapse of Ukraine’s military, I’ll bet we will be at war again–and worse–within a few years. Consider how emboldened the Ukrainian regime was by Putin’s restraint and miscalculations in 2022. On net NATO has not yet been chastened, but rather emboldened up to now. That is a recipe for more red-line pushing and more war. Yes. Does one want a “chastened” NATO either? For whom egos could well be strategic assets? Rump Ukraine > Occupied Rump Ukraine. Who cares how they decorate? If they get testy, Russia just goes Grozny and rewilds Galicia. The next generation of Russian soldiers could use a boogeyman that isn’t actually dropping bombs on them at bedtime, also cold war economy go brrrrtttt. Too optimistic?- The Europeans will try to torpedo any kind of agreement. What if they decide to admit Ukraine in the EU (I am not sure this is possible) that is now seen in Russia as NATO proxy? Yea, right. MInsk 3 here we come. All because of that damned inflation, and spareparts for the railways. Economic troubles are so bad that Russians are considering selling the Crimean Bridge. Did…did you just say that if people are convinced that the west is winning in the Ukraine, that the Russians have a bridge to sell us? In typical Yankee Trader style, we will then try to purchase said bridge with gold painted BRICS. Wuk? Is that you? Punsters are proliferating on this site. Sorry, I am but a humble shadow of the refulgent Wukchumni. along with swampland in Florida – Is your contact associated wit the late J Barkley Rosser’s “contacts”? There are the similar voices saying “you did not do enough” on both sides. For the NATO side it is “not enough [effete, V-1 like] super weapons, soon enough, in numbers enough! For the Russian side: “you did not stay the course”. “Staying the course” is less insane than more V-1’s. There are also big problems re spareparts for the railways […] That is sort of surprising to hear since Russian railways have their own gauge and own couplings, which means they’ve always been sort of closed market for the rolling stock. Soviet Union/Russia always (had to) build their own diesel and electric engines, so not much of replacing imports to do, really. And given the strategic significance of the railroads to the military logistics, one would be aghast to find out it has been neglected. Even more surprising is lack of problems with parts for Boeings. Please “Snowless Finns suffer ‘eco-grief” ‘Snow has special meaning for many Finns, often connected to cherished memories, but a lack of snow can cause a sense of loss that researchers refer to as eco-grief.’ It’s those damn Russians. Finland joins NATO. Then suddenly their snow starts going away. Coincidence? I think not! Does the Baltic Sea still freeze in winter, allowing one to wander for kilometers on the ice? Most of it does, but not to the extent it did in the 1950’s. I’m happy my kids have had the experience, but I’m not sure their kids will know the feeling… Damn, those pesky Russians are behind everything. This quote from Anne Karhu-Angeli caught my eye, Snow brings light with it. It’s no longer dark and horrible. You can feel it in your body and your mind,” she says. I have a friend in Alaska who every winter spends two weeks in Oaxaca to beat the endless nights. He has mentioned that this is a thing for those who can manage it, and that the extended winter nights literally drive people crazy. Same thing in all Nordic countries. During winter holidays, those who can fly away to places with a 100% sun-guarantee. Frankly, most of us endure the short period of dark, wet and cold before the permasnow falls and it’s winter wonderland everywhere. Only the weak leaves. For any military purpose they should be filtered away. The real men, wearing pants, stick around and laugh at the darkness while waiting for the snow. Photoperiod is linked to depression to which even real men in pants are susceptible. When the going gets tough, the tough gets going, laughing maniacally through the depression and snow until sometime in May. Lol, my version includes whiskey and maybe a re-read of Blood Meridian. My wife is very susceptible to Seasonal Affective Disorder while I hardly notice it at all. Mind you I haven’t ever lived north of Quebec City. Nothing weak about taking Vitamin D supplements…you don’t even have to wear pants! Yep. Remember when the Chilean trapped miners were supplied with water, food, and vitamin D, specifically, while waiting for their eventual rescue? There was a reason for that. / ;) https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna39000893 Nordic diet, oddly enough, is full of salmon, milk and eggs. Have lived here decades, never taken Vitamin D supplements. Also helps to have a fair skin tone. I am male and have lived on the coast of Alaska most of my adult life. Dont always wear pants. Winter is when i head into the woodshop crank the heat and the tunes crack a beer and start creating something. Spring comes all too soon it seems. When the sun does come out you go for a walk. Sometimes end up with the geezers at local watering hole. Good ideas start there sometimes. I know i live a blessed life. Being a member of AFDU (Alaska functional drunkards union local chapter 86). You cant drink all day if you dont start in the morning. Cheers. I once saw a funny text describing how to determine the temperature without resorting to a graded thermometer. Everything was based on what people from various countries (supposedly) do when the weather becomes colder and colder. Clues such as “Finns finally close the windows before going to sleep”, or “Even your Volvo helps you plan the trip to Tunisia” and the like. The real men, wearing pants, leaping from tree to tree as they float down the mighty rivers of British Columbia … https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfRdur8GLBM&t=6s I lived in Seattle for 35 years. I got around the dark and wet by going on bike rides in the wet and cold. It took a couple of years to figure out how dress correctly and bring multiple pairs of gloves and an extra base layer to change into. Having company to share in the fun misery also helps. For the record there was sometimes alcohol involved and herb. Before you knew it the days get a bit longer and there is light at the end of the tunnel. If possible, and many do, a get away to the SW or warmer parts are a nice option. Now that I have been south for 5 years, I am not sure if I miss it. I do miss the biking crew. Shout out to the PNW riders. Useful Idiots on RU just posted: Ukraine vs. Russia: Nuclear War, Frozen Conflict, or Peace? Debate w/ Simon Shuster Senior Correspondent at TIME Magazine Simon Shuster on newly increased aggression in the Ukraine-Russian War p.s. since I only started – Shuster as expected so far, is – well – in military terms not speaking about Ukraine but some other conflict on Venus or Pluto may be. But not this one. https://www.usefulidiotspodcast.com/p/ukraine-vs-russia-nuclear-war-frozen I wonder what others have to say to this. Because the deep-seated prejudice of Shuster is very unsettling to witness. The disagreement with Maté starts TC 20:00. 99% of what Shuster says is State Department ideology the kind of which doves share. Which is probably worse than nutty people who want to to bomb Russia but would never dare to carry that out. Shuster is undermining serious understanding and makes scrutiny of US responsibility virtually impossible in the future. One point where Maté agrees much too easily is Shuster´s allegation that Putin – of course – was lying around 2015 when neglecting RU troops in Donbas. Jacques Baud has showed that there were no covert RU supportive military operations. What is an undeniable indication that something is fundamentally wrong here – never would Shuster in this context say that e.g. Biden oder Austen or Blinken lied. Putin? YESSSS! WH? neva. p.s.When Shuster says “the genocidal regime” early on it´s hard to wonder why the interview is happening at all. What is the surplus value here? Of course their bulk audience is not just NC-commentariat. But it´s disconcerting. With this kind of mindset I see no way out of this for the next 50 years. This is a closed “cold case.” This is really distressing. Re 2015, the media was braying with one voice that Russia was sending troops and materiel to Donbass. Baud finding for the UN that there were no Russian small arms sent would seen pretty dispositive, since that would be the easiest to provide. The theory I once had, but it does not fit Baud’s facts, is that Russia might have provided deniable support, by allowing Russian soldiers to go what would otherwise be AWOL for some set time to help relatives in Donbass. There’s the evidence of the contemporary Donbass militias that they felt left alone by Russia, and the rather recent personal apology by V.V. Putin for leaving the Donbass alone supporting the narrative that Russia indeed did not provide more than diplomatic support for the militias and population that, shall we say, defended the Ukrainian constitution. That said, Russia is Russia, and as far as autocrats go, Putin has no control over what people do. So if they decide to volunteer for Donbass militias, they will. Oddly enough, there seems to be not so small anti-authoritarian inside every Russian. Shuster is crawling into the rabbit hole with every passing minute of that interview. He is insane. It is getting worse when Halper asks him about WWIII. TC 53:00. Baud revisits the 2015 issue with Eva Bartlett here (I already posted this back then): JACQUES BAUD: NATO THREATENED RUSSIA DECADES BEFORE 2022 27/10/2024 https://rumble.com/v5fjhrh-jacques-baud-nato-threatened-russia-decades-before-2022.html When I listened to it then I made following notes (I have no time now to re-check, sorry): TC – 21:00 Crimea NO green men TC – 33:00 no human rights for minorities TC – 42:00 UKR said officially 2015 no RU Army in Donbas TC – 49:00 Z´s decree 24/3/2021 to conquer South and the Donbas and that led to SMO TC – 51:00 never separatism only autonomy I take a wild guess: Not a word of this in Shuster´s book. p.s. Baud is very difficult to contact as I understand. And just because it fits: “Boris Johnson: ‘Mate, let’s face it… We’re waging a proxy war” https://x.com/RnaudBertrand/status/1862320989432160459 Bertrand: “Wow, this has got to be one of the most ‘saying the quiet part out loud’ statements since the start of the Ukraine war.” But yeah, it´s about Ukrainian agency against a genocidal regime. When did Shuster last look up the definition of genocide. Fortunately Maté didn´t ask him about Gaza. Then I would have probably smashed my computer against the wall – for lack of better – fucking – agency… Nima and Orlov. Pretty straight forward. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neBQhqveeXg&t=9s Time magazine was founded by Henry Luce in 1923. Luce was a big promoter of The American Century idea. https://classicsofstrategy.com/2015/09/16/the-american-century-luce/ The Time’s reportage apples haven’t fallen far from the founder’s tree, so to say. / ;) I think the US ‘deep state’ or establishment realized after this year’s US prez election that podcasts and alt media are important news outlets for a huge number of people. It’s not enough to dismiss the non-MSM as ridiculous and unimportant anymore. (The MSM made themselves ridiculous in the eyes of many over the past few years.) I expect to see more push into the alt outlets by ye olde deep state/establishment actors going forward. It’s an ironic idea that the establishment figures might try to regain credibility by going on alt media and podcasts, not necessarily to tell the truth. / ;) good point! Henry’s wife was Clair Booth Luce, famous in her day as a writer and ardent anti-communist, anti-USSR. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_Boothe_Luce Western Europe and the US opinion of Russia hasn’t changed in 200 years. The form of govt didn’t really matter. Tzarist, Soviet, non-communist, that didn’t really matter to the West, imo. It was and is something else that matters. That something is the fact that Western mineral resources somehow got buried in Russia’s ditch. They are still missing talk radio, which is HUUGE in some parts of the country. Remember the debacle of Air America? See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_America_(radio_network) (I know it’s ‘wiki’ but, well then….) It’s all about that elusive “Big Tent” show. The Democrat/PMC Party has become based on a niche demographic. Love him or hate him, Trump has tapped into a real goldmine of “populist” angst. As Lambert says, without supplying concrete material benefits to the People as a group, not just a donor niche, the Party loses its original reason for existing. Maybe I am dating myself, but I have never listened to a podcast. I enjoyed Joe Rogan on News Radio. And, the last video game I played was Pong. I do listen to talk radio, but it’s so hard to wade through the BS. Henry Luce was the son of American missionaries to China, born in China, and returned to America in his teens. He passionately hated the Communists, and Time magazine was a huge supporter of the Vietnam war. Henry used to spike stories from his reporters in Vietnam and print handouts from the Pentagon instead. In spite of his efforts, some news from Vietnam managed to get through, but not much. After his death from a heart attack in 1968, his wife, Clare Boothe Luce, took over as publisher of his stable of magazines, and continued his anti-communist policies. Well , an entire mass media once promoted a “counterculture” by way of spawn of the military-industrial complex. ‘Why you should have a cat @ShouldHaveCat They know exactly what they’re doing 😂’ My god. I had forgotten that about cats. Sometimes having a cat in your home is like having an unsupervised toddler running around and not noticing them. Rev Kev Indeed! I have seen this same thing as in video! They always seem to have thought out whatever they are doing. Mine will very specifically open a certain drawer or cabinet, even a closet and go after a certain object. I have chastised myself for thinking that they are this smart. They are! I never had cats before these two and I’ve missed out on a whole world of amazing acts. I will have cats in my life forever now. Can’t believe I ever lived without them!

A new Kingdom of “creature,” the AInimalia. ‘The Redheaded libertarian @TRHLofficial The Mayflower passengers who arrived in Plymouth November 11, 1620 vs. The Mayflower passengers who survived to Thanksgiving 1621, less than one year later.’ Looking at the survivors for patterns, I can see a few. Larger families had a better chance of surviving than individuals. Women were heavily hit. And I notice more than a few children/teenagers as well surviving. Of course that is all only first impressions and would need a statistical analysis to see what the real story was. Some food for thought… https://blackagendareport.com/end-american-thanksgivings-cause-universal-rejoicing-1 The End of American Thanksgivings: A Cause for Universal Rejoicing. “The Thanksgiving story is an absolution of the Pilgrims, whose brutal quest for absolute power in the New World is made to seem both religiously motivated and eminently human. Most importantly, the Pilgrims are depicted as victims – of harsh weather and their own naïve yet wholesome visions of a new beginning. In light of this carefully nurtured fable, whatever happened to the Indians, from Plymouth to California and beyond, in the aftermath of the 1621 dinner must be considered a mistake, the result of misunderstandings – at worst, a series of lamentable tragedies. The story provides the essential first frame of the American saga. It is unalloyed racist propaganda, a tale that endures because it served the purposes of a succession of the Pilgrims’ political heirs, in much the same way that Nazi-enhanced mythology of a glorious Aryan/German past advanced another murderous, expansionist mission.” thank you, best thing Glen Ford ever wrote, and he wrote many powerful essays. You also had basically 4 groups: the Puritans, who called themselves the Saints, (everyone else was a sinner), their indentured servants, a few stragglers crazy and well heeled enough to pay their own passage (as in why did they need to really hot-tail it out of England; dunno if any had indentured servants too) and the crew. Of my at least 7 (verified by church birth and death records and/or gravestones) and as many as 11 ancestors on the Mayflower (out of 110 survivors), all were sinners. Not sure about this “saint/sinner” dichotomy. AFAIK, Pilgrim theology was pretty much orthodox Reformed, with double pre-destination meaning that there was the concept of the Elect of God. But I don’t think it was ever a belief that the Elect were/are free from sin, except in the sense of Baptism and original sin. For example the Westminster Confession Chapt 11: “4. God did, from all eternity, decree to justify all the elect, and Christ did, in the fullness of time, die for their sins, and rise again for their justification: nevertheless, they are not justified, until the Holy Spirit doth, in due time, actually apply Christ unto them. 5. God doth continue to forgive the sins of those that are justified; and, although they can never fall from the state of justification, yet they may, by their sins, fall under God’s fatherly displeasure, and not have the light of his countenance restored unto them, until they humble themselves, confess their sins, beg pardon, and renew their faith and repentance.” What is missing from the discussion is the politics. Bear in mind that the King of England was the head of the Church of England (CoE) and any attempt to create a church based on your own religious ideas was not only dangerous but viewed as contempt for the monarchy and could easily land you in jail or worse. Thus, for example, Roman Catholics were automatically targeted because they looked to the Pope for religious guidance rather than the king who at the time of the Mayflower was King James I. Two groups, the Puritans and Separatists, were prominent. The Puritans wanted reform but they remained within the CoE, as well as England. The Separatists wanted freedom from the CoE, hence the name Separatists, because they saw no reason the king should be involved in religious matters. Facing arrest and persecution, the Separatists first emigrated to Holland where they lived for 12-years. When conditions in Holland became dangerous they succeeded in obtaining a contract from London for a settlement in the new world. The Separatists who left Holland and boarded the Mayflower became known as Pilgrims to distinguish them from the Separatists that remained in Europe. By 1620, Jamestown was a settlement but the Pilgrims wanted their own colony to distance themselves from the king in order to not be persecuted in the new world as they were in England. I think their rebellion against the King of England is worth remembering. Aftonbladet tells us that assisted dying is on the docket in England and its captive nation, Wales. The headline is: “British Parliament votes on euthanasia” Two thoughts: — For whom? And will there be less parading around by the members in silly costumes with props like maces? — Will anyone notice if the brain-dead English elite is euthanized? I think that we all know that assistance in dying has gone on since time immemorial. Pneumonia is called the old-man’s friend. There is a debate in Italy as to exactly what women in Sardinia who took on the roles of an abbacadora did in easing death. The irony here is that people now want to schedule their deaths. PS: Of course, zombies exist in the U.S. of A., too. Steny Hoyer, at the age of 172, was just returned to the Congress. I don’t subscribe to the idea that the voters are stupid, but I sure would like to know what kind of stun drugs are in the moo juice in southern Maryland. Tsk. It will never be the old and powerful who are urged and encouraged to ‘go.’ It will be the inconvenient, the old powerless and costly, the politically problematic who urged (maybe even pushed) to go. Simple look at what is happening in Canada. In the UK, if this passes, watch the push on the disabled or costly old people to ‘go’ as a civic duty to save the NHS. You no doubt think I’m kidding or wildly exaggerating. Reminds me of the Reichs Ministry of Racial Purity and its campaign to ‘normalize’ suicide and “assisted” suicide. All done in the interests of “The Greater Good.” When I read or hear that, I know that I should get out of there as quickly as possible. No ‘Good’ can come of it. Aktion-4 does have that neoliberal feel about it. Much of the propaganda over the “life unworthy of life” was over how much it cost the state to care for someone who was disabled. Note, the argument was not that it was unaffordable to care for the disabled, but rather that it was just expensive. Thank you, JBird4049. As someone raised in the Christian tradition of life, the idea that their are some peoples’ “life unworthy of life” is abhorrent to me on basic principles. See also the medieval Christian hospitallers (from whence comes the modern hospital idea) of charities care for the ill. Throw the ill outside the town’s gate to die, or care for them as our fellow humans. I haven’t seen any evidence of actual oversight in Canada. And if there is any, it is always post mortem… Israeli scorpion gotta 🦂 https://x.com/RaniaKhalek/status/1862397943195562124 https://thecradle.co/articles-id/27889 That article says that Hezbollah are waiting for the Lebanese army to deploy but the army itself has no illusions what the Israelis are all about. Several times during the past few weeks the Israelis deliberately murdered troops of the Lebanese army with an airstrike for no reason whatsoever. The commander of Lebanon’s Armed Forces has just briefed the government on their plans for deployment but he also refused to go into any detail or say where Lebanese soldiers would have their barracks. And that can only be because he is not willing to show his plans to the Israelis. They are quite capable of bombing a barracks full of Lebanese troops on the grounds that they are not effective enough in disarming Hezbollah forces as a sort of message- https://thecradle.co/articles/beirut-in-the-dark-about-lebanese-armys-deployment-plan-for-south-lebanon-report The AP report on Cyprus becoming a member of NATO is like some letter from some fantasy land. Cyprus is a well-kept mess for the convenience of the bigger states involved. Note the mention of Turkey having 35,000 in the occupied / breakaway north. This is on a small island with a total population of roughly one million. From WIkipedia: “The Turkish invasion, the ensuing occupation and the declaration of independence by the TRNC have been condemned by United Nations resolutions, which are reaffirmed by the Security Council every year.[126]” Meanwhile, the final paragraph is a piece of self-defeat: “Cyprus’ Andreas Papandreou air base on its southwestern edge is currently hosting a U.S. Marine contingent and a number of V-22 Osprey tiltrotor military transport and cargo aircraft prepositioned to assist in potential evacuations from nearby Lebanon and elsewhere.” I’m taken aback that this base is named after socialist politician Andreas Papandreou. Natch, there is no mention of the U.K. extraterritorial carved-out bases of Akrotiri and Dhekelia. So Cyprus is just a little Ukraine waiting to happen. Can’t see the Turks voting to let Cyprus into NATO. If it happened, that Greek part of Cyprus would be quickly overrun with NATO bases for troops and ships and would become a festung in the eastern Mediterranean. And that would mean that all sorts of pressure could be brought to bear on the Turkish part of the island, even though they are in NATO as well, and maybe forcing some sort of deal on them. That is one headache that the Turks do not need. Re: Turkey Propaganda Word on the street was that turkey outside Wilmington, NC was $0.29 / lb., so maybe that was the ‘Farm Bureau’ price. Somehow I doubt that was the price at Whole Foods. My better half bought a turkey the day before Thanksgiving for around that amount per pound, which was a heavily discounted sale price. Normally you see that price the day after, but maybe they hadn’t sold as briskly ahead of time as the store expected. She also just paid $5.00 for a dozen of the cheap eggs. Organic/cage free were quite a bit more. I showed those stats to my MIL who cooked dinner yesterday. Her dinner for 20 was well over the $116.00 the Farm Bureau estimates. Ian Welsh is clear and to the point. I have nothing else to add except that he’s spot on. The resistance will be picked apart one by one. Not so sure about that. Maybe Welsh hasn’t been keeping up on current events but the Israelis have just had their a**** handed to them by Hezbollah. Remember, Hezbollah has their base in the Lebanese people and if they had let the massacres by the Israelis to continue, would have led to the loss of support of their base which is why the – temporary – truce. Hezbollah has used a fair number of their rockets up but they made to make sure that the really good stuff was kept stored. As it is, the north of Israel remains unstable and people are afraid to move back there which will roil Israeli politics. And five IDF divisions and more have been badly mauled by Hezbollah with thousands of Israeli casualties. If this is an Israeli victory, then it is a Pyrrhic victory. Maybe Welsh hasn’t been keeping up on current events but the Israelis The current events indicate that the Syrians are just having their a**** handed back to them by an international force of jihadists amply supplied by Turkey and supported with judicious aerial attacks by Israel, and that the Palestinians are slowly but surely being exterminated without reprieve. As for Iran, it definitely does not want to be involved in a full-fledged war. The only ones possibly crazy enough to continue engaging in military operations are the Yemenis — but for how long if nobody else does? Their supplies of missiles and drones are not inexhaustible. Things are therefore not looking good at all for the Near-Eastern enemies of Israel and the USA. Thus, Israel has a not negligible probability to secure a victory — costly, prohibitively so perhaps, pyrrhic even, but a victory nevertheless.

How Yemen Became a Rising Power in West Asia? A Conversation with Fadi Kafeety https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeIR2TIHljU has anyone else heard anything about that? If the ceasefire holds it will be a victory for Israel – That may be true but, anyone, or, group, being successful in genocide and massive human rights violations – that’s not something, in my mind, to be victorious or successful about. Assuredly the dimension of time will prove it short term and disastrous – but hey, why speculate about the future and it’s outcome when the now is the deal. What risks being utterly disastrous in my mind is a world in which genocide becomes normalised and international law is dead. If Israel and the US axis get away with it, that’s what we’ll get. Harris losing was a small victory but this is the main risk for our future as a species. E.U. Vessels Surround Anchored Chinese Ship After Cables Are Severed in Baltic Sea New York Times (Kevin W). How is this detention not an illegal seizure, aka piracy, or at least illegal interference? Because they have a letter of marque. A Freedom of Anchoring exercise? Not a Coastie, but there are various authorities for boarding. See in particular Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation Numb in India, part 7: Land of gloop Sam Kriss. Trust me, worth a read. A lovely read and thanks for the reminder of how good a writer Sam Kriss can be. I used to be a regular reader and somehow he fell out of my regular subscriptions (too many good things out there to keep up with). Not many westerner writers travelling in Asia provide genuinely new insights, but he is one of them. I’ve never been to Kerala, I just know of it from the lovely patient Keralan nurses who cared for my parents in years past. It has long been recognised as one of the best run Indian States, although the competition isn’t all that high. Its also a good reminder of the incredible diversity of India – there are plenty of chunks of that country as big as many other countries which are very different in culture and politics from what we usually think of as ‘India’ – the many cultures of the Himalayan foothills and plateaus as one example. There are also a surprising number of hot wars going on at any one time in the sub-continent, usually entirely unreported, even in India. The question of why India seems to have faltered while China surges is one that seems to be consuming both Indians and Chinese these days – my Chinese media feeds are full of mocking commentary on India. Some Indians seem quietly confident their country is at the beginning of a renaissance, others have their exit plans well prepared. I guess it all depends on what you think of Modi. Assuming climate change doesn’t make the sub-continent uninhabitable, its not too late, there are plenty of models in Asia for late take-offs economically – Vietnam and Indonesia in particular seem to have hit that acceleration stage and both had similar problems to India. India has its success stories. It has some of the biggest companies in the world, a vast amount of domestic talent, nuclear weapons, hypersonic missiles, and satellites. As well as…. all the other things we know about. But sometime around the mid 1990’s it started to fall very far behind its most obvious peer nation, in terms of raw GNP, human development and in tech. Many a book and article has been written on the topic, you can pretty much pick your theory as to why India has fallen behind according to your particular prejudice. Too much capitalism, too little capitalism, too big a state, too weak a state, colonialism, the wrong type of colonialism, cultural diversity, lack of it, the caste system, paternalistic family companies, laziness (the latter often opined by upper caste Indians), and so on. I’m something of an geographic determinist. Big continental or island States that succeed economically tend to have certain things in common – big navigable rivers or inland seas connecting natural harbours, easy to access mineral riches, good soils. India lacks many of these – it has few natural harbours, its rivers are not suitable for much transport and with some localised exceptions its soils are generally poor and unproductive without intensive labour inputs. It has plenty of coal and other minerals, but it is generally low quality and difficult to access and refine. The difficult topography of inland India always seemed to lead to lots of little feudal states historically, which proved easy for outside conquerors, with plenty of those from north of the Himalaya preceding the British. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_of_Small_Things The God of Small Things, a Booker award winner takes place in Kerala. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_We_Imagine_as_Light All We Imagine as Light, a Cannes award winner, follows to Kerala nurses trying to make it in Mumbai. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism_in_India Kerala is the only surviving communist state in India.

There is no single tragedy at the heart of Arundhati Roy’s devastating first novel. Although ”The God of Small Things” opens with memories of a family grieving around a drowned child’s coffin, there are plenty of other intimate horrors still to come, and they compete for the reader’s sympathy with the furious energy of cats in a sack. Yet the quality of Ms. Roy’s narration is so extraordinary — at once so morally strenuous and so imaginatively supple — that the reader remains enthralled all the way through to its agonizing finish. This ambitious meditation on the decline and fall of an Indian family is part political fable, part psychological drama, part fairy tale, and it begins at its chronological end, in a landscape of extravagant ruin. When 31-year-old Rahel Kochamma returns to Ayemenem House, her former home in the south Indian state of Kerala, its elegant windows are coated with filth and its brass doorknobs dulled with grease; dead insects lie in the bottom of its empty vases. The only animated presence in the house seems to be great-aunt Baby Kochamma’s new television set — in front of which she and her servant sit day after day, munching peanuts. Rahel has come back to Ayemenem not to see her great-aunt, however, but because she has heard that her twin brother, Estha, has unexpectedly returned. Estha and Rahel were once inseparable, but now they have been apart for almost 25 years — ever since the winter of 1969, when their English cousin, Sophie Mol, drowned in the river with their grandmother’s silver thimble in her fist. ”Perhaps it’s true that things can change in a day,” Ms. Roy’s narrator muses. ”That a few dozen hours can affect the outcome of whole lifetimes. And that when they do, those few dozen hours, like the salvaged remains of a burned house — the charred clock, the singed photograph, the scorched furniture — must be resurrected from the ruins and examined. Preserved. Accounted for.” And this is precisely Ms. Roy’s undertaking as, throughout her book, she shuttles between the twins’ past and present, continually angling in, crabwise, toward the night of Sophie Mol’s death…. https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/03/books/melodrama-as-structure-for-subtlety.html June 3, 1997 Melodrama as Structure for Subtlety By MICHIKO KAKUTANI THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS By Arundhati Roy ”The God of Small Things,” Arundhati Roy’s dazzling first novel, begins as a sort of mystery story. What caused the boy named Estha to stop talking? What sent his twin sister, Rahel, into exile in the United States? Why did their beautiful mother, Ammu, end up dying alone in a grimy hotel room? What killed their English cousin, Sophie Mol? And why has a ”whiff of scandal” involving sex and death come to surround their bourgeois family? While such questions may sound crudely melodramatic, they provide the narrative architecture of a novel that turns out to be as subtle as it is powerful, a novel that is Faulknerian in its ambitious tackling of family and race and class, Dickensian in its sharp-eyed observation of society and character… A millennia-long tradition of organized martial arts may have helped them retain their cultural and economic identity. Kalaripayattu. Kerala is the most lovely part of India imho. I’ve been going to India on holiday almost every year for 20 years or so, because I love it so much. Last year I decided to fly up to Ahmedabad on my way home to spend a few days. I can’t really recommend it. Only place I’ve been where the Hindutva vibe was too much to take. Good thali though and the Gandhi ashram was worth the hour it took to visit. But Kerala is fab. The ayurvedic treatment you can get there is very reasonably priced and they are not dogmatic or trying to convert you to some new lifestyle but rather help you to get better. Kochi is a lovely little city and Thiruvanathpuram (Trivandrum) is a sort of quirky state capital with a giant wooden maharajah’s palace next to a huge temple and very walkable. But the best part is just to get out to the backwaters and eat a Keralan fish curry, washed down with coconut toddy… My mind makes an association between Sam Kriss’ gloop and Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop. You’re welcome. Re: ‘organ damage’ As a cardiologist with Long Covid and a fan of this blog permit me to say that it’s impossible to know what to make of the “mild atrial irregularity” without knowing the age of the patient or the nature of the “irregularity”. Millions of people had mild atrial issues long before COVID — and it correlates with age and various other items like hypertension, alcohol consumption patterns, etc. Atrial arrhythmia is one of the most overdiagnosed and overtreated cardiac ‘conditions’, and a source of much business for the electrophysiology labs that have sprouted up all over the country in the last 20 years. That said, since so much of the phenotype of Long Covid runs parallel with aging in general, it wouldn’t surprise me if an increase in atrial issues were one of the post-acute things we see. Still, I wouldn’t put it high on the list of things those of us with Long Covid need to fret about.

Ultimate Irony Comes as Taliban Asks Russia’s Help To Evade US Sanctions, Closing 50-year Loop of Violence Antiwar.com (Kevin W) The US had spent billions arming freedom fighters to fight the Russians out of Afghanistan, … No it didn’t. US had intentionaly spent gazillions arming extremists of all sorts all around the world, knowing very well what they are, and rebranding them as freedom fighters in order to sell the lie to idi*ts. If the Russians manage to bring Afghanistan in from the cold like they are doing for North Korea, then maybe that country can develop all those mineral reserves that the Pentagon tried to use to justify the occupation and rebuild their country.

But in that interview the man clearly declared that had they (mujahideen) known what would follow for Afghanistan, they certainly would have not fought “the shuravi”. I guess Taliban learned from all those mistakes. Andrew Korybko has an interesting take on Russia’s strategy re Afghanistan. The Kremlin is playing the long game, as usual. https://asiatimes.com/2024/11/russias-grand-geo-economic-plan-a-step-closer-in-afghanistan/ “Russian Ruble Collapses As Putin’s Economy in Trouble” I think that Newsweek are getting their hopes up. I don’t think that the sanctions are causing the inflation in Russia so much as the Russian economy is overheating due to it’s expansion as a wartime economy. A shortage of workers is not helping things either. Inside Russia the ruble is not a problem as that is what the workers are getting paid in so if Newsweek is hoping, like Biden, that the ruble will become rubble they may have to wait a while. Just wait until these Russian collapse stories meet the China collapse stories and have babies together. Maybe with some “at what cost” polycule added in. The data other than an artificial currency value are fine. While what matters is currency support from China, which is there along with general economic support. China is by far the largest world economy and open and inviting to Russian exchange. Russians as a number of other peoples can come and go in China with no visas and Hainan could not be a better winter refuge; even a free port refuge. Russia has made China more than energy self-sufficient, and the Russian and Chinese economies are complementary in important ways beyond energy. https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2024/October/weo-report?c=223,924,132,134,532,534,536,158,546,922,112,111,&s=PPPGDP,PPPSH,&sy=2000&ey=2023&ssm=0&scsm=1&scc=0&ssd=1&ssc=0&sic=0&sort=country&ds=.&br=1 October 15, 2024 Gross Domestic Product based on purchasing-power-parity (PPP) for Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, United Kingdom and United States, 2000-2023 2023 China ( 33,552) United States ( 27,721) India ( 14,620) Russia ( 6,512) Japan ( 6,398) Germany ( 5,876) Brazil ( 4,457) Indonesia ( 4,335) France ( 4,211) United Kingdom ( 4,137) With a weak Ruble, Russian gas exports will be even cheaper in comparison to what the suckers EU will pay for strong-dollar US LNG. The ruble-Euro exchange rate on 23.02.2022 was 90.88, today it is 114.31; this is not a particularly significant change after nearly three years, especially in light of all the fireworks that have taken place. RWA’s summary is interesting. I would add one more thing, based on my 20+ years of experience importing into Russia. Every year without fail, as the new year approached, the ruble would depreciate vs the $ and Euro. Always. This drove our accountants crazy, as it made it more expensive for us to buy $/Euro (usually Euro) to pay our EU suppliers before the end of the year, and because we were pricing in Euro (though selling in rubles) it also drove up our ruble profits (i.e., more income taxes to pay). And every year, after the holidays ended after 15 January, the ruble would appreciate (usually back to its previous level). Then as now, two factors were at play: higher seasonal demand for $/Euro (Russians preparing to vacation abroad, retailers buying imported products for the holiday shopping season, trading companies settling their foreign accounts payable before the close of the year), and the Russian government gently leaning on the scales to weaken the ruble (in order to boost corporate income tax revenues across the board, a nice holiday gift for the upcoming year’s budget). I think there is nothing new under the sun. Let’s see what the exchange rates look like at the end of January 2025 before jumping to conclusions. Since January 2000, the real exchange value of Russian currency has increased by 55.7%: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=mvBn January 15, 2018 Real Broad Effective Exchange Rate for Russia, 2000-2024 (Indexed to 2000) I don’t see why Russians should be too concerned about currency fluctuations. Free floating currencies bounce all over the place for a variety of reasons. Over the last 25 years the Canadian dollar has swung from 68 cents US to 1.10 $ US and back down again. It doesn’t make much difference at the retail level for consumers but has caused serious problems for exporters when the CAD was high. Many factories have closed as a result. I should add Canada is a net energy exporter, as is Russia. For a net importer a low currency could cause serious problems.

What was, now is. : Taleb: Never use terms such as progressive or conservative without reference to a rate of change Progressive and conservative are ill defined terms, verbalistic labels. It is required to specify a rate of change for every specific domain. Rationally progressive means embracing progress by accepting a certain rate of change deemed optimal. Too high a rate of change cancels the gains from previous mutations; while too slow a change leads to misfitness. : Pandit, Pradhan, & van Schaik: Figure 6 shows the number of feasible classes as a function of the skew in power, σ, and the original group size, N(0). … the number of feasible classes has a very weak dependence on group size. Thus, for the N(0) in the typical range of human group sizes, the number of classes only depends on σ. Intriguingly, at lower σ we expect to find more classes… The size of the upper class is largest for σ → 0 (~ half of the group), thus potentially leading to a large number of middle classes. Power. That’s a word Fazi doesn’t hone in on. Rather applicable to the tremendous wealth inequality of an oligarchy. Thanks.

Vessels Surround Anchored Chinese Ship After Cables Are Severed in Baltic Sea New York Times (Kevin W). How is this detention not an illegal seizure, aka piracy, or at least illegal interference? From the article” “But U.S. intelligence officials have assessed that the cables were not cut deliberately” It not something I’m up to date on, but international law on undersea cables is mostly based on the Paris Convention of 1888 (yes, thats right, 1888). In simple terms, there is an obligation on ships not do do anything that could break a cable, and its up to national governments to enforce the law on vessels registered in its country. Military ships do have the right under Article X to board a ship suspected of having broken a cable so even if the breaking was accidental, stopping and checking the Chinese ship would be lawful under the law of the sea. This Atlantic Council (booo!) article says otherwise-stating your aforementioned treaty doesn’t provide guarantees and protections for undersea cables. https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/hybrid-warfare-project/international-law-doesnt-adequately-protect-undersea-cables-that-must-change/ They are not really contradictory. The right to check a vessel under any flag that is suspected of causing damage is established in Article X, but its always been ambiguous about what rights and obligations apply after the stop occurs, especially if a State actor is suspected to be involved in the damage or the ‘home’ country of the vessel involved refuses to co-operate. There has also been questions raised about other types of cable, specifically transnational electric cables, as they are not explicitly covered by the convention. High profile stops are rare, but on a more local scale in seas like the Irish Sea or Dogger Bank, stop and checks in international waters by military vessels of fishing boats suspected of dredging too near to cables happens all the time (fishermen regularly complain about this) – it doesn’t matter where the fishing boat is registered, its a well established right. It just gets ambiguous when you are dealing with contested areas as in the South China Sea or if the suspect is a military vessel -, that’s what the article is about. Re: British Parliament votes on euthanasia: I immediately thought “well they’ve mined “1984” for all it’s worth and are turning to a US novel, “Make Room Make Room”upon which the movie “Soylent Green” was based.

Any thoughts on the idea of a western sourced false flag operation in an allied state? The London camera thing is weird but no where near convincing. And would London even be the best target? Is there a euro state where the people aren’t fully on board with project Ukraine and a massive event would act to pull the West together? Perhaps blowing up the Hague would accomplish multiple things at the same time? First, because of the UK’s role in NATO’s war on Russia, London will be one of Russia’s three most obvious targets, two of which are in the UK, amongst all the possible targets throughout the Collective West; second, the British security services are best placed and most motivated to organise a false flag; third, the UK’s Parliament and population are incredibly gullible (note the ease with which the ridiculous explanation of the Skripal affair has been accepted); and fourth, it was planned before the Oresnik strike when the various intelligence services still thought that the public would accept that Russia would use a nuke. The problem the West has now is that Russia could take out ALL the decision-making centres (and population centres) in Europe without nukes and the only possible source of effective (that is, nuclear) retaliation would be the US, and that would be disastrous for the US, so the US would consider Article 5, as it is obliged to do, and say “No thanks, old buddies. The war against Russia is now strictly a European affair”. There was a pamphlet about the decline of the UK published by Encounter magazine, a CIA front, in the fifties entitled, as I remember, “Suicide of a Nation” (God knows where it is among my shelves). The title was, of course, metaphorical. The question now is whether the Brits are prepared to play a game of Russian roulette with all chambers loaded. Unfortunately, the answer will most likely be that the ideologically driven incompetents who’ve been running this war beyond the reach of sanity will say, “Yes, please. I’ll go first, so pass me the gun”. I have to admit that I did not understand how virulently various interests in the UK hated the Russians. I’ve been amazed to watch my UK friends post meme after meme describing how awful the Russians are and how we should just annihilate them all. It makes me think that western leaders will only be happy when Gaza is full of ghosts and Russia is a graveyard. I seem to have missed some crucial Britishness classes because I have never felt this way. And I really don’t see where my compatriots have got this from. However, I did have a New Year’s party in Dec 2022 which nearly ruined a thirty year friendship group when it turned out that two of us (me + gold trader) took Russia’s side and two of us (particle physics professor and healthcare informatics / pandemic data analysis PhD) took the Ukraine’s. We were shocked by their fact-free convictions. We have agreed not to speak of it again! Actually, if you do a YT search about the CCD cameras in London; you’ll find many videos stating that they have been off-line for the past 85 days or more, not just 24 hours. There’s been no official explanation as to why, but then again, what reporter nowadays would dare to ask the question? I say, “off-line” because the theory is that they’re still working, just no longer accessible to the public (nor to the regular police either, for some reason). Commenters on these videos have stated that a similar thing has happened in Manchester, and I believe Bristol. Apparently, MI-5/6 has form on this because the CCD cameras around London were supposedly not operating on the day of 7/7 either. I’m just repeating what the YTubers have been saying on this last bit, but they’re all pretty insistent on this. Who knows what the truth is anymore? For anyone who wants to have some real fun; do a YT search about those drones that have been showing up at UK airports. The false flag theory is plausible but if the goal is all-out war with Russia, western war planners once again fail to take everything into account. I, an average guy living an average life, know for near certain that a co-ordinated allied attack on Russia would be met with a similar mobilisation from China. It’s just obvious that China’s best interests are Russia not falling into western hands and getting used in turn to isolate China. This looks like it’s going to be a case of dog catching car. https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/29/world/europe/uk-assisted-dying-bill-vote.html November 29, 2024 After Emotional Debate, British Lawmakers Vote to Legalize Assisted Dying In a landmark decision on Friday, Parliament voted in favor of allowing assisted suicide for some terminally ill people under strict conditions.

A Bird Flu Pandemic Would Be One of the Most Foreseeable Catastrophes in History – Zeynep Tufekci And it is not paywalled, either, which is extremely rare at NY Times. Rest assured, after H5N1 hits, she’ll be minimizing yet another Pandemic, if it turns out people don’t turn blue and explode. None the less, clearly some subset of the elite are rightly freaking out. Just a few weeks ago, a pig in a backyard farm in Oregon was found to have bird flu. It seems to have gotten it from sick poultry on the same farm. Pigs cause extra worry because they are considered to be ideal mixing vessels for various animal flu viruses to adapt and spread among humans. Last week, the virus was found in a flock of ducks at a pet fair in Hawaii, the one state that hadn’t previously found a case — likely transmitted by wild birds, which continue to spread the illness far and wide. Of the 34 individuals who had been exposed at that pet fair, including 13 who had respiratory symptoms, all were offered voluntary testing. Five declined. A teenager in Canada was infected, and the virus showed some key mutations that bring it closer to adapting to spread among humans. This outbreak has so far been mostly mild in humans, but historically it has been deadly, and further mutations could make it so again. That Canadian is in critical condition, unable to breathe independently. There’s also an infected child in California who was not known to have come into contact with any sick animals at all, which raises the terrifying possibility that he got it from another human being. And the virus levels in the wastewater in several states keep spiking. We’ve definitely arrived at the bucket-up phase of this.

According to the ministry, on November 28, the Russian Armed Forces launched a comprehensive attack on defense and industrial facilities, as well as the energy infrastructure of Ukraine. In addition, on November 25 and 26, Iskander ballistic missiles destroyed ATACMS launchers, installations with experimental samples of Grom-2 missiles, as well as a transport and loading vehicle of the Neptune anti-ship complex. In addition, during the attack, Russian missiles landed directly at the headquarters of the Main Intelligence Directorate “Kraken” in Kharkov. As a result of the strike, up to 40 foreign specialists were eliminated, most of whom were specialists from the United States. From A strange new climate era is beginning to take hold It will be those investments — and the energy choices of up-and-coming developing nations — that will determine the future of the planet. So WaPo basically blames developing nations, Trump tariffs, AI, whatever, the blame directed everywhere except at the capitalist class itself. No, the solution to climate is to terminate capitalism. Instead we’re all gonna burn alive. Without a serious discussion of what all of this energy usage is in service of, and what people really need to live a decent life, there won’t be any worthwhile progress on avoiding an extinction level event. Good stuff. As much as I like the the idea of Putin as Cobra Commander holding the West hostage, it makes about as much sense as the more hyperbolic claims about the Oreshnik. We already have decades of research and experimental data on fairly similar cases: 1) On the low end, large sabot penetrators (tungsten or depleted uranium): 10kg at Mach 5-6 2) On the high end, HEAT warhead penetrators (copper): 1kg at Mach 15-25 Neither of these cause destruction by mystical waves of pressure or heat. The damage is purely kinetic: direct impact and spalled fragments of whatever they hit. A 100kg* penetrator travelling at Mach 10 will cause proportionately scaled damage–but it is not remotely comparable to a nuclear weapon. At least, that seems like the safest assumption unless we see dramatic evidence to the contrary. * The throw weight of a Bulava at max range is 1,000 kg bus and warheads, but let’s be generous and assume something with more weight and less range. (This was meant as a reply to AG’s GI Joe clip, but it looks like I missed it). Since you mention COBRA – your post could either be about Covid OR Oreshnik. p.s. Did Putin not state that several Oreshniks could cause as much destruction as a tactical nuke? If so I don´t know what value of a nuke´s powers he was referring to. Fission is a different beast altogether. But with conventional destructive capabalities added? Yes, that’s right. Let’s do some rough math (hopefully correctly) and see where this might be coming from: A small nuke = a kiloton of TNT = 4.2E12 joules A 100kg* penetrator traveling at Mach 10 = 5.9E8 36 penetrators in an Oreshnik = 2.1E10 100 Oreshniks (or just 10 Oreshniks if it is a big missile) = 2.1E12 It seems that Putin is doing a sleight of hand that several others have done to impress the folks at home. You add up the joules of energy from a vast number of penetrators with such and such weight and velocity and eventually you get an impressive number. But it doesn’t add up to quite as much practical destructive force as the number implies. And even then, Putin must have been using numbers from a small tactical nuke. * 100kg is just a guess. If the missile is small, they couldn’t be much heavier, but a big short ranged missile could carry 10x more weight. What do you want to destroy? Counter force or counter value? Critical issue is accuracy of penetrators. If you have 18 hard targets (assign 2 “penetrators” to each) spread around the area of Hiroshima, you can achieve results equal to a 20 kt bombs. Would as air burst have gotten deep vaults? Jeffrey Lewis on TWITTER tried to ridicule the Oreshnik a bit by describing that buildings that were not targeted but were next to where the factotry was located had suffered cracks. Thus it was a bad weapon and the claims of accuracy fraudulent. I don´t understand these people. Why do scientists have to act like propagandists. It reminds of the German nuclear phyisicists when they were interned in Farm Hall in 1945 and were mocking US and others as not able to pull off a nuke before August 6th shell-shocked them… Kinetic penetrators were never about sheer energy, but about focusing it in a small area. They can get much deeper than surface explosion can. Comparing just energies of different projectile types is like comparing just GDPs of countries. Here’s a math problem. How big would a surface detonation have to be, in order to destroy underground bunker that one Oreshnik kinetic penetrator can? re: Project Zeus Did Zeus eat hazelnuts? I don´t think so. They are not your typical Greek flora, or are they? Most of the calculations I’ve seen compare the energy delivered by the mach 10 mass to that of kilotons of TNT, like nukes. Putin claimed that the temperature of the mass was 4000° which is above the melting point of most metals, and the plasma envelope around it was evident. That added thermal energy, and the dynamics of a plasma shielded molten blob might lead to some interesting effects not obvious from more mundane experiments. I agree with you that this is more than it seems. It is only a closed system in a vacuum. Passing through the atmosphere the air resistance creates the friction that generates this heat. That is likely adding to the net effect of the explosion but not figured into the equation. Metallurgists know about the molecular changes that take place above critical temperatures making some stainless steels magnetic and some non-magnetic. When tool steels (normally cubic-centered structures) reach critical temperatures they become austenitic (face-centered cubic grain structure) and lose their magnetism. Unknown changes are probably generated by this heat to the unknown substance of these rods, but it has been tested in Russia. Deferring to people who have practical experience in this is not magical thinking but pragmatic. I have seen several suggestions that the process at the end is magnetohydrodynamics, no official word yet. The scientist in charge is saying that currently they operate at 2,200deg. centigrade but theory lets them hope to get it up to 3,000 deg centigrade. i.e. Mach 15 @ Wisker. About the only realistic assessment I’ve read here. One has only to look at the published pictures of the above ground buildings at Yukhmash to see the sturdy Soviet era buildings have hardly “turned to dust”. Some caught fire from the white hot heat of passing projectiles. Subsequent descriptions of clusters of projectile holes in the ground where they missed a building have turned up. Nobody seems to have dug down to have a look at the “destruction” below. Hardly worth the bother. But, the general belief here is that somehow the projectiles from Oreshnik have kiloton nuclear bomb power. I’ll repeat again for the more dense folks here who seem to believe in magic: The final energy of the rod projectiles cannot exceed that of the chemical energy released by the missile’s rocket motors. Period. It is a closed system and the Law of Conservation of Energy applies. If 40 tonnes of rocket fuel, expended all at once, like in blowing up on the launch pad, is equivalent to several kilotons of TNT, I’m a monkey’s uncle. But if fairy tales make you happy, so be it. And the same goes for Putin. The advantage of Oreshnik is the super fast delivery time of an actual nuke on target from a mobile launcher. Now that indeed is a concern for Western “strategists” who might be awake. If indeed, any competent ones are on the job who are not beholden to the party line like MSM journalists who are unconsciously adept at writing “stuff” that pleases their overlords. And no, I am not making shit up. Others are. I don’t know where people are getting kilotons out of this weapon. I’ve seen, and my own crude calculations produce, multi-ton-level per 75-100kg munition, with that energy focused in a cone along the direction of travel like a large hammer blow. The highest I’ve seen is 11 tons per munition, and I suspect that’s too big, although the Ukrainians estimated velocity at 11.0 to 11.4 km/s, a lot higher than other reports, and energy is velocity squared. Assuming no more than 10 tons tnt equivalent/munition, that’s less than 360 tons tnt per device. That’s still a lot. What’s even more interesting is how tight the sheaf of the impact appears to be. If that’s the case, this weapon is incredibly precise (if not accurate) especially for its velocity. Whatever is below the impact points is going to be crushed. Explosives used in that tight of a sheaf impacting within a second of each other might cause less damage due to interference, whether that be due to phase cancellation or blowing up the following warheads or other factors. This is an interesting weapon system for sure, but probably not even close to kiloton yield even in aggregate. That’s still enough to utterly destroy something on the receiving end, and do so efficiently. Your point is valid and I am sceptical of these claims but should we also consider something like “energy flux”, i.e. the impact is vertical and focused in a narrow cone around the falling projectile, rather than a spherical explosion, increasing the damage in a directional way? If it is focused in a cone with 1/10th the radius of a spherical explosion, the “flux” is ~ 100x greater (I am modelling it as a passing through a flat circle rather than a small spherical surface). Michael von der Schulenburg with acid comment on EU in BERLINER ZEITUNG: Ukraine War: New EU Resolution Brings Europe to the Brink of World War III https://archive.is/wwzU3 Finale: This resolution is a document full of hatred, panic and hysteria – a shameful expression of irresponsibility and a lack of empathy for the many victims of such war hysteria. There is nothing in it for us Europeans to be proud of. Fortunately, this resolution is unlikely to have any direct political impact on the war in Ukraine. The European Parliament has simply demonstrated once again that it behaves like a “dummy decision-maker” on many issues – in this case, fortunately for all of us. For me, who has always been an ardent supporter of the European idea, it is painful to listen to the debates of a war-mongering and hate-filled parliamentary majority. I then ask myself: what kind of monster have we created with the EU? I believe this is the full text of the resolution: JOINT MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION on reinforcing EU’s unwavering support to Ukraine against Russia’s war of aggression and the increasing military cooperation between North Korea and Russia This is just an embarrassing display of political, economic and social delusion and, as mi mam used to say, “Fine words don’t butter no parsnips”. But stupidity can elicit a tree full of hazelnuts. Good multi language pun! It is a monster which will either remain subservient to the US, or will gradually implode and it’s members will part company with each other, or both; or it could simply recognise reality and either implode or remains in some form as abstract in it’s realty as it’s model, the Holy Roman Empire, accepting that it is the inferior in terms of it’s relationships with Russia and China – on whom it is dependent if it’s inhabitants are to enjoy a standard of living anywhere approaching the standard they enjoy today which, of course, for most people means a standard lower than that of 2021. Just started reading that wonderful post about Kerala. A thing about it that kind of lights me up a bit, and I think may not be mentioned in the piece itself, is it’s proximity to the upcoming north/south transport corridor that will bypass Suez and go all the way to Russia, IIRC. The port of Chabahar in Iran is where it will start. This looks set to be an interesting corner of the world as the near future unfolds. I’m looking forward to watching how things develop.

"The U.S market will continue to do well. As you know, tech has already done well. So, what I would do is focus on companies and industries that are taking advantage of technology to improve productivity," the chairman of the Mobius Emerging Opportunities Fund said in an interview with CNBC last week. U.S.-based companies geared toward China and India, as well as other major emerging market economies, are well positioned, he added. "I focus on those companies that are global in their scope, and producing and exporting and selling in these countries, because that's where the growth will be." Investors should also consider firms taking advantage of what Mobius calls "accelerated information," such as chip manufacturers. "I call AI accelerated information because there's nothing artificial about AI and it's not intelligent. But it's getting more information faster and being able to analyze that information much more effectively," he said. His comments come as emerging markets that produce semiconductors enjoy an economic boom, with Taiwan — which makes most of the advanced chips in circulation — a particular success story. ASEAN countries in Southeast Asia are also enjoying increased foreign investment. Malaysia's focus on chip production, for instance, has seen it become deeply embedded into the global supply chain. Speaking with CNBC at the October IMF annual meetings in Washington, D.C., Malaysia's central bank governor Abdul Rasheed Ghaffour said the country exports 7% of the world's semiconductors. Mobius says there's "no question" that a tech bubble is on the horizon given the valuations of the so-called Magnificent Seven — a group of Big Tech stocks comprising of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. But although he admitted that some of stock prices had "gone up too fast and too far," he's not concerned. "You must remember that you can't just look at the price-to-earnings ratio, which is the normal measure that people use to evaluate whether an industry or a stock is too expensive, because the growth rate of these companies is so great," he said. Nvidia has been the primary beneficiary of the ongoing artificial intelligence boom, with its next-generation AI chip Blackwell now in focus. Shares of the company have nearly tripled so far in 2024 — up more than 170% in the year-to-date — making it the world's most valuable publicly traded company. Some investors worry the AI juggernaut won't be able to keep up the rapid growth, however, although Mobius remains optimistic about the prospects for Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks. "The [Magnificent Seven] earnings are growing at a terrific pace and you've got to look forward that will continue. I'm not so concerned about most of these companies being too expensive, they will continue to do quite well," Mobius added.

Title: The Bambu Lab A1 Mini Changed My Opinion About 3D Printing
URL: https://www.maketecheasier.com/review/bambu-lab-a1-mini/
Time Published: 2024-11-29T01:25:00Z
Full Content:
Sign up for our daily newsletter I’ve watched way too many friends wrestle with 3D printers – endless calibration processes and hours of print settings tweaking just to get a half-decent result. It all seemed like way more trouble than it was worth, and for years, that kept me from even considering buying one myself. But then I discovered the Bambu Lab A1 Mini, and everything changed. When I spotted the Bambu Lab A1 Mini on sale for $200, my interest was immediately piqued by the promise of a plug-and-print experience with high-quality output right out of the box. This hassle-free experience is made possible by a suite of intelligent features that eliminate the typical frustrations of 3D printing. The entire calibration process is fully automated thanks to a network of sensors: it measures the bed level, sets the perfect Z-offset, calibrates the belt tension, and even fine-tunes the vibration compensation before each print. There’s also the Active Flow Rate Compensation system, which actively measures and adjusts the pressure in the nozzle as it prints to eliminate common headaches like blobby corners or inconsistent layers. The compact size was another selling point. At just 347 x 315 x 365 mm, the Bambu Lab A1 Mini has almost exactly the right size for my modest desk setup. Sure, its 180 x 180 x 180 mm build volume isn’t the largest out there, but it’s more than adequate for most of my home printing needs. It’s worth noting that the Bambu Lab also offers an optional A1 Mini-compatible AMS (Automatic Material System) for multi-color printing, but I decided to skip it. As cool as multi-color prints look, the process requires frequent purging of filament when switching colors, which creates a lot of waste. Since my needs for multi-color prints are pretty limited, I couldn’t justify the extra cost and material waste. Convinced that the A1 Mini is worth the price, I placed my order through Bambu Lab’s European store on a Wednesday evening. After a week that felt much longer than usual – thanks to my growing excitement and endless YouTube reviews – a box arrived at my doorstep, and I was ready to unbox my new printer. The A1 Mini came pre-assembled – a welcome departure from the DIY kits I’d watched friends struggle with – and the setup process was refreshingly straightforward. After placing the printer on my desk and removing a few pieces of protective foam, I just needed to attach the spool holder and plug it in. The touchscreen interface walked me through each step with clear instructions that actually made sense. Loading the included sample filament was equally intuitive. The printer guided me through the process on its 2.4-inch touchscreen: insert the filament until the sensor detects it, then tap “Load.” The printer handled everything else automatically, heating up the nozzle and feeding the filament through. When plastic emerged from the nozzle, I knew I was ready to print. Then came the moment of truth: my first Benchy, the little 3D printed tugboat that serves as a standard test print across the 3D printing community. The printer confidently ran through its pre-print calibration routine, checking everything from bed level to belt tension. Then it started printing at a speed that made me nervous – until I saw the results. About 20 minutes later (this includes the time it took the printer to complete its calibration routines), I was holding a nearly perfect Benchy. The layers were clean, the overhangs were smooth, and even the tiny details like the door arch and window frames came out crisp. No stringing, no layer shifts, and no elephant’s foot at the base. Like most major manufacturers of 3D printers, Bambu providers its own slicer software, called Bambu Studio. Those familiar with PrusaSlicer will find Bambu Studio to be instantly familiar, and for a good reason: it’s a direct fork. Indeed, Bambu Lab has taken the well-loved PrusaSlicer framework and enhanced it with features tailored specifically for their printers, such as seamless integration with the AMS system for multi-material printing and optimized profiles for high-speed, high-quality results. Bambu Lab’s own slicer software impressed me from the start with its clean interface and intelligent default settings, but I soon discovered OrcaSlicer (a fork of Bambu Studio) after seeing it repeatedly recommended in online communities. While OrcaSlicer’s standout advantage is its superior compatibility with non-Bambu printers, I personally use it from time to time mainly because it supports some advance print settings that Bambu Studio doesn’t. For instance, I often find myself turning to OrcaSlicer specifically for its mouse ears brim feature – small circular additions to the brim that provide extra adhesion exactly where needed. Like many new 3D printer owners, I needed a practical project to justify the purchase to my skeptical spouse, and our Ikea sofa provided one. You see, it’s low-profile legs created a black hole for toys – anything that rolled under it was effectively lost until our next major furniture-moving cleaning session. This was my chance. Using TinkerCAD (a free, browser-based 3D modeling tool), I designed a set of sleeve-like adapters that could slide over the sofa’s legs while providing mounting points for a wooden barrier. The print took a few hours using Bambu’s black PLA filament, and the results exceeded my expectations. The adapters fit perfectly, and now our living room floor stays toy-free. Encouraged by this success, I started looking for other household challenges to tackle. A broken dishwasher soap dispenser clip? Printed a replacement in 30 minutes. Our oddly-sized shower drain that no standard plug would fit? Designed and printed a custom solution that works better than anything we could have bought. But I have to admit, while practical projects justified the purchase, toys for my kids make up the bulk of my printing these days. This is where Bambu Lab’s MakerWorld website has become an invaluable resource. It’s a community platform that hosts thousands of 3D models, many with pre-configured print profiles specifically optimized for the A1 Mini. My kids have been particularly delighted with the custom Duplo-compatible bricks I’ve printed. The adapters that let them connect their Duplo blocks to wooden Brio train tracks were an instant hit. We’ve also printed specialized pieces like a working crane tower, custom railway switches, and even a replica John Deere tractor in perfect Duplo scale. One of their favorites is a series of elevated train track pieces that let them build more complex railway layouts than what’s possible with standard Duplo tracks. Thanks to the pre-configured profiles on MakerWorld and the A1 Mini’s automated calibration, most prints succeed on the first try and look fantastic without any additional work required. I simply download a model, send it to the printer, and come back a few hours later to find exactly what I wanted. While the A1 Mini has been a remarkably reliable printer, I did encounter two minor issues that were easily solved with, ironically enough, 3D printing. The first quirk was somewhat messy: the printer would occasionally flick bits of purged filament (affectionately known as “filament poop” in the 3D printing community) onto the floor around the printer. A quick search on MakerWorld revealed dozens of community-designed solutions for this problem. I opted for the “Compact Poop Bucket” design, which catches these bits of waste filament neatly and can be easily emptied when full. The sheer number of different catch solutions available is actually quite amusing – whether you want something purely functional or a design that turns the waste collection into a decorative feature, you’ll find it in the community. The second issue was more annoying and potentially problematic. In its stock configuration, the A1 Mini’s filament guide moves up and down with the Z-axis. During calibration routines or tall prints, this movement sometimes caused the filament to slip off the spool or become tangled – not exactly what you want to discover halfway through a long print. Thankfully, another community-designed solution came to the rescue: a top-mounted Bowden guide that attaches to the top of the Z-axis tower. This keeps the filament path consistent regardless of the print head’s height, completely eliminating the tangling issues. I’ve also printed several quality-of-life improvements, like covers for the printer’s various ports and cable management clips. While none of these upgrades were strictly necessary, they’ve helped keep my setup tidy and protected. It’s somewhat meta that one of the best uses for a 3D printer is printing improvements for itself, but that’s part of what makes this hobby so engaging, especially if you take the time to learn a CAD software tool and gain the ability to create your own 3D models.

Title: Instead of AirPods, I'd recommend Meta Ray-Bans as the best tech deal of Black Friday 2024

Among the most popular tech products of 2024, the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses have been the surprise hit. Amazon is offering the version with the classic black frames for $239 (20% off the $299 retail price). This is an especially excellent deal when you consider that many styles of the Meta Ray-Bans were often out of stock for much of the first half of 2024 -- and the smart glasses have rarely been discounted. A lot of the appeal is the fact that they look just like normal Ray-Bans, and you can even replace the lenses with your own glasses prescription. Also: The best Cyber Monday deals: Live updates The caveat to keep in mind here is that Amazon sells eight different styles of the Meta Ray-Bans, and it's the classic black frames with green tinted lenses that are on sale for the lowest price. Other styles cost $30 to $80 more. For example, if you want to wear these smart glasses both inside and outside, then you can get a pair with transition lenses. Those normally retail for $379, but Amazon is offering them 20% off, for $303. I tried the Meta Ray-Bans earlier this year and was much more impressed than I expected. First, to be clear, they are augmented reality glasses, but they're audio-only, so there's no screen overlaid on the lenses. All the feedback comes through the speakers that down-fire into your ears and are hidden in the arms of the glasses. Also: Why Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses are my favorite tech purchase this year I was also pleasantly surprised by the audio quality. For phone calls and conference calls and for listening to podcasts and audiobooks, the sound is nearly as bright and clear as a pair of AirPods or other quality earbuds. For listening to music, movies, or shows with lots of bass and surround sound effects, the Meta Ray-Bans are acceptable but not nearly as robust as a pair of high-end headphones from Apple, Sony, Bose, and others. And because of the open concept, naturally the Meta Ray-Bans can't offer the kind of noise cancellation that you get from AirPods Pro or the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds, for example. All in all, the sound of the Meta Ray-Bans is similar to what you get from the AirPods Pro in transparency mode. But, the Meta Ray-Bans can also do things that no headphones can do. They have a built-in 12-megapixel ultrawide camera for taking photos and capturing videos. This camera is about the same quality as an iPhone 12 or a Samsung Galaxy S20. It only takes photos and videos in portrait mode, but it's far faster to tap the button on top of the right arm of the glasses than it is to pull your camera out of your pocket. The Meta Ray-Bans also have a built-in AI assistant that you can trigger by saying "Hey Meta," and use the large language models that Meta has been furiously building over the past several years. For basic information searches, it works well and is another nice option for leaving your phone in your pocket. The battery life is about a half-day with moderate use, but you can quickly charge to about 50% with 20 minutes in the included case. The case itself charges via standard USB-C, which is nice. You can nearly double the battery by turning off the "Hey Meta" listening feature -- which I did. Meta also regularly rolls out software updates that bring new functionality to the Meta Ray-Bans. For example, during 2024 the Meta Ray-Bans added the capability of translating from Spanish to English in real time and the ability to do a visual search to identify landmarks or translate street signs. And Meta says it will continue to add new features such as helping you remember things you've seen, like your parking spot. Also: The best Apple deals for Cyber Monday 2024 If you're concerned about the way Meta handles privacy -- as many of us are -- the good thing about the Meta Ray-Bans is that they don't require a Facebook account. While they do require a Meta account, you can at least ostensibly keep them separate from your Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp data. That makes it easier for me to recommend the product from a privacy perspective. Don't get me wrong, the AirPods Pro 2 are available for a great deal at $153 ($97 off) for Black Friday and Cyber Monday. But the Meta Ray-Bans can do nearly all that the AirPods Pro can do and more. And since smart glasses are getting more and more common and the promise of smarter AI-powered features are on the horizon, getting a pair of Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses gives you a better chance of getting a taste of the future. Deals are subject to sell out or expire at any time, though ZDNET remains committed to finding, sharing, and updating the best product deals for you to score the best savings. Our team of experts regularly checks in on the deals we share to ensure they are still live and obtainable. We're sorry if you've missed out on a deal, but don't fret -- we constantly find new chances to save and share them with you on ZDNET.com.

Title: We uncovered 57 online clothing shops trying to scam Australians. And they’re just the tip of the iceberg

Search the news, stories & people Personalise the news and stay in the know Emergency Backstory Newsletters 中文新闻 BERITA BAHASA INDONESIA TOK PISIN By Lucy Carter By Matt Martino By Michael Workman ABC NEWS Verify Topic:Retail Industry At first glance, Vogue Melbourne looks every inch an upmarket Australian boutique. The website features photos of models in fashionable clothes and slogans like "Be You Be Beautiful". It boasts 100,000 satisfied customers, an extensive catalogue of items and claims to accept a range of reputable payment options. Look a little closer though and things aren't quite what they seem. You might have noticed that the site is advertising a Halloween sale with up to 50 per cent discounts. Halloween came and went at the end of October, but that sale has continued. Since ABC NEWS Verify started monitoring this site in early October, there has always been an up to 50 per cent discount advertised. Back then, it was called a "winter sale". Let's look closer at one product: this dress. It looks like a professionally taken photograph of a stylish garment. The site even gives it a "trademarked" name "Annaliese". The photos appear to have come from London fashion brand House of CB. The garment is the Lolita Apricot Corset Sundress, for sale with House of CB for $322 (currently on sale for $261). We also found the same photographs advertising the dress on Chinese shopping website AliExpress for as little as $19.09. So either Vogue Melbourne is getting a sweet deal on a designer fashion item, or it is shipping a cheap knock off. As the name — and this sandwich board — suggest, Vogue Melbourne claims to have a physical presence in Victoria's capital. It even lists a physical address on the home page, placing it inside Melbourne's upmarket Emporium shopping centre. But this image has been generated from a custom stock image company. And it's unlikely that a Sydney store will be opening anytime soon when there's no record of the Melbourne store inside the Emporium mall. Then there are the reviews. The site appears to be displaying an authentic Trustpilot review system, a legitimate website which allows customers to provide public feedback about businesses. Vogue Melbourne claims its Trustpilot rating is excellent — but again, it's a fake. The actual rating according to the real Trustpilot site? Bad. But surely it's not all negative, right? At least Vogue Melbourne offers a 30-day, money-back guarantee? Well, the site's real Trustpilot page is full of stories of that promise not being kept by the store. Vogue Melbourne presents itself as a high-end, Australian fashion retailer. But as you can see, it is anything but. ABC NEWS Verify has discovered many more sites just like it, all convincing Australians to part with their money, sometimes for an inferior product and sometimes for no product at all … How social media is giving scammers the tools they need to trick Australians into parting with their money. Vogue Melbourne is one of more than 50 shopping websites ABC NEWS Verify has tracked over several months that appear to be falsely representing themselves online as high-end Australian retailers. Almost exclusively run from overseas, the websites are mass-produced digital stores sometimes selling cheap and often poor-quality products imported directly from Asia. They have a strong and seemingly unchecked presence on Meta's social media platforms Facebook and Instagram. Despite having names like Sydney Stylista, Beaumont Gold Coast and Perth Apparel, Facebook transparency information often shows these pages have several administrators outside of Australia. Nonetheless, social media giant Meta allows these pages to run ads on its platforms that target Australians and funnel them to their websites. Many of the ads use similar language, and sometimes the same images that tug at the heart strings of shoppers, with talk of closing down sales, and shop fires. While there's nothing illegal about shipping goods in from another country, customers are being tricked into thinking they are shopping locally. They're left with little practical recourse for international returns or exchanges, and often hundreds of dollars out of pocket. Meta didn't respond directly to detailed questions from ABC NEWS Verify by time of publication, but confirmed they are looking into the flagged pages. "We are investigating this matter. Meta doesn't want scams on our platforms, and we are continuing to invest in tools and technology to prevent them. The safety of our users is of utmost importance, and we continue to work with industry, the government and law enforcement to protect Australians from scams." The 57 online stores ABC NEWS Verify has tracked are managed and run by different people and groups but have a very similar look online. The websites appear to have been designed and created using common templates on the e-commerce platform Shopify. They then advertise heavily on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. The products they sell are mostly mass-produced fast-fashion items, commonly produced in Asia. The sites all use a legal supply chain model called dropshipping. The product you receive has often been shipped from an entirely different country, without any direct handling from the seller. Normally, when you make a purchase on a website … … it's the retailer who ships the product directly to you. But with dropshipping, the retailer places an order with a supplier, who could be located in a completely different country. That supplier then ships the item directly to you, without the involvement of the retailer who you placed the order with. So what happens when you want to make a return or exchange? Some of these dropshipping websites offer them for "free". But you can't just return your item to the online store that you bought from. Buried in the returns policy fine print of many of the stores we investigated, was a clause which states returns are shipped back to a central warehouse in Asia. That's the original supplier. And while the buyer could possibly get their money back … … what they're often surprised to learn, often buried in the fine print, is that they have to foot the international shipping bill to send the item back to the supplier. This can sometimes be close to or equal the amount paid for the item in the first place. This is difficult for consumer regulators to police, as while dropshipping is a perfectly legal business model, where this scam begins is the misleading tactics being used to deceive shoppers into thinking they've been dealing with a local business. This can leave customers feeling misled, dissatisfied and out-of-pocket. Rosie Thomas, the director of campaigns at consumer watchdog Choice told ABC NEWS Verify that after thinking you've been dealing with an Australian business, the idea that you would have to pay to ship the item back overseas to return it often comes as "quite a shock". "Even if you return the item, if you don't get the refund, or you don't get the response that you would like, there are limited options in the digital environment as to where you can take your complaint." Catriona Lowe, the deputy chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission told ABC NEWS Verify that all customers shopping online in Australia — even with international operators — have rights. "All businesses that trade in Australia are required to comply with the Australian consumer law, and that includes not misleading consumers about where your business is based." "If consumers do feel that they've been misled by this conduct, we encourage them to get in contact either with our info centre or with their state and territory fair trading agencies." Retired music teacher Julie (not her real name) was excited when she spotted a colourful knitted jumper advertised for sale on Instagram by the now-defunct online store Aussie Hilda. At $84 the jumper wasn't an insignificant purchase for the aged pensioner, but she reasoned that its 'original price', at $250, was listed far higher and that she may have stumbled onto a bargain. "Very naively, my mind thought that it was a good quality item and it had been reduced. I thought it was coming from Australia. And I thought if there's any problem with it, I'll be able to just send it back to Australia, probably to Melbourne," she said. What arrived in the post several weeks later was far from the high-quality warm jumper she was expecting. Instead it was a low-quality polyester fabric with the pattern of a knit printed onto it. "I was just absolutely shocked to the socks about it, because it was just such a complete piece of garbage. "Thin plastic-y fabric has been used to make the jumper and then something is stamped onto it at the front and the back." The ACCC's Catriona Lowe says it appears Julie has the right to lodge a formal complaint. "It is incredibly important that the business is not misleading consumers about the nature of their business, about what they might expect in terms of delivery times and of course, that what they are purchasing, or what they can see online, matches what they ultimately are delivered." A second shock came when Julie tried to return the item and arrange a refund. "They said I'd have to send it back to some address in China somewhere, and that I would have to pay the postage to which I said to them, 'well, it's going to cost me almost the same amount in postage as it cost me for the actual item'," Julie said. Julie is one of more than 40 disgruntled customers of these websites that ABC NEWS Verify has spoken to as part of this investigation. She eventually managed to obtain a refund through PayPal after weeks of frustrating back and forth with Aussie Hilda administrators, who appear to be located in Indonesia. Extraordinarily, when the 73-year-old Sydneysider reported the page to Instagram's parent company Meta for its deceptive behaviour, she says her account was temporarily blocked, while Aussie Hilda's page remained active and advertising for many more weeks. "I would never buy anything through Instagram or Facebook again," she said. Choice's Ms Thomas says Meta needs to do much more. "We think, at a minimum, Meta should be verifying the identities of the businesses that it's taking money from to advertise on their platforms. "This would ensure that those businesses are who they say they are. And in the case of scams, should pick up whether or not it is an impersonation and and there's a significant risk for consumers." One of the most common deceptions we've seen the 57 tracked websites use is fake product reviews. In addition to the fake Trustpilot reviews highlighted earlier, many of these sites also display fake unbranded testimonials often using stock or AI generated images. The familiar names on these reviews below, for example, give away the game. The names do not even match the supplied photographs. These fake reviews often have wording that no human would ever actually use. Using dated Australian slang like "cobber" and describing delivery as "quick as a rat up a drainpipe", they appear to be crafted to seem authentic to Australians but are anything but. The lies and AI carry over to many of the ads we see plastered across Meta's social media platforms — with claims of shops closing down, burning down and using artificially generated store owners. We've also tracked shops stealing or altering photos of real Australian shopfronts. Legitimate Melbourne store Kloke had no idea a photo of its very real store was being used by Wilson Melbourne on its Facebook page, until contacted by ABC NEWS Verify. Fake Sydney outlet TrendyOz is actually a badly photoshopped photo of a Calvin Klein store in Sydney's CBD Westfield. Online store Vogue Melbourne claims to be run by Garry Williams, an Australian physiotherapist and Cècile Laurent, a "talented" French fashion designer. Vogue Melbourne presents these photographs of "Garry" and "Cècile" on its About Us page. As we mentioned, it claims Garry is Australian, and Cècile is French. But Vogue Melbourne is not the only shopping website these images appear on. They're also here on Marlo London, which targets British customers. But this time, Garry is English. At Modezentrum Krause, which looks identical but targets German customers, the language changes … Cècile and her profession remain. Garry, meanwhile, has been replaced by "Thomas Krause", who is now a German physiotherapist. ABC NEWS Verify has established the real identities of both of these people using open source intelligence techniques. Both had their images taken from their own websites or social media accounts, apparently without their knowledge. "Garry" is actually a Dutch man, who we were not able to contact. And "Cècile" is an American woman named Cora, who expressed astonishment that her image had been stolen and used on these websites when contacted by ABC NEWS Verify. "I had no idea they were using my photo or claiming it was them in the photo. There was definitely no consent given on my part," she said. "It is extremely confusing why they would take my photo and say that they are the ones in it. They are trying to deceive people and it's quite sickening. It's also just frustrating because that is a photo of me working and taken by a professional photographer which makes me feel violated." These three websites appear to be connected to each other through a single operator, as well as to a fourth website, Averley Boutique Toronto. The websites list the same Dutch business name and number in their terms and service pages and ABC NEWS Verify has also documented them using the same PayPal as a payment beneficiary. The beneficiary is listed as NYH E-Commerce. According to Dutch business records, the company has a sole shareholder and employee named Nadir El Haddouti. The postal address for the business is this self-storage unit in the Dutch city of Rotterdam. It isn't clear where Mr El Haddouti lives, but he has ties to both the Netherlands and the United Arab Emirates through his Dutch-registered business. His business number is also listed on the website of a luxury car rental company based in Dubai as well as a consultancy business geared towards minimising value-added tax for dropshippers, based in the Netherlands. Dutch business records show the operations related to his business number include the "renting of passenger cars and light motor vehicles" and "retail sale via internet of apparel and clothing accessories". Social media accounts belonging to the luxury car rental business, Carplug Dubai, suggest the operator mixes with others living opulent lifestyles. For instance, one video, which shows a young man revving a performance car valued at over $100,000, is captioned in Dutch "Samen met de jongste CEO van NL". This translates to "Together with the youngest CEO of NL [the Netherlands]". ABC NEWS Verify attempted to contact Mr El Haddouti through various channels, but received no response. Opaque ownership is common to the 57 pages tracked by ABC NEWS Verify. We detected ties to individuals based overseas in all the sites we tracked. Links to the Netherlands were frequently found among this cohort. Operating a business outside of Australia that dropships goods into the country is something that is perfectly legal and thus, outside the scope of regulators. Where it becomes a problem is when consumers think they are dealing with a local business, and all the imputations of quality and ease of dealings that come with that assumption. There's a whole industry built around creating websites just like these on gig economy websites like Fiverr. ABC NEWS Verify has seen a range of different prices and delivery times for fully operational shopping websites offered on that platform. The cheapest and quickest we came across was a 10-product website with a three-day delivery time for just under $50. We saw prices on other accounts for as much as $1,000 for a 50-product store delivered in a week. Some of these sellers go on to offer to manage the marketing and operation of the page for several hundred of dollars a month. ABC NEWS Verify also came across multiple websites that were almost identical in layout. We know the websites were being operated by different people because the PayPal beneficiaries were different, and their Facebook pages listed administrators in different countries. These four seemingly unrelated pages all appear to be modelled from a website called Sol and Sparrow Melbourne. Whoever built the three copies hasn't even bothered to delete Sol and Sparrow's name from the body copy on some of their product pages and some use the very same images. Shopify didn't respond to detailed questions from ABC NEWS Verify but a spokesperson confirmed it was investigating the online shops flagged. "Shopify's Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) clearly outlines what is not permitted on our platform. We're reviewing these stores and will take action on any found to violate our policies." There are now a range of companies online that allow these websites to be created with ease and at scale, meaning purveyors can dropship to anywhere in the world with little effort. It's clear these Australian-targeted websites we have uncovered are just the tip of an international iceberg. Remember that dress from before? A simple reverse image search shows a raft of similar internationally-focused websites on which it appears. This grift is truly global. As shoppers wade through Black Friday sales and then into Christmas shopping, many might be asking how they can keep themselves safe when seeking to buy high quality and good value products online. ABC NEWS Verify asked our experts from Choice and the ACCC for their top tips when it comes to shopping online and avoiding scams. Ms Thomas from Choice says slowing down is key. "Scam ads or fraudulent retailer ads very likely will create a sense of urgency to try and make you act quickly. "Take a moment to check the website, check the URL, see if there are any red flags that suggest that maybe this business is not what you think it is." (It's worth mentioning that none of the URLs we encountered in our investigation carried a .au Australian domain, though its presence in a URL doesn't necessarily mean the site you're looking at is not a scam.) Catriona Lowe from the ACCC agrees that doing a bit of homework can save heartache later on. Being skeptical of reviews posted directly on the website is a good start. "Be wary of websites that you're not familiar with, including if you might have received adverts about them on social media," she said. A really good thing to do is to check online forums and review sites, because often you might, you might find that other consumers will be talking. "And then the last tip that we give to people is, if you are feeling a little cautious you may wish to shop with a credit or debit card. What that means is, if something does go wrong, you may have the right to do what's called a chargeback, and that means actually reversing that transaction with your financial institution, rather than the particular business that you might have given those details to." ABC NEWS Verify spent months documenting and investigating overseas dropshipping operations that falsely claimed to have a physical presence in Australia. The operations were identified by reviewing advertisements targeting Australians on Meta's platforms like Facebook along with keyword searches of Meta's ad library. Our investigation focused on stores that had an implied and or explicit physical presence in Australia — ranging from stores using Australian locations in their names to dropshipping stores creating digital images of fake physical shop fronts in Australian locations. ABC NEWS Verify then investigated who was behind them, unearthing links across the globe including ties to countries such as the Netherlands, UAE, China and the United States. Our investigation also helped unveil some of the common tactics and practices these kinds of operations deploy. Although ABC NEWS Verify uncovered the identity of several overseas individuals and businesses linked to some stores, most remain opaque, due in part to measures by the operators to mask their ownership and because of the transparency limitations of the Australian version of Meta's ad library. Although Meta has greater transparency on digital ads than some other digital platforms, the company's ad transparency in Australia is limited compared to some jurisdictions like the EU. Meta in the EU is subject to the European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA) which, once introduced, compelled Meta to display and archive all ads that targeted people in the EU, and store them for a year. Detecting scammers and others abusing Meta's platforms in Australia remains a "whack-a-mole" exercise — one exacerbated by Meta's closure of the transparency tool CrowdTangle earlier this year.

Title: I've been looking for an LG OLED C4 deal all year, and Black Friday has finally delivered

The 55-inch LG OLED C4 is finally at the price I've been hoping for When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. I have been hoping, saving, and waiting for a Black Friday OLED TV deal this year. I got a 4K TV in August of 2020, and although it's served me very well, it's starting to get backlight bleed - an annoying degradation of the display where its backlight rings shine through the panel and become easy to spot. As someone who reviews all sorts of technology for a living, I know that OLED TVs are the ones worth spending money on these days, but they're not the easiest to afford. This year I've been scraping money together where I can, and I've been watching the price of LG's 55-inch OLED C4 like a hawk because I know that it's the perfect TV for me, but this brand's screens only enter my price range once or twice a year. I've been waiting for it to drop as close to the $1,000 mark as possible - mainly because I still want to be able to pay my rent. Black Friday has finally delivered the goods, because it's now down to $1,196.99 at Amazon, giving it a $300 discount. Besides a blip on the price history data that sort of looks like someone pressed the wrong button somewhere, this is the cheapest this screen has ever fallen to. A brief Black Friday OLED TV deal brought it down to $1,096 about two weeks ago before it was immediately hoisted back upward. The 55-inch models of LG's OLEDs can be tough to find deals for because they're one of the most popular sizes in the range, and stock can disappear in a heartbeat. LG OLED C4 55-inch TV | $1,499.99 $1,196.99 at AmazonSave $300 - This is likely as close to the $1,000 mark you'll find this display drop to before it starts being replaced by the inevitable C5. Sometimes you see this model get discounts in February as LG tries to get rid of stock, but it can be really tough to find good deals on these TVs from this point on. Buy it if: ✅ You want one of the best pound-for-pound gaming TVs on the market✅ You want a screen with a high refresh rate✅ You've been waiting for a good deal Don't buy it if: ❌ You can make do with a slower refresh rate❌ You need to keep saving for now Price check: $1,296 at Walmart | $1,199.99 at Best Buy UK: £1,199 at Currys So why is it the LG OLED C4 that I'm so desperate to go for? Other brands do make OLED displays these days, and some of them can be a bit cheaper than LG. Well, for starters, I know that LG is the company that makes the OLED technology for a lot of smaller TV brands, so you know you're getting the purest form of panel straight from the source if you buy from them. Next, it's the 55-inch size I'm looking for because that suits my home the most. A 65-inch 4K display might actually look like better quality due to viewing distances and pixel densities, but I think that size of screen would be a bit intense for the room I'd put it in. I think 55-inch is the best value spot for a living room screen size worth investing in, without overspending on the sizes TV manufacturers tell you you need. Then there are specs, which might help you to decide which of the best gaming TVs is the best for you. I watch a lot of movies and TV shows, and my time for viewing them is sacred. I want to make it as close to a cinema atmosphere as possible, and an OLED panel combined with Dolby Vision support will really bring that feeling home. Next, I want to use it for PC gaming, so I'd like a high refresh rate. The C4 sports a stunning 144Hz refresh rate that my Maingear Zero Ruby will absolutely be able to make use of. I wouldn't wait around if any of this sounds relatable to you. LG OLEDs are popular choices, and I'd expect the 55-inch model to fly off the shelves this Black Friday. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more There are other offers to make the most of if this is out of your price range. Black Friday Meta Quest deals, Black Friday Xbox deals, and Black Friday CPU deals might get you a bigger saving that's more achievable for you. One of my earliest memories is playing SuperMario64 and wondering why the controller I held had three grips, but I only had two hands. Ever since I've been in love with video games and their technology. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship at Expert Reviews. Over the last decade, I’ve been managing my own YouTube channel about my love of games too. These days, I'm one of the resident hardware nerds at GamesRadar+, and I take the lead on our coverage of gaming PCs, VR, controllers, gaming chairs, and content creation gear. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension.

We already touched down this morning with our master roundup of the best Thanksgiving price drops, but there’s even more to come and some particular highlights we wanted to showcase. We have now have a new all-time low Microsoft’s Surface Laptop 7 with 12-core Snapdragon X Elite chip at over $400 off alongside a giant selection of other Snapdragon and Chromebook deals. Those offers join Google’s Black Friday price drop on Pixel 9 Pro XL that is now $100 less than advertised, a rare deal on Meta Quest 3 for Black Friday, the very first discount on the new supersized Echo Show 21 smart display, and the best price ever on the 2024 Samsung S24 FE from $450 shipped. But all that’s all just for starters, head below for a closer look at today’s 9to5Toys Lunch Break. As part of its Black Friday Week deals, Amazon is now offering Microsoft’s 2024 Surface Laptop 7 Copilot+ PC at $999 shipped. That’s $401 less than its usual going rate of $1,400 and the lowest we have tracked for it so far. Today’s 29% offer drops this touchscreen Copilot+ PC with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD $100 below its previous all-time low, and it’s now only $100 more than its relatively less powerful sibling with the Snapdragon X Plus chip. The new Surface Laptop 7 is available in Platinum, Black, Dune, and Sapphire colorways, and they’re all down to the $999 low today. The same model, in case you’re wondering, is currently fetching $1,100 at Best Buy. Head below for more details. Featured deal: Roborock is launching its biggest deals of the year for Black Friday 2024, delivering up to 67% in savings on many of its most sought-after smart cleaning bots. The Roborock Qrevo series is seeing as much as $650 in savings ahead of Thanksgiving this year alongside up to $700 off the going rate on a range of other models in its lineup of intelligent vacuum and mopping systems. The Roborock deals kick off starting from $140 this year and you’ll find some highlights listed below: While the official Google Black Friday sale got off to an early start this year only to see Amazon and Best Buy get aggressive with even deeper deals, the Pixel 9 Pro XL has now dropped again. Google advertised and subsequently launched a $150 price drop on this model and now Amazon has it starting down at $849 shipped – Best Buy has since priced matched on this model as well. Regularly $1,099, this is a straight $250 price drop to deliver a new Amazon all-time low and the lowest we have tracked to date on Google’s latest XL-sized handset. Best Buy is currently offering a $75 gift card with Meta’s 512GB Quest 3 VR headset at $499.99 shipped as a part of its Black Friday Doorbuster deals. This particular headset dropped to the $499 mark after the Quest 3S debut in September. Today’s Black Friday deal essentially lands a $75 discount on it with a FREE gift card that can go towards your other purchases at Best Buy. Head below for more details. Featured deal: Narwal has now kicked off its official 2024 Black Friday sale with both its latests and greatest intelligent cleaning bots alongside some ultra-affordable models at under $280. You’ll find its latest flagship model with a massive $400 in savings as well as Freo X – it most powerful model – at its lowest price ever with 50% in savings, not to mention a solid $100 price drop on its “one-pass perfection” upright vacuum and mop solution. Update 11/28: Amazon has now price matched the Best Buy Doorbuster offer starting $449.99 shipped. Update 11/28: Best Buy’s next Doorbuster sale is now offering the new Samsung S24 FE from $449.99 shipped to deliver the lowest price we have tracked to date at $200 off the going rate – this deal is currently undercutting both Samsung and Amazon. Featured deal: The Yaber Black Friday sale has arrived with hundreds in savings across its lineup of home projectors starting from just $133. The brand’s K3 Google TV projector solution provides direct access to Netflix and 7,000 other apps, with JBL audio, and a design ready for both indoor and outdoor use. Providing screen sizes that put your smart TV to shame at a fraction of the price you’ll spend on even the most affordable models, many of them include Google Assistant voice command control alongside auto instant setup tech to have you up and running in no time. Scope out the deals below: As part of its Black Friday Week deals, Amazon is offering Samsung’s latest 49-inch Odyssey G9 (G95C) gaming monitor for $759.98 shipped. This particular gaming display has been sitting at the $1,000 mark lately with some occasional jumps to its full $1,300 price. Today’s 42% or $540 discount on its listed price knocks this model $40 below its previous Amazon all-time low, marking a new low price to beat. The same monitor is currently fetching $800 directly at Samsung as a part of its ongoing Black Friday sale, and you can learn more about it below. The official Samsung Black Friday sale continues and we are now tracking even deeper deals on its latest foldable, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6. Both of these handsets debuted earlier this year as the brand’s latest and greatest in foldable handsets and we are now tracking massive price drops on unlocked units with as much as $800 in savings before you even factor in the trade-in values. Scope out the details below. After dishing out its official 18-page Black Friday Holiday Gift Guide last week, Razer has now kicked off its main Black Friday 2024 sale event with huge savings of up to 60%. The brand is calling it the Cyber Weekend Specials and offering a ton of fresh deals on everything from gaming peripherals to big ticket items like its Blade gaming laptops. It’s even offering a “mystery Razer Swag item” with orders above $199 while stock lasts on its site. All of that and more discounted pieces of Razer gaming gear are waiting for you down below. The Samsung Black Friday sale is now live, but so is the Amazon Black Friday Week Deals, and the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro price drops are now at the ready. While you will find the regularly $250 flagship earbuds marked down to $189.99 shipped directly from Samsung, Amazon is sweetening the pot significantly with its own deal price at $188.98 shipped alongside a FREE $20 Amazon gift card with purchase. That’s a total value of $270 and of $81 in effective savings when you factor in the value of the gift card you’ll be able to use towards additional Black Friday deals if you order sooner than not. As per usual, if you have some gear to trade-in against the new Galaxy Buds Pro 3, you can score an up to $100 instant trade-in credit against the already marked down purchase price here. That would leave you with a price at $90 for the new 2024 in-ears, and the lowest price on the internet, but only if you have some gear to flip in the holster. As you likely by now, the official 2024 Google Black Friday sale is live with the best deals we have tracked on just about all of its latest Pixel gear. But for folks not bothered by the latest and greatest releases, the Pixel Watch 2 just dropped to a new Amazon all-time low as part of the retailer’s Black Friday Week Deals. You’ll now find Pixel Watch 2 in various colorways starting down at $145 shipped, or $105 under the current going rate. It is important to remember, however, that this smartwatch carried a regular price of $350 before Google officially lowered the MSRP when the Pixel Watch 3 released. The official Samsung Black Friday sale is now live with massive price drops on a huge selection of its latest tech, wearables, smartphones, and smart TVs included. You will find its latest Galaxy Watch 7 now starting down at $239.99 in the 40mm size alongside the 44mm going for $269.99 shipped, but Amazon now has those prices beat. While the band color and style options are a little bit more limited at Amazon, you’ll now find the 40mm Galaxy Watch 7 starting down at $202.60 and the 44mm model starting at $247.48 shipped. Regularly $300 and $330, respectively, you’re looking at nearly $100 in savings here – more specifically over $97 and $82 off. Update: The deals below also now come along with a $90 Amazon credit! If you were waiting for Black Friday 2024 deals to cop Ray-Ban’s Meta smart glasses, then now is your time to strike as they’re seeing a 20% discount right now. This Black Friday offer, which is now live at Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and even Meta’s online store, applies to every frame and style of the Meta Ray-Bans including Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner starting from $239.20 shipped. This is the best deal we’ve tracked for this piece of wearable that hasn’t seen many discounts, so you might want to grab them while supplies last. Head below for more details. The official OnePlus Black Friday deals are now live and up for grabs directly from the official OnePlus site. Spanning its entire range of latest-generation tech, from the OnePlus 12 and Open foldable right through to the Watch 2R, pro-grade buds, and the OnePlus Tab 2, we are looking at some of the best prices of the year. Head below for a rundown of the exact Black Friday OnePlus deal prices – there’s up to $500 off smartphones as well as a host of freebie earbud add-ons thrown in across the lineup alongside the straight up cash markdowns here. OnePlus Black Friday smartphone deals OnePlus Watch Black Friday deals OnePlus Buds Black Friday deals OnePlus Pad Black Friday deals While we are now seeing sizable price drops on the Samsung Frame smart TVs at up to $1,300 off, the 2024 Hisense models are now also sitting at Amazon all-time lows as part of its Black Friday Week Deals. The Hisense CanvasTV delivers a very smilier picture frame-style experience as Samsung, just at a much lower price and with a display running on the Google TV platform. The 55-inch model is now on sale for $699.99 shipped and the 75-incher is going for $799.99 shipped. Regularly $1,000 and $1,300, respectively, you’re looking at 30% price drops to deliver the lowest prices we can find. Update: Amazon has now dropped prices even lower on both the single and 4-pack of the latest Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2 items trackers as part of its Black Friday Week Deals. Alongside singles down at just $19.49 Prime shipped, Amazon has now knocked the 4-pack of Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2 items trackers down to $59.48 shipped. Regularly $100, this is 38% off and the lowest price we have tracked on Amazon all-time. There were a couple fleeting Woot deals that had the 4-pack for a few bucks less than this, but are talking about a new Amazon low here that is only $3+ more than the best price ever. This is $15.50 per tracker. The super rare deals in the Arc Black Friday sale are now live. We have already featured the offers available on the brand’s popular Bumper Cases for iPhone, and now it’s time to look at the Samsung Galaxy side of the lineup. Price drops on the brand’s popular bumper-style cases are rare at best, outside of our exclusive discounts that is, but the Black Friday deals are offering 15% off sitewide to deliver the best deals we have tracked all year. You’ll find options for the Samsung S24 Ultra as well as the previous-generation S23 and S22 Ultra models starting from just over $38 right now – click this link and hit up the pull-down menu in the top left corner to find the Galaxy models (final discounted prices appear in the cart). Head below for more details. As part of its now live early access Black Friday deals, Samsung is offering up to $1,300 in savings on its latest model The Frame smart TVs. While several models and sizes are now either matching or slightly below our previous mentions directly from Samsung, you’ll also want to double check with Amazon as it is now doing its usual thing, slightly undercutting the direct prices by a few bucks on several sizes. Pricing kicks off from $550 shipped today (or $548 over at Amazon) and you can head below to scope out the deals across the various sizes of the 2024 Samsung The Frame lineup. As a part of its now live Black Friday sale, Samsung is offering its Galaxy Chromebook Plus in Neptune Blue for $599.99 shipped. That’s $100 off a brand new Chromebook that debuted last month carrying a $700 price tag. Today’s deal lands the first discount for this Chromebook Plus machine, marking a new low price to beat. It comes with all the bells and whistles you’d expect from a modern Chromebook out there, and you can learn more about it below. Samsung is now offering the best prices we have tracked to date on its brand new Tab S10 Ultra and Plus model tablets at up to $230 off before trade-ins. While we have featured some elevated trade-in values alongside some instant Samsung credit without trades, there’re now straight up cash savings on top of all of it. The official Samsung site is now offering the Galaxy Tab S10+ starting at $849.99 shipped from the usual $1,000 sticker price as well as the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra starting at $999.99 shipped, down from the regular $1,200. That’s $150 and $200 in savings, the best straight up cash deals to date, and the lowest prices we can find anywhere, but the deals get even sweeter with bonus credits and with higher storage capacity configurations. Head below for the details.
