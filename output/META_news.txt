Title: Mark Zuckerberg’s 2024 Election Plan: Make Facebook, Instagram Less Political

Sports and celebrity news are now prioritized over election coverage on Meta’s social media platforms You may have noticed less political content on your Instagram and Facebook feeds this year — and that’s by design. Specifically, it’s the design of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who, according to The New York Times on Tuesday, wants his platforms to be less politically charged heading into the 2024 election. “On Facebook, Instagram and Threads, political content is less heavily featured,” the Times reported. “App settings have been automatically set to de-emphasize the posts that users see about campaigns and candidates.” Rather than political coverage, Meta’s apps are now more likely to recommend sports, cooking and celebrity news. That’s a stark change from four years ago, when Meta — then still under its original Facebook name — hit users with political news more frequently. The company, at the same time, actively policed content tied to the Trump-Biden election, as well as COVID-19. In mid-2020, Facebook started putting warning labels on posts from politicians and public figures that it deemed misinformation; the company also expanded its “hate speech” policy at the time. Zuckerberg, in the year leading up to the 2020 election, said he was “very focused on election security“; the company changed its rules around political ads, making it so American political advertisers had to have a U.S. address, for example. Facebook also had 40 teams, including an “election security” team, that partnered with Homeland Security, law enforcement and state and local election officials to oversee how the election was presented on Facebook and Instagram. That’s become less of a concern for Zuckerberg this time around. For instance, Zuckerberg no longer meets with his heads of election security on a weekly basis, the NYT reported, adding: “He has reduced the number of full-time employees working on the issue and disbanded the election integrity team … though the company says the election integrity workers were integrated into other teams.” Facebook was also active on the political front in the months after the 2020 election. Most notably, the company “indefinitely” banned Trump, saying the risk of having him on the platform was “simply too great” after the January 2021 Capitol Riot (Facebook and Instagram lifted all restrictions on Trump in July). One reason to expect Meta’s shift away from politics to continue: it hasn’t hurt business. The company’s stock price has nearly doubled since Election Day 2020, and is up 63% on the year to $564 per share. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Super League Gaming stock hits 52-week low at $0.52
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/super-league-gaming-stock-hits-52week-low-at-052-93CH-3630391

Super League Gaming Inc. (NASDAQ:SLE) shares tumbled to a 52-week low this week, touching down at $0.52. The esports community and content platform has faced a challenging market environment, reflecting a broader downturn in tech and entertainment stocks. Over the past year, Super League Gaming has seen its stock price plummet, with a staggering 1-year change of -71.12%. This significant decline has brought the company's shares to their lowest point in the last year, underscoring the hurdles the company faces as it strives to pivot its strategy and regain investor confidence amidst a rapidly evolving digital landscape. In other recent news, Super League Gaming has released its Q2 2024 financial results, highlighting a strategic push toward profitability by Q4 2024. The company's operational progress is marked by a decrease in operating expenses and losses, and an expansion of partnerships and offerings. One significant collaboration is with Meta-Stadiums in the metaverse, aiming to create virtual stadiums. Despite flat revenues in Q2 2024 and delays in advertising campaigns due to inflation's impact on consumer spending, Super League Gaming has seen a decrease in operating expenses and losses. This indicates improved efficiency and a promising outlook for the company. The company has also launched immersive experiences with major brands such as the International Olympic Committee, Visa (NYSE:V), Maybelline, Claire's, Skechers, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Universal Pictures. These collaborations have led to high engagement and conversion rates. In further developments, Super League Gaming is focusing on transitioning repeat customers into long-term campaigns and setting annual booking records. The company's CEO, Ann Hand, expressed confidence in the company's strategy and its role in the future of immersive worlds as a media channel. Super League Gaming Inc. (SLE) has been navigating a turbulent period, as reflected in the company's recent market performance. According to InvestingPro data, the company's market capitalization stands at a modest 5.63 million USD, illustrating the scale of its financial footprint in the esports and entertainment industry. Despite the challenges, one of the InvestingPro Tips highlights that SLE holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, which could provide some financial flexibility in its strategic pivot. Additionally, the stock's recent movements suggest it is in oversold territory, based on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), hinting at a potential undervaluation by the market. However, with a negative price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of -0.08 and an adjusted P/E ratio for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 at -0.23, investors are shown a company that is not currently generating profits relative to its share price. The revenue growth of 25.12% over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 does provide a silver lining, indicating some level of business expansion despite the stock price's decline. It is also worth noting that the stock has been quite volatile, with a 1-week price total return of -22.3% and a 1-year price total return of -69.49%, which may deter risk-averse investors. For readers interested in a deeper analysis, there are additional InvestingPro Tips available on the platform, which could offer further insights into Super League Gaming's financial health and stock performance.

Title: 3 reasons why investors should remain bullish on Apple stock – Needham
URL: https://macdailynews.com/2024/09/24/3-reasons-why-investors-should-remain-bullish-on-apple-stock-needham/
Time Published: 2024-09-24T16:01:07Z

Update font size. Reset Needham & Company analysts have outlined three compelling reasons for investors to maintain a bullish outlook on Apple stock, even amidst concerns about the company’s reliance on the iPhone. These analysts believe that Apple’s strong “stable and liquid” fundamentals, huge share repurchase program, and the company’s strong cash position provide a solid foundation for continued growth and success. Sam Boughedda for Investing.com: ‎ The analysts note that while competitors like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta are heavily investing in generative AI (GenAI) infrastructure with no immediate revenue boost, Apple stands out as a stable and liquid stock. Needham says Apple is actively reducing its equity base through share buybacks, which is expected to drive earnings per share (EPS) growth. The company’s $110 billion share repurchase authorization from May 2024 is projected to lead to 11% EPS growth in fiscal year 2025 and 12% in 2026, according to Needham estimates. Needham believes Apple’s commitment to achieving “net cash zero” from its current net cash position of about $50 billion, along with $91 billion in cash from operations reported in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, suggests accelerated share repurchases in the near future. ‎ MacDailyNews Note: Needham maintains a Buy rating on Apple with a target price of $260 per share, an upside of some 16% over the current price.

Title: The Quest 3 may undergo a significant pricing change
URL: https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/meta-could-discontinue-128gb-quest-3/
Time Published: 2024-09-24T15:46:40Z
Full Content:
Meta Connect 2024 is tomorrow, which means the much-leaked Meta Quest 3S is about to be revealed (we hope). Despite the event being only hours away, however, there are still more leaks to be had. The latest information, spotted by TechRadar, suggests that with the launch of the 3S, Meta will discount both Meta Quest 3 models and stop production of the 128GB model sometime in November. These leaks come from X (formerly Twitter) users CezaryXR, the editor-in-chief at XR Daily News, and Lunayian, who has posted multiple Quest 3S leaks before, including images of what appears to be marketing material for the 3S. Finally, later in March 2023 u/LuffySanKira on Reddit claims they were shown these &quot;Meta Quest 3s&quot; mockups in what was likely a User Research Zoom call. They were deleted shortly after. The account has an age of 3 years with little activity in VR, and is still active. 13/x 🧵 pic.twitter.com/kq0wTdDodz &mdash; Luna (@Lunayian) March 26, 2024 According to CezaryXR, there will be two models of the Quest 3S — a 128GB model priced at around $300 and a 256GB version for about $400. These prices are very similar to the Quest 2 and much lower than the Quest 3’s current $499 and $649 price tags. If the leak is accurate, Meta will also stop producing the 128GB Quest 3 model sometime in November, meaning it won’t be available to buy after stock runs out. At the same time, both Quest 3 models will get a discount — but we don’t know how low the prices will go. Exclusive Leak before Meta Connect: Meta will stop production of the 128GB Quest 3 by mid-November, leaving only the 512GB variant. Both versions will be discounted until the 128GB stock runs out, after which only the 512GB model will be available. &mdash; Cezary Sobociński (@CezaryXR) September 23, 2024 Although a discount sounds like a good thing, in the long run, it could raise the price overall. Once 128GB stock runs out, people will have no choice but to buy the 512GB model — and with that much storage, it seems very unlikely that even its discounted price will be close to the cheaper model’s $499. Assuming the Quest 3S pricing estimates are accurate, that will leave buyers with three options: Our first thoughts in looking at these prices are that people would love the super affordable Quest 3S models, but sales for the Quest 3 would surely go down. It’s hard to believe that’s what Meta wants, so there’s definitely room for these leaks to be a little off. It’s all unofficial speculation anyway, so it’s always best to take it with skepticism The best part about this leak is that we only need to wait 24 hours to have the record set straight. Make sure to check our coverage of Meta Connect tomorrow for all the latest news on the Quest 3S and the fate of the Quest 3. An enhanced version of a Quest 3S leaked image reveals a possible design. LuffySanKira via Luna / Reddit via X Meta is expected to launch a new low-cost VR headset this year to replace the Meta Quest 2, the world's most popular VR headset. In what’s becoming a tradition for many electronic devices, we already have a good idea of what this new mixed reality headset will look like, its specifications, and more ahead of Meta's official announcement. Logitech has announced its first piece of hardware in the VR space, a stylus that lets you draw and paint in 3D on the Meta Quest 3. The MX Ink Stylus is a familiar-looking sketching tool that works hand in hand with the Quest controller to drastically expand the capabilities of the popular Quest 3 VR headset. The MX Ink also works with the Quest Pro and Quest 2 and supports several painting and sculpting Quest apps, including Gravity Sketch, PaintingVR, OpenBrush, ShapesXR, GestureVR, Arkio, and Engage XR. If you connect your Quest to a VR-ready PC, you can use the MX Ink Stylus with Adobe’s Substance Modeler and Elucis by Realize Medical. The Meta Quest 3 was already one of the best VR headsets for mixed reality, while keeping costs affordable. Soon Quest 3 owners will see a big upgrade that removes the distortion that sometimes broke the immersive feeling, simply by updating their headsets. Meta has announced the v66 software update that, among many things, comes with improvements to the Quest 3's passthrough cameras. Since the Quest 3’s passthrough cameras are located a couple of inches in front of your eyes, the headset must adjust the image to match your true perspective. Otherwise, everything would seem slightly zoomed in. Distant objects are easy, but nearby hands hide a portion of the background, presenting a challenge.

Visa (V) shares fell Tuesday as the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) sued the payment processing giant over allegedly monopolistic behavior to protect its dominant position in the debit card market. "Visa has been the largest, most powerful debit network for over a decade," the DOJ wrote in the lawsuit, which was filed in Manhattan federal court. It alleged that the company's contracts with merchants "unlawfully inhibit competition and stifle innovation." An antitrust lawsuit led Visa and competing payment processor Plaid to abandon merger talks in January 2021. The DOJ said at the time that the planned $5.3 billion merger was an example of Visa's monopolistic behavior, as it looked to acquire a potential rival before it was large enough to effectively challenge it. "We are proud of the payments network we have built, the innovation we advance, and the economic opportunity we enable," said Visa General Counsel Julie Rottenberg in an email. "This lawsuit is meritless, and we will defend ourselves vigorously.” Bloomberg and The New York Times earlier reported a DOJ filing was imminent, causing Visa stock to trade lower throughout the session Tuesday. The shares closed down more than 5%. The lawsuit is the latest move from the DOJ and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in recent years to use antitrust laws to block mergers and challenge dominant companies like Ticketmaster parent Live Nation (LYV), Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL), and Alphabet's Google (GOOGL). Visa shares fell more than 5% to $273.76 soon before the closing bell Tuesday. They are up 5% this year. UPDATE: This story has been updated to note the filing of the lawsuit, add a statement from Visa, and update the share price.

LOS ANGELES - BlackLine, Inc. (NASDAQ:BL), a provider of financial automation software solutions, announced Monday the appointment of David Henshall to its Board of Directors. Henshall's extensive background in enterprise software and financial management is expected to strengthen the company's strategic direction and governance. Henshall has a notable history in executive roles at Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS), where he spent nearly two decades, including time as President and CEO. His tenure at Citrix was marked by a significant push towards cloud computing, which positively impacted the company's operational performance. Before his time at Citrix, he held executive positions, including Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, contributing to his deep understanding of financial operations in the technology sector. BlackLine's leadership expressed strong support for Henshall's appointment. Co-CEO and Chairman Owen Ryan highlighted Henshall's unique executive experience and alignment with BlackLine's vision and operating model. Co-CEO and Founder Therese Tucker anticipates that Henshall's insights will bolster the company's strategic initiatives and help deliver value to customers and investors. In response to his appointment, Henshall expressed honor in joining BlackLine's Board and commended the company's market position and platform capabilities that serve the office of the CFO. He looks forward to contributing to BlackLine's ongoing growth and success. David Henshall's board experience extends beyond BlackLine, with active roles on the boards of HashiCorp (NASDAQ:HCP), Inc., Aspen Technology (NASDAQ:AZPN), Inc., and Feedzai, Inc. His past board chairmanship at Everbridge (NASDAQ:EVBG), Inc., and directorship roles at New Relic (NYSE:NEWR), Inc., and LogMeIn (NASDAQ:LOGM), Inc., reflect his extensive governance experience. BlackLine's platform aims to transform digital finance by providing organizations with accurate, efficient, and intelligent financial operations, a mission that Henshall's expertise is set to enhance. The company's commitment to innovation, security practices, and customer partnership is underscored by its global customer base of over 4,400 enterprises. This move comes as part of BlackLine's strategy to continuously evolve its governance and operational strategies, with an eye on long-term growth. The information in this article is based on a press release statement from BlackLine, Inc. In other recent news, BlackLine, Inc. reported a significant growth in its Q2 2024 earnings with a revenue of $161 million and a non-GAAP net income of $43 million. The company's strategic product portfolio, particularly in consolidation and financial analytics, had a strong quarter. On the other hand, Soros Capital Management made a notable move by completely selling off its stakes in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). The Saudi Public Investment Fund showed a bullish stance by adding call positions in PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Microsoft, and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), increasing the value of its U.S. stock holdings to roughly $20.7 billion. Jana Partners also established a new position in BlackLine Systems, owning nearly a 2% stake in the company. In more recent developments, BlackLine expects a total GAAP revenue for Q3 to be between $162 million and $164 million, indicating an 8% to 9% growth. Meanwhile, Soros Capital Management reduced its investments in major tech firms like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, and Meta Platforms. These are the recent highlights from the world of investments and finance. BlackLine, Inc. (NASDAQ:BL) shows a promising outlook with a market capitalization of $3.19 billion, reflecting its significance in the financial automation software solutions sector. This valuation is supported by a robust gross profit margin of 75.39% over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, indicating the company's efficiency in managing its cost of goods sold relative to its sales. Investors looking at the company's earnings potential will find that BlackLine is trading at a high Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.19, which has adjusted to a higher forward P/E ratio of 46.21 for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. This suggests that investors are expecting higher future earnings, which aligns with one of the InvestingPro Tips indicating that net income is expected to grow this year. Moreover, BlackLine's revenue growth remains positive, with an 11.94% increase over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, demonstrating the company's capacity to expand its sales. InvestingPro Tips also highlight that the company operates with a moderate level of debt, which can be an important factor for investors considering the financial stability of BlackLine.

Title: Oppenheimer analysts initiate coverage of Pinterest with "Outperform" rating
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/oppenheimer-analysts-initiate-coverage-of-pinterest-with-outperform-rating-3629814
Time Published: 2024-09-24T13:00:00Z
Full Content:
Investing.com -- Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) has the smallest daily active user base among social media companies, but there is "upside" to the company stemming from engagement and advertising on the platform, according to analysts at Oppenheimer. In a note to clients on Tuesday, the analysts noted that Pinterest, which is known for its pinboards designed to spark ideas on everything from recipes to weddings, has the fastest-growing digital advertising offering outside of Instagram-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). "Pinterest operates a global discovery platform with high-intent users in search of products and inspiration, lending itself well to direct response advertising. Relevant ads improve the core user experience, like magazines, driving strong advertiser [return on investment]," the Oppenheimer analysts wrote. They initiated their coverage of the firm with an "Outperform" rating and a share price target of $45. "Ads drive increased engagement, which brings more advertisers, better data, more users, and higher ad pricing. More than half of users think of Pinterest as a place to shop, and 96% of searches are unbranded (e.g., “red dress”) further indicating access to unique inventory," the Oppenheimer analysts said. In July, Pinterest's stock price tumbled by around 15% after the company's third-quarter revenue guidance missed Wall Street expectations. The business said it now expects to post sales of $885 million to $900 million during the period, below estimates of roughly $907 million. However, Pinterest said it had 522 million global monthly active users in the second quarter, above analysts' forecasts, while quarterly average revenue per person of $1.64 met estimates. Speaking in a post-earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Julia Donnelly noted that Pinterest's "more sophisticated advertisers continue to lean into the platform," although she flagged "broader headwinds" are weighing on ad spending by food and beverage groups. In general, however, Pinterest executives said the market for advertising was "relatively stable" in the second quarter.

Title: Meta might soon cut the Meta Quest 3 price and discontinue the 128GB model

The Meta Quest 3S could shake things up more than we thought When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Update: It's confirmed, Meta has officially discontinued three of its VR headsets including the 128GB Meta Quest 3, though it is getting a price cut while it's still available. Original story continues below. As I’m writing this, Meta Connect 2024 is just a day away, which means we’re also just a day away from (hopefully) finally seeing the Meta Quest 3S in action – Connect is where many expect the much-leaked headset will make its debut. But its arrival could also be the end of one of the two Meta Quest 3 models, because leaks suggest the 128GB Quest 3 could be discontinued after the 3S launch. This comes from two sources, @CezaryXR – Editor-In-Chief at XRDailyNews – and @Lunayian – the source of most Quest 3S leaks, just ahead of Meta itself. CezaryXR claims that the Quest 3S will have two models: a 128GB variant at around $300 and a 256GB model at around $400; this matches the price in that supposed leaked Amazon ad, and aligns roughly with the Quest 2’s prices of $299 / £299 / AU$479 and $399 / £399 / AU$599 for its two models respectively. What’s more, Meta will also reportedly stop production of the 128GB Quest 3 by mid-November – so when it sells out it won’t come back. Both current Quest 3 models (128GB and 512GB) will be discounted too. Exclusive Leak before Meta Connect:Meta will stop production of the 128GB Quest 3 by mid-November, leaving only the 512GB variant.Both versions will be discounted until the 128GB stock runs out, after which only the 512GB model will be available.September 23, 2024 Lunayian shared the post adding they “heard similar whispers” – however neither source can confirm what prices the Meta Quest 3 headsets will fall to. In either case, it’s worth remembering to take these leaks with a pinch of salt, however they do support my one big piece of advice for anyone keen to buy a VR headset right now: wait. While I think a Quest 3 price drop makes sense (more on that below) whether it happens or not the Quest 3S looks set to be a headset at least worth considering – something you can’t do until it’s official. One question I’ve had about the Quest 3S is how its value proposition will stack up against the regular Quest 3. Yes the rumors say it’ll be bulkier, and have slightly worse specs in areas like its display and RAM – but still boast an identical processor – though as long as these downgrades don’t affect its performance too massively, the main deciding factor will be price. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. And here there’s a lot of room for error. Make the Quest 3S too pricey and the Quest 3 will remain a no-brainer upgrade killing the new model, make it too cheap and the regular Quest 3’s sales could tank – yes older models get replaced eventually, but VR headsets are not yet at the yearly refresh cycle of smartphones (and they shouldn’t be). This is why I was starting to convince myself the Quest 3S would start at around $350, or even $400 rather than being as cheap as the Quest 2 like many hoped. The strategy outlined in the leak above however is an alternative way to walk this pricing tightrope. Eliminating the cheaper Quest 3 helps to create more of a distinction between the Quest 3S models and the top of the line Quest 3, meaning we can have our super-affordable Quest 3S without as much risk of it cannibalizing its predecessor. Unfortunately, while the Meta Quest 3 will get a price drop according to the leaks, I suspect the 512GB model will land a little above the 128GB version’s current price of $499 / £479 / AU$799. If that’s the case, then when the 128GB model sells out the Quest 3 would get an effective price increase, which wouldn’t be ideal. We’ll have to wait and see what’s announced at Meta Connect 2024 and beyond, but if the leaks hold true I’d recommend trying to snatch up a 128GB Meta Quest 3 while you can as that’s looking like my pick for the best of the four Quest 3/3S models, and it might not be around for much longer.

September 24, 2024 06:30 ET | Source: Radisson Mining Resources Inc. Radisson Mining Resources Inc. ROUYN-NORANDA, Quebec, Sept. 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Radisson Mining Resources Inc. (TSX-V: RDS, OTCQB: RMRDF) (“Radisson” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce results from three deep diamond drill holes completed at its 100%-owned O’Brien Gold Project (“O’Brien” or the “Project”) located in the Abitibi region of Québec. These results are part of Radisson’s ongoing and fully-funded 35,000 metre drill program, and represent the first deep drill holes of the current campaign. The three drill holes reported today represent an approximately 200 metre wide fence to the west, centre and east of the down-plunge extension of a high grade mineralization trend at the Project labeled “Trend 1.” The fence was located at a vertical depth of approximately 1,100 metres, 170 metres below the base of the existing Mineral Resource and below the level of the historic workings at the adjacent O’Brien mine. Of note, DDH OB-24-324, the central hole of the fence located directly below “Trend 1”, returned a wide intersection of high-grade mineralization with extensive visible gold (Figures 1, 2 & 3 and Tables 1 & 2). Results Highlights: Matt Manson, President & CEO, commented: “The results reported today represent a significant extension of high-grade mineralization at the O’Brien Project at depth. We have successfully intersected the down plunge extension of one of the principal high-grade gold trends at O’Brien. The 6-metre core interval of almost an ounce per tonne gold in OB-24-324, well mineralized throughout and with extensive visible gold, was achieved in the location predicted by our deposit model at a vertical depth of approximately 1,100 metres, a full 170 metres below previous drilling. For context, approximately 75% of our existing Mineral Resource is defined at depths above 600 metres. The two other deep holes reported today also intersected vein mineralization within alteration zones at the same depth, confirming the lateral continuity of the O’Brien mineralizing system generally and with noteworthy high-grade intercepts in OB-24-322 in particular. Taken together, this deep drilling is demonstrating the significant upside potential of the Project below the existing Mineral Resource. Two rigs are currently active, one targeting shallower targets within the existing Mineral Resource model, and one continuing to target deeper, down-plunge step-outs. We will be reporting additional drill results as they become available.” Figure 1: Long Section and Plan View of Gold Vein Mineralization and Mineral Resources at the O’Brien Gold Project, with DDH OB-24-321, 322 and 324 illustrated. Gold Mineralization at O’Brien Gold mineralizing quartz-sulphide veins at O’Brien occur within a thin band of interlayered mafic volcanic rocks, conglomerates, and porphyric andesitic sills of the Piché Group occurring adjacent to the east-west oriented Larder Lake-Cadillac Break (“LLCB”). Gold, along with pyrite and arsenopyrite, is typically associated with shearing and a pervasive biotite alteration, and developed within multiple Piché Group lithologies and, occasionally, the hanging-wall Pontiac meta-sedimentary rocks. As mapped at the Historic O’Brien mine, and now replicated in the modern drilling, individual veins are generally narrow, ranging from several centimetres up to several metres in thickness. Multiple veins occur sub-parallel to each other, as well as sub-parallel to the Piché lithologies and the LLCB. Individual veins have well-established lateral continuity, with near-vertical, high-grade shoots developed over significant lengths. The historic O’Brien mine produced over half a million ounces of gold from such veins and shoots at an average grade exceeding 15 g/t and over a vertical extent of at least 1,000 metres. Based on the modern drilling, the Project has estimated Indicated Mineral Resources of 0.50 million ounces (1.52 million tonnes at 10.26 g/t Au), with additional Inferred Mineral Resources of 0.45 million ounces (1.62 million tonnes at 8.64 g/t Au). Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Current exploration is focussed on delineating well developed vein mineralization to the east of the historic mine, with additional high-grade shoots becoming evident in the exploration data over what has been described as a series of repeating trends (“Trends 0 to 5”, Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2). Table 1: Summary Assay Results from DDH OB-24-321, 322 and 324 Notes on Calculation of Drill InterceptsThe O’Brien Gold Project March 2023 Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”) utilizes a 4.50 g/t Au bottom cutoff, a US$1600 gold price, a minimum mining width of 1.2 metres, and a 40 g/t Au upper cap on composites. Intercepts presented in Table 1 are calculated with a 3.00 g/t Au bottom cut-off, representing the lower limit of cut-off sensitivity presented in the March 2023 MRE. This methodology differs from previous Radisson disclosure, and intercepts reported in this release may not be directly comparable to historical published intercepts. Sample grades are uncapped. True widths, based on depth of intercept and drill hole inclination, are estimated to be 40-80% of core length. Table 2 presents additional drill intercepts calculated with a 1.00 g/t bottom cut-off over a minimum 1.0 metre core length so as to illustrate the frequency and continuity of mineralized intervals within which high-grade gold veins at O’Brien are developed. Drill Hole OB-24-321 did not return any intercepts averaging above 3.00 g/t Au based on unofficial assays received to date (official assay certificates for three samples in OB-24-321, covering the interval italicised in Table 2, are pending). Lithology Codes: PON-S3: Pontiac Sediments; V3-S, V3-N, V3-CEN: Basalt-South, North, Central; S1P: Piché conglomerate; S3P: Piché sediments; POR-S, POR-N: Porphyry South, North. Today’s Drill Results Today’s results are from three drill holes over 3,660 metres in Trend 1. Visible gold was observed in each hole. Holes were drilled on northerly declinations at initial inclinations of between -77 and -85 degrees, providing a high angle of incidence with the southerly dip of the Piché Group rocks and the vein mineralization. Estimated true widths of drill intercepts at the point of contact with mineralization is estimated to be between 40 and 80% of core length.

Title: 3 reasons why investors should remain bullish on Apple stock: Needham

Investing.com -- Needham & Company analysts provided three key reasons why investors should remain bullish on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock despite concerns about its dependence on the iPhone. The firm maintained a Buy rating on the stock in a note Tuesday, with a target price of $260 per share, representing a 16% upside. A Liquid Stock During Uncertainty: The analysts note that while competitors like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) are heavily investing in generative AI (GenAI) infrastructure with no immediate revenue boost, Apple stands out as a stable and liquid stock. In a volatile market, they argue that investors need a reliable stock to "hide in" during 2025, making Apple an attractive option. Share Repurchases Driving EPS Growth: Needham says Apple is actively reducing its equity base through share buybacks, which is expected to drive earnings per share (EPS) growth. The company's $110 billion share repurchase authorization from May 2024 is projected to lead to 11% EPS growth in fiscal year 2025 and 12% in 2026, according to Needham estimates. This continued buyback strategy is expected to support the bullish outlook for Apple. Strong Cash Position Enables Further Buybacks: Needham believes Apple's commitment to achieving "net cash zero" from its current net cash position of about $50 billion, along with $91 billion in cash from operations reported in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, suggests accelerated share repurchases in the near future. This financial strategy is expected to further enhance shareholder returns. Despite concerns about Apple's reliance on the iPhone and its slower pace of GenAI adoption compared to peers, Needham & Company believes Apple's financial discipline and stock buyback strategy make it a strong investment opportunity.

Title: Bernard Arnault plummets down the list of world’s richest men after a $54 billion collapse

“As long as I’m not the richest man in the world, I won’t really be happy,” Bernard Arnault once said. The day has come. Arnault, the founder and CEO of luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, went from being the richest person in the world to the fifth-most after a 20% drop in his company’s stock price, resulting in a $54 billion cut of his net worth. Arnault, who oversees dozens of prestigious brands including Moët Hennessy, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Givenchy, and Fendi, was worth an estimated $231 billion in late March, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That placed him ahead of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. As of Monday, Arnault was worth an estimated $177 billion. Now, Arnault ranks lower than each of those executives, plus Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. In the past year, LVMH stock has dropped over 16%, and is currently trading at about $132 per share; Arnault owns about 48% of the luxury conglomerate. Since the start of 2024, Arnault’s net worth is down $30 billion, making him the biggest loser on the list year-to-date. LVMH did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment. During the first half of 2024, LVMH reported a modest dip in revenues, but its wine and spirits divisions fared even worse. “Maybe the current global situation, be it geopolitical or macroeconomic, doesn’t lead people to cheer up and open bottles of champagne,” Jean-Jacques Guiony, LVMH’s chief financial officer, said during the company’s earnings call in late July. “I don’t really know. The matter of fact is, is that our volumes are down double digits.” But it’s not just LVMH that’s had a tough time in today’s market. Other major luxury brands and holding houses have reported losses this year. In fact, luxury revenues were flat during Q2 2024, the slowest growth in 15 quarters, according to a Bank of America note about luxury goods released Monday. Demand deteriorated during July, and August and September have also slowed. Michael Kors, housed under Capri Holdings, saw its first quarter revenue drop more than 14% year-over-year, according to Capri’s first quarter fiscal 2025 results posted Aug. 8. “Sometimes you’ll be the hottest thing on the block,” Michael Kors said in his testimony during an $8.5 billion antitrust trial involving Capri Holdings and Tapestry. “Sometimes you’ll be lukewarm. Sometimes you’ll be cold.” While Arnault has lost a tremendous amount of wealth this year as the result of the struggling luxury market, with a net worth of $177 billion, he’s still wealthier than former Microsoft CEOs Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer, as well as Warren Buffett, Michael Dell, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Plus, Arnault has stayed active in investing this year. His family office has invested in five AI-focused startups this year amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars. Plus, in July, he joined the chase to acquire Venice’s iconic Hotel Bauer for $305 million—but got outbid. Arnault, 75, isn’t ready to leave his post: He forced his board to extend the retirement age for its chairman and CEO from 75 to 80 so he could stay longer. But he received a letter from 93-year-old Warren Buffett saying he should’ve made the age limit higher, according to Bloomberg. Still, Arnault says he’s working 12-hour days. “Every morning I have fun when I arrive,” Arnault told Bloomberg. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Wall Street ends slightly higher after Fed policymakers back rate cuts
URL: https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/wall-street-ends-slightly-higher-after-fed-policymakers-back-rate-cuts
Time Published: 2024-09-23T21:21:58Z
Full Content:
NEW YORK – US stocks closed modestly higher on Sept 23 as investors assessed whether a trend will develop in the week following the Federal Reserve’s rate cut. The gains came amid comments from Fed policymakers and steady factory activity data, building on last week’s sharp market rally after the central bank’s decision to lower interest rates. The Fed’s pivotal move last week pushed major indexes to monthly gains, defying the historical trend of September as a weak month for equities. Comments on Sept 23 from three reserve bank presidents were the main focus as investors searched for clues on why the central bank kicked off its easing cycle with an outsized 50 basis-point cut. Fed officials including Mr Raphael Bostic, Mr Neel Kashkari and Mr Austan Goolsbee supported the central bank’s last rate cut and voiced support for more cuts in the rest of the year. Trader bets, as per the CME Group’s FedWatch tool, initially favoured a larger Fed move at its upcoming November meeting, after Governor Christopher Waller on Sept 20 flagged that upcoming inflation data could undershoot the Fed’s 2 per cent target. However, the bets have swayed since then and now appear to be a coin-toss, with markets expecting a total reduction of 74 basis points by the year end, according to LSEG data. On the data front, US business activity remained steady in September, while average prices for goods and services increased at the fastest pace in six months, potentially signalling a rise in inflation in the months ahead. “I think investors are still just sort of taking a wait-and-see attitude, if indeed a soft landing is the most likely outcome.” said Mr Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 61.29 points, or 0.15 per cent, to 42,124.65, the S&P 500 gained 16.02 points, or 0.28 per cent, to 5,718.57 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 25.95 points, or 0.14 per cent, to 17,974.27. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors were higher. Energy stocks led gains with a 1.31 per cent rise, while healthcare stocks declined 0.25 per cent. Among rate-sensitive growth stocks, Tesla jumped 4.65 per cent, while Meta Platforms rose 0.6 per cent after Citigroup lifted its price target on the stock. The Russell 2000 index, tracking small caps, was off 0.25 per cent. All eyes are on Sept 27’s personal consumption expenditures figure for August – the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge. Analysts say this release will be the week’s most significant catalyst. Among top movers, Intel rose 3.05 per cent after a media report said Apollo offered to make an investment of as much as US$5 billion (S$6.46 billion) in the chipmaker. General Motors slipped 1.72 per cent after Bernstein downgraded the carmaker’s stock to “market perform” from “outperform”. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.48-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. There were 505 new highs and 36 new lows on the NYSE. The S&P 500 posted 62 new 52-week highs and one new low while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 80 new highs and 123 new lows.

Title: Goldman Sachs maintains buy on Arista Networks, price target $430
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/goldman-sachs-maintains-buy-on-arista-networks-price-target-430-93CH-3628796
Time Published: 2024-09-23T21:04:15Z
Full Content:
On Monday, Goldman Sachs reiterated a Buy rating on Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) with a steady price target of $430.00. The firm is projecting Arista Networks to achieve approximately 20% revenue growth in 2024 and 2025, citing increased confidence in their earnings per share (EPS) estimates for these years. The revised EPS estimate for 2024 is now $8.39, up from the previous $8.35 and higher than the FactSet consensus of $8.27. For 2025, the EPS estimate has been set at $9.91, compared to the prior $9.86 and above the consensus of $9.39. The optimism from Goldman Sachs is based on several key factors, including anticipated capital expenditure from Arista's major cloud customers, such as Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The firm also highlighted the transition from pilot to production in three significant AI cluster projects expected in the next year and the momentum in Ethernet deployments across Arista's target five major AI cluster projects. Additionally, the firm noted Arista's expectations of increased front end networking investment relative to back end spending. Arista Networks' competitive edge is attributed to its top-tier switching platform, which offers scale up and scale out capabilities. This positions the company favorably in a market that is increasingly adopting integrated compute systems. Goldman Sachs anticipates that Arista will not only meet its $750 million AI revenue target in 2025 but will also continue to grow beyond that year. Goldman Sachs expects Arista Networks to outperform in the third quarter of 2024, surpassing revenue and margin expectations. This forecast aligns with the company's history of exceeding the midpoint of its EBIT margin guidance by an average of approximately 260 basis points over the last 26 quarters. In other recent news, Arista Networks has been in the spotlight with significant developments. The company reported a robust Q2 performance, with revenues reaching $1.69 billion, indicating a 15.9% increase year-over-year, primarily driven by services and software support renewals. Evercore ISI maintained its Outperform rating for Arista, based on the potential revenue opportunity from Meta's development of a massive new AI model training cluster. This could result in a possible $250 million in revenue for Arista if they secure the contract. Goldman Sachs reaffirmed its Buy rating on Arista, projecting a revenue growth target of at least 14% in 2024, while Deutsche Bank maintained its Hold rating, suggesting a positive outlook for the company's growth potential through 2025. Arista also repurchased $172 million of its common stock and generated $989 million in operating cash. These recent developments underscore the company's strong market position and potential for continued growth. However, it's important to note that operating expenses increased to $319.8 million due to higher headcount and new product introduction costs. With these developments, Arista Networks continues to make strides in its industry. As Goldman Sachs maintains a bullish stance on Arista Networks, citing robust revenue growth and competitive advantages, InvestingPro data and tips provide additional insights for investors considering ANET stock. The company's strong financial health is reflected in a market capitalization of $121.21 billion and significant revenue growth, with the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 showing a 19.93% increase. This aligns with Goldman Sachs' revenue growth projections for 2024 and 2025. InvestingPro Tips highlight Arista Networks as a prominent player in the Communications Equipment industry with a high return over the last year, suggesting investor confidence in the company's performance and strategy. Additionally, the company's liquid assets exceed short-term obligations, indicating a solid position to meet its financial commitments. However, investors should be aware of the stock trading at a high earnings multiple, with a P/E ratio of 48.95, and near its 52-week high, which could imply a premium valuation. For those seeking a deeper dive into Arista Networks' financial health and stock performance, InvestingPro offers 17 additional tips to help investors make informed decisions.

Title: Trump Media’s Stock Price Sinks to New Low After Insider Lockup Period Expires

Former president has said he has 'absolutely no intention' of selling his shares in company that operates Truth Social By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Shares of Donald Trump’s social media company, which operates the unprofitable Truth Social platform, dropped 10.3% Monday to their lowest price since the stock began trading under the ticker symbol “DJT” earlier in 2024. Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) stock closed at $12.15/share, down nearly 82% from the company’s peak closing price of $66.22/share on March 27. The slump for the stock comes after a six-month lockup period on shares held by TMTG insiders — including Trump, TMTG’s directors and officers, and certain other securityholders — expired at the end of regular trading Thursday, Sept. 19. Related Stories VIP+ Generative AI Fueling ‘Exponential’ Rise in Celebrity NIL Rip-Offs: Exclusive Data Peacock Releases Trailer for 'Teacup,' New Horror Series From James Wan (TV News Roundup) Trump has said he has “absolutely no intention of selling” his shares in TMTG. “A lot of people think the reason [the company’s stock price is] down is a lot of people think I’m going to sell, and if I sell, it’s not going to be the same,” Trump said at a Sept. 13 press conference, per CBS News. “But I have absolutely no intention of selling.” Popular on Variety TMTG’s market capitalization currently stands at about $2.4 billion. That’s down from an intraday peak of more than $9.5 billion on March 26, CNBC reported. As of Aug. 15, Trump beneficially owned 56.6% of TMTG’s outstanding shares, making his stake currently worth about $1.4 billion — down from $5.2 billion at stock’s the highest closing price. The 114.75 million shares Trump holds includes 36 million “earnout shares” that TMTG determined he was entitled to in accordance with the merger agreement. TMTG calls Truth Social a “safe harbor for free expression amid increasingly harsh censorship by Big Tech corporations.” For the second quarter of 2024, TMTG reported $836,900 in net sales and a net loss of $16.37 million, per its 10-Q SEC filing for the period. For Q1, the company reported $770,500 in revenue and a net loss of $327.6 million; most of the loss for the first three months of the year was due to expenses associated with TMTG’s merger with special purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition Corp. to become a publicly traded company. According to an Aug. 23 filing with the SEC, TMTG’s board and audit committee authorized a share repurchase of an aggregate of 128,138 shares of the company’s common stock “from certain executive employees” at a prevailing market price of $22.70 per share. As consideration for the repurchase, TMTG said, it will remit $2.9 million plus applicable penalties and interest to the IRS and certain state taxing authorities in connection with the March 7 issuance of the TMTG Executive Promissory Notes. “TMTG’s success depends in part on the popularity of our brand and the reputation and popularity of President Donald J. Trump,” the company said in its most recent 10-Q filing. “The value of TMTG’s brand may diminish if the popularity of President Donald J. Trump were to suffer. Adverse reactions to publicity relating to President Donald J. Trump, or the loss of his services, could adversely affect TMTG’s revenues, results of operations and its ability to maintain or generate a consumer base.” The filing also noted that Trump “is involved in numerous lawsuits and other matters that could damage his reputation.” Shares in TMTG began trading on Nasdaq on March 26, 2024, under the ticker symbol “DJT” following the company’s merger with DWAC. Trump formed TMTG in 2021 after the former president had been kicked off Twitter (now called X), Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and other internet platforms, which said he had violated prohibitions against inciting violence in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Trump’s accounts have been reinstated by X, Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, YouTube and others, but he continues to use Truth Social as his preferred social media platform. Truth Social launched in early 2022. “TMTG was founded to fight back against the big tech companies — Meta (Facebook, Instagram and Threads), X (formerly Twitter), Netflix, Alphabet (Google), Amazon and others — that may curtail debate in America and censor voices that contradict their ‘woke’ ideology,” the company says in its prospectus. TMTG has not disclosed how many people use Truth Social. “At this juncture in its development, TMTG believes that adhering to traditional key performance indicators, such as signups, average revenue per user, ad impressions and pricing, or active user accounts including monthly and daily active users, could potentially divert its focus from strategic evaluation with respect to the progress and growth of its business,” it says in an updated prospectus filed Sept. 5.

Title: European shares end higher as markets bet on more ECB policy easing

European shares closed higher on Monday as a soft business activity reading strengthened the case for more monetary policy easing by the European Central Bank this year, with rate-sensitive sectors such as real estate and utilities rising. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index closed 0.4 per cent higher, recouping some losses following its biggest one-day drop since August in the last session. Autos led gains among major Stoxx sectors with a 1.9 per cent advance, while retail also gained 1.2 per cent. A survey showed euro zone business activity contracted sharply and unexpectedly this month as the bloc’s dominant services industry flatlined while a downturn in manufacturing accelerated. “A payback from the Paris Olympics was largely expected. But today’s release was much worse than many had anticipated, suggesting a rather gloomy underlying growth picture for the euro zone,” said Fabio Balboni, senior economist, euro zone at HSBC. Ryanair traded flat on the day despite announcing that it had arranged to fly the Leinster rugby team to its European fixtures this season from Belfast instead of Dublin Airport amid an ongoing farrago over the annual passenger cap at the aviation hub. As expectations of further monetary easing by the European Central Bank increased both AIB and Bank of Ireland lost ground, declining 3.86 per cent and 1.53 per cent respectively. Food giant Kerry traded up 1.85 per cent €90.60 on the back positive sentiment for the sector. Other movers included home-builder Cairn, which fell 1 per cent to €1.89. Germany’s DAX closed 0.7 per cent up while France’s benchmark ended near flat, bogged down by falling bank stocks. French banks including Credit Agricole, SocGen and BNP Paribas were among top declines on the Stoxx index, with the euro zone banks index sliding 1.8 per cent. The euro slipped against the dollar, while the yield on the German two-year bond, which reflects near-term rate expectations, slipped to 2.149 per cent. Rate-sensitive real estate rose 1.3 per cent while utilities, often traded as a bond proxy, gained 1.1 per cent. The ECB cut interest rates in June and also earlier this month. Among individual stock moves, Germany’s Commerzbank slid 5.7 per cent after Berlin said it does not support a takeover by Italy’s UniCredit. UniCredit shares closed 3.3 per cent lower. Aurubis dropped 10.1 per cent after Europe’s largest copper producer guided for lower earnings next financial year as it expects metal prices to fall and after hurdles with a production ramp-up hit its fourth-quarter earnings. UK shares ended higher on Monday after logging their worst day since August in the previous session, boosted by rising commodity-linked shares, while drugmaker AstraZeneca fell following a disappointing experimental precision drug trial. The blue-chip FTSE 100 closed 0.4 per cent higher, while the more domestically-focused FTSE 250 midcap index added 0.1 per cent. Precious metal miners led gains among the major FTSE 350 indexes with a more than 2 per cent rise as gold prices scaled record highs, driven by Fed rate cuts and demand for the safe-haven asset on geopolitical risks in the Middle East. Heavyweight energy shares added 0.6 per cent, tracking elevated crude oil prices. Both indexes had notched up their worst day in nearly seven weeks on Friday after the Bank of England held interest rates steady on Thursday, even as the Federal Reserve cut benchmark rates by an outsized 50 basis points. Last week Britain’s consumer price inflation data – which is closely watched by the Bank of England for its monetary policy – pointed to persistent price pressures in the services sector. AstraZeneca slipped 1.7 per cent after the drugmaker said its experimental precision drug did not significantly improve overall survival for patients with a type of breast cancer in a late-stage trial. Wall Street’s main indexes trended higher in choppy trading on Monday as investors focused on comments from Federal Reserve policymakers and steady factory activity data following the central bank’s decision to commence monetary policy easing. The Fed’s pivotal move on monetary policy in the previous week propped up the main indexes for monthly gains, bucking a historical trend where September has been a weak month for equities on average. Comments from a number of policymakers were the main focus on the day as investors scoured for clues on why the central bank kicked off its easing cycle with an outsized 50 basis points cut. Fed presidents such as Raphael Bostic, Neel Kashkari and Austan Goolsbee supported the central bank’s last rate cut and voiced support for more cuts in the rest of the year. Ten out of the 11 S&P 500 sectors were higher. Real estate stocks lead gains with a 0.9 per cent rise, while healthcare stocks declined 0.1 per cent. Having rallied for much of the year, the S&P 500 is a whisker away from an all-time high and the blue-chip Dow hit another intraday record high. Among rate-sensitive growth stocks, Tesla jumped 4.8 per cent, while Meta rose 1 per cent after Citigroup lifted its price target on the stock. – Additional reporting by Reuters Eoin Burke-Kennedy is Economics Correspondent of The Irish Times Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

DA Davidson has revised its rating on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), transitioning from a "Buy" to a "Neutral" stance, while keeping the price target unchanged at $475.00. The adjustment comes amidst observations that competitors have caught up with Microsoft in the AI segment, which has been a significant factor in the company's previously high valuation. According to DA Davidson, the competitive landscape in AI technology has evolved to a point where Microsoft's leading edge has diminished. This change has led to a reassessment of the tech giant's stock, resulting in a downgrade. Despite this, the firm has decided to maintain the existing price target for Microsoft's shares. The firm's analysis places Microsoft at the fourth position within the Mag6 ranking, a leaderboard of major tech companies that includes Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google's parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), with Microsoft now trailing behind Amazon, Meta, and Apple. The Mag6 is often used as a benchmark to gauge the performance and valuation of leading tech companies. Microsoft's stock performance has been notably robust, with an increase of 92% since DA Davidson initiated coverage in January 2023. This growth outpaced the S&P 500's rise of 49% during the same period, highlighting Microsoft's strong market performance relative to the broader index. In other recent news, Constellation Energy and Microsoft have joined forces to restart a unit of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. This initiative is in response to the growing demand for electricity by tech companies, particularly for data centers that support advanced technologies. The revival will focus on Unit 1 of the facility, with an investment of approximately $1.6 billion and an expected operational date by 2028. Microsoft has agreed to purchase energy from the reactivated plant for a period of 20 years. Meanwhile, Google has made a significant move into the carbon offset market by purchasing 50,000 metric tons of nature-based carbon removal credits from a Brazilian startup named Mombak. This agreement represents Google's first venture into Brazilian carbon projects and is part of a larger commitment to achieve these credits by 2030. In a recent development, Mizuho reaffirmed its positive outlook on Microsoft shares, maintaining an Outperform rating following the announcement of a new $60 billion share repurchase program and a nearly 11% increase in its quarterly dividend. These financial strategies signal Microsoft's ongoing commitment to returning value to shareholders and confidence in its future performance. Similarly, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)., the parent company of Facebook, has entered into an agreement with BTG Pactual’s forestry arm to acquire up to 3.9 million carbon offset credits. This deal extends through 2038 and is part of Meta’s strategy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030. The credits originate from BTG Pactual Timberland Investment Group's forest restoration efforts in Latin America. As Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) faces a shifting competitive landscape in AI technology, it's essential to consider various financial metrics that offer a broader understanding of the company's current market position. With a market capitalization of $2.4 trillion, Microsoft stands as a colossal player in the tech industry. The company's P/E ratio, a measure of its current share price relative to its per-share earnings, is 36.79, indicating a high valuation in the market. This is further emphasized by its P/E ratio for the last twelve months as of Q4 2024, which is slightly lower at 36.61. Microsoft's revenue growth remains solid, with a 15.67% increase over the last twelve months as of Q4 2024, showcasing the company's ability to expand its sales. Additionally, the firm's gross profit margin of 69.76% during the same period reflects its efficiency in controlling the costs associated with its goods and services. From an investment standpoint, two InvestingPro Tips highlight Microsoft's financial stability and market presence. The company has raised its dividend for 19 consecutive years, demonstrating a commitment to returning value to shareholders. Moreover, Microsoft is recognized as a prominent player in the software industry, which aligns with its historical performance and the maintained price target by DA Davidson despite the downgrade to a "Neutral" stance. For investors looking for more in-depth analysis and additional tips, InvestingPro offers a total of 15 InvestingPro Tips for Microsoft, which can be accessed through the platform to aid in making informed investment decisions.

Title: FTC trustbuster Lina Khan: feared in boardrooms, cheered on by progressive

Watch CBS News By Lesley Stahl September 22, 2024 / 7:00 PM EDT / CBS News Everywhere you go people are complaining about inflation: voters say it's their number one issue. Enter trustbuster Lina Khan – the youngest chair ever of the Federal Trade Commission – just 32 when she was named. She says much of the blame for the exorbitant prices on everything from food to concert tickets, is widespread corporate consolidation. The FTC's mission is breaking illegal monopolies, blocking mergers that stifle competition, and protecting consumers from a system Lina Khan says is rigged against them. But she's so aggressive that she's feared and loathed in boardrooms - seen as a zealot and a bully, and yet -- At town hall meetings around the country, Lina Khan is often swarmed by young people taking selfies, small business owners giving her cards, union members – to whom she preaches the perils of business monopolies. Lina Khan: Too often fewer and fewer companies are controlling more and more of the market. And what that means is companies can start ripping you off, hiking prices, stealing from you. She calls these events her "listening tours," that she does in both red and blue districts -- this one hosted by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Crowd Member: Every time I go to the supermarket, I get sticker shock. Groceries are so expensive now. What can be done to help people like me who are worried about grocery prices? Thank you. Lina Khan: The FTC is currently in court trying to block the largest grocery merger in U.S. history. Between Kroger – that owns Ralph's - and Albertsons, that owns Safeway. Together they have nearly 5,000 locations. Khan says this merger risks raising food prices even higher than they are now. Lesley Stahl: Grocery prices have gone through the roof. I believe that you think it's because of monopolies, but most economists say that it's because of supply chains caused by Covid and the Ukraine war. So which is it? Lina Khan: So there's no doubt that the pandemic and the war led prices to soar. What's been interesting is that even as some of those supply chain pressures have eased, prices have not come down concurrently as much. Lesley Stahl: So instead of inflation, are you contending that it's greedflation? That these monopolies are deliberately hiking the prices? Lina Khan: So there's a lot of discussion about what's driving the inflation and we've actually seen some executives boast on earnings calls about how inflation is great for their bottom line. Lesley Stahl: They say that? Lina Khan: They have said that publicly, yes. Lesley Stahl: What about the argument that when companies merge prices often come down, because of efficiencies, scale? Lina Khan: But even if those efficiencies arise, if the company's not checked by competition it won't have an incentive to pass those benefits on to the consumer because those consumers may not have anywhere else to go. Another consumer concern: the high cost of medicine. Pharmacist: As far as negotiating prices— Khan talks to independent pharmacists about the tricks and traps she says big pharma uses to jack up prices. For example, she zeroed in on the makers of asthma inhalers for extending their patents to keep low-cost generics off the shelves. Lesley Stahl: On these inhalers, they cost $7 in France. The same exact inhaler is around $500 in the United States. Wow. Now, something's out of whack. Lina Khan: We agree. So we took a close look at this and we found that companies were listing patents for things like the inhaler cap or the strap on your inhaler, so nothing to do with the actual ingredients of the drug or the formulation or composition of the drug. Lesley Stahl: So this is an inhaler for asthma. Show us what the innovation was that they claimed allowed them to extend the patent. Lina Khan: So it's this strap that they listed a patent for, this little piece of plastic. Lesley Stahl: No! They were saying that they should be able to continue the patent; generics can't come in for the medication, because they put that strap on-- Lina Khan: That's right-- Lesley Stahl: --to make sure you didn't lose the cap. Lina Khan: That's right. After the FTC sent warning letters to the four major inhaler makers, three of them – including this one - dropped the price from hundreds of dollars to just 35. And two days ago, the FTC filed a lawsuit to bring down the price of insulin and scores of other drugs, suing three companies the agency says are responsible for manipulating most of the prices. Lina Khan: These really fundamental things about people's daily material lives are affected by things like antitrust. But investment bankers, venture capitalists, and top CEOs say she's biased against them - that Lina Khan picks on winners because they're winners and thinks big is always bad. Lesley Stahl: Actually, Khan's doggedness represents a shift in policy, a mandate to reverse decades of a hands-off strategy toward mergers and acquisitions. It was introduced by Ronald Reagan and adopted by all presidents since, including Clinton and Obama, until President Biden put an end to it. President Biden (in 2021): We are now 40 years into the experiment of letting giant corporations accumulate more and more power, and where-- what have we gotten from it? Less growth, weakened investment, fewer small businesses. Under President Biden the FTC and the Justice Department have unleashed a crackdown, suing scores of companies, including Ticketmaster, Nvidia, and the big five: Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Apple, and a court just deemed Google an illegal monopoly. It's a revolution, and the face of it is Lina Khan. Male Student: We're all law students and we love you. Female Student: Can we have a selfie? Lina Khan: Sure! Male Student: Three, two, one. Thank you. When Khan was a student here at Yale Law School, she wrote a paper called "Amazon's Antitrust Paradox" contending that even though Amazon's prices are low, it's still a monopoly. Lesley Stahl: This was seen as an extraordinary breakthrough. And it went viral. Less than five years later, President Biden made her head of the agency that polices Amazon. Lesley Stahl: You know, Amazon is a very popular company. People like the convenience, the choice, the prices are pretty moderate. And they're afraid that you're gonna tamper with something that's good, that they like. Lina Khan: Our investigation uncovered that Amazon's illegal practices were actually raising prices for consumers because it had illegally muscled out rivals, locked them out of the market in ways that if you had more competition that Amazon hadn't squashed, consumers would be even better off. Amazon denies doing anything illegal and says if Khan wins, prices will go up. Also in the FTC's crosshairs: the issue of tech giants buying up smaller companies. Lina Khan: In the technology markets we went through a couple of decades where we saw over 800 acquisitions by the five big players, not a single one of which was blocked. And some of those we realize ended up leading to significant harm. Just to give you a concrete example, there were companies that were offering Americans greater privacy and they were promising that we're not gonna use your data, we're not gonna sell it, we're not gonna spy on you everywhere all the time. After some of those firms were bought up by one of the big guys, all of those data privacy policies changed overnight. And so Americans lost those privacy protections. Lesley Stahl: You're talking about Facebook and WhatsApp? Lina Khan: Yes, that's one example of that. She's now suing over Facebook's acquisitions of Whatsapp and Instagram. Lesley Stahl: Is the mandate to reverse what's gone on for 40 years, to undo some of the mergers that were approved. Lina Khan: We've identified not just one merger, but a whole string of mergers that some of these large companies made that we believe were illegal, that we believe were anti-competitive. Lesley Stahl: But they were approved. Lina Khan: They were not blocked, they were not challenged. But the courts don't always side with her. The FTC has lost a couple of big cases against Meta and Microsoft. Yet her cage-rattling has had a chilling effect where companies simply drop their merger plans. Lina Khan: Sometimes, you know, the companies decide that they're gonna abandon the merger. Lesley Stahl: If someone just says, "I'm not going to go forward," that's a win? Lina Khan: That's right. Lesley Stahl: Obviously the companies are complaining like hell, screaming. They don't like you. They're afraid of you. Lina Khan: Well, look, we're doing our job enforcing the law-- and— Lesley Stahl: They are they're afraid you're going to tie 'em up in court, you're going to cost them a lot of money and they're saying, "It's just not worth it." Lina Khan: So it's important to step back and keep all of this in context. Of all the thousands of deals that are proposed every year, the FTC and DOJ collectively investigate maybe 2% or 3%. That might not sound like a lot, but start-up founders complain that she's spooking investors so much, she's actually stifling innovation. Others fear that her chasing the tech giants will cause a domino effect. Earlier this month, after it was reported that her counterpart at the Justice Department subpoenaed the chip maker Nvidia the stock market plunged. Lesley Stahl: Do you ever worry about the power that the FTC and the chairman have that could result in a destabilizing of basically the whole economy? Lina Khan: Of course we have to worry. But we also should worry about the destabilizing effect that can arise from companies believing that they're above the law, and that they can be reckless, take massive risks in ways that can crash the economy, and then they can get away with just a slap on the wrist. And that creates a destabilization too. Khan can be seen as a belated reaction to the financial crisis when the government decided banks were "too big to fail." But has the pendulum swung too far? Corporations are pushing back with their own lawsuits to rein her in, setting up a possible showdown at the Supreme Court over the fate of the FTC. Lesley Stahl: Should you be concerned that you are flirting with diminishing the muscle-- the powers that you have if the Court decides you're wrong? And this Court could very likely say you're wrong. Lina Khan: I think one challenge that agencies can face is when they shrink their own powers and authorities by not actually using the authorities that Congress has given them. She's obviously unlikely to survive in her job if former President Trump wins, though she's admired by vice presidential nominee JD Vance – Sen. JD Vance: Well look, I don't agree with Lina Khan on every issue to be clear, but I think that she's been very smart about trying to go after some of these big tech companies. She's surprisingly popular with other MAGA Republicans. Lesley Stahl: There's even a nickname for conservatives who support you. What is it? Lina Khan: I'll let you– Lesley Stahl: Khan-servatives. Khan-servatives. On the flip side, it's unclear she would keep her job if Vice President Harris wins. Lesley Stahl: Some of her biggest donors are people who want her to get rid of you. They want you off the scene. And they're not just saying it privately. They're going on television. Lina Khan: Look, you know, my focus is not listening to what CEOs are saying on TV. You know, it's important in these jobs to really stay focused and block out a lot of the noise. Lesley Stahl: If you were asked to keep this job, would you say yes? Lina Khan: Obviously, those are conversations one has with one's family and that sort of thing. But— Lesley Stahl: You don't wanna have it with me? Lina Khan: But absolutely, I mean, there's so much work to be done, and it's such an honor to be in this role. And it would be an honor to have that opportunity to keep going.

Title: After The Fed Rate Cut: Soft Landing Checklist
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/09/22/after-the-fed-rate-cut-soft-landing-checklist/
Time Published: 2024-09-22T10:38:32Z

While the aggressive rate cut was a good start, whether it will prevent the economy from descending ... [+] into recession remain unknown. This article will identify some data to gauge the effectiveness of the Fed’s actions in supporting the economy. Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve delivered a larger-than-expected half percentage point (0.50%) decrease in short-term interest rates last week. While the rate cut was a virtual certainty, the path forward and whether it will prevent the economy from descending into recession remain unknown. This piece will identify some data to gauge the effectiveness of the Fed’s actions in supporting the economy. Because of the aggressive first move from the Fed, the odds of an economic soft landing should be considered higher than before the move. Though the real (after-inflation) Federal Funds rate remains above 2023, there are likely more rate cuts in the pipeline. After-Inflation Federal Funds Rate Futures pricing assumes another cut to short-term interest rates of at least 25 (0.25%) basis points at the November Fed meeting and a 50% chance of a 50 (0.50%) basis point rate cut. The December meeting has expectations identical to those for November. Number Of Rate Cuts Expected In seven of the last nine easing cycles, the economy was either in recession when the rate cuts began or ended in recession. Still, stocks usually rose in the twelve months after the cuts started. Stocks and the Magnificent 7 reacted positively to the outsized rate cut. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), underperformed the S&P 500 on the week but are now only 6.6% below their early July highs. The S&P 500 reached a new all-time high during the week, eclipsing the July 16 high. Stock Market Performance The U.S. economy remains resilient, with the Atlanta Fed’s estimate of third-quarter GDP at 2.9%. These estimates provide a real-time estimate of economic growth since quarterly GDP reports are provided with a significant lag. 3Q 2024 U.S. GDP Growth Estimate Other valuable high-frequency reports are the initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits. These claims have improved lately, but any significant softening in the labor market should be seen here first. Initial Jobless Claims The job market has softened. While the unemployment rate at 4.2% remains low on an absolute basis, it has risen off the lows enough to trigger the Sahm Rule, which has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession. There are several reasons to believe that the Sahm Rule might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Monitoring the prime-age, 25 to 54 years old, employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The rising prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence of some less dire outcomes in the labor market and the economy so far. The employment-to-population ratio is a monthly statistic updated in the monthly jobs report, and so is the unemployment rate. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio: 3 Month Average Separately, defensive stocks, less impacted by the economy, have often outperformed the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks during these easing cycles since they tend to correspond with periods of economic uncertainty or eventual contraction. Last week showed a better performance for economically sensitive stocks, bolstering the case that markets also viewed the Fed’s actions as supportive of better odds of avoiding recession. Cyclicals Versus Defensives Banks tend to underperform the S&P 500 before and often during recessions since their loan losses and profits are inexorably tied to the economy. Bank stocks significantly outperformed last week, adding to the optimistic view of the impacts of the more significant Fed rate cut on the economy. U.S. Banks Relative Performance Finally, the consumer is crucial for the health of the economy. Looking at the relative performance of the consumer discretionary sector can help indicate when the consumer and, by extension, the U.S. economy might be in trouble. The equal-weighted S&P 500 consumer discretionary index is used; otherwise, Amazon.com (AMZN) would dominate the analysis given its massive size in the capitalization-weighted index. Consistent with the other measures shown, consumer discretionary stocks outperformed. Consumer Discretionary Relative Strength Based on the indicators reviewed in this analysis and current economic data, the base case remains a soft landing. This COVID-related economic cycle is unlike any other, so our typically reliable yield curve and Sahm rule indicators should be viewed more skeptically than usual. The initial reaction to the larger-than-expected 50 basis point rate cut from the Fed has been positive across the soft landing checklist. It indicates that market participants are assigning higher odds of avoiding recession following Chair Powell’s aggressive start to easing monetary policy. If history is any indicator, success in avoiding a recession is no sure thing. Since markets reflect a higher likelihood of a soft landing, investors should expect price declines for stocks and other risk assets if recession probabilities increase. Since the eventual outcome remains unknown, investors should be mindful of their asset allocation and consider rebalancing after the robust stock gains. Owning high-quality and less economically sensitive stocks alongside technology and cyclical companies should benefit equity portfolios if the economy and earnings falter. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: Market Lessons: 20 Companies With Dazzling Growth In Revenue Per Share
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/baldwin/2024/09/21/market-lessons-20-companies-with-dazzling-growth-in-revenue-per-share/

Full Content:
Pornpimone Audkamkong/Getty Images W hat makes a growth stock? The first thing most investors look at is the earnings per share. But there’s a case to be made for giving equal attention to revenue growth. More precisely, you want companies whose revenue per share figure is growing at an impressive exponential rate. Winners on this score include such Wall Street favorites as Tesla, Block (the parent company of the Square payment network) and Meta Platforms (Facebook, that is). Ahead of them in the rankings are some less familiar names: Cheniere Energy, which exports liquified natural gas; Alnylam, a money-losing but very promising developer of RNA-based medicines, and MercadoLibre, a Latin American e-commerce platform whose shares see heavy trading on Nasdaq. Some smart investors have zeroed in on the top lines of companies. One was Charles Allmon (1921 – 2015), whose long-running Growth Stock Outlook newsletter included half a dozen stocks that appreciated more than 10,000% while on the recommended list. In an interview with Forbes on the occasion of his retirement at age 87, Allmon explained his philosophy. "In the long run a company cannot grow any faster than its sales," he said. "I look at sales first, earnings second and balance sheet third." Yes, earning growth matters a lot, and it’s scored in our review of earnings growers (see story list at bottom). But here we consider only revenue, not what companies get out of it. The sorting is by growth in revenue per share, since a boost in revenue made possible by a dilution of the share base doesn’t do much good for investors. Example: International Flavors & Fragrances, which makes chemicals for food and perfume aromas, looks pretty good in total revenue, better than tripling it over the past decade. But it has tripled its share count in that period. Its revenue per share growth comes in at an unimpressive 3% a year. Contrast that to Oracle Corporation, which sells software to maintain corporate databases. It is using its fount of profits to reduce the share count with buybacks. Thus, while Oracle’s total revenue has been growing at only a 3% rate, its revenue per share has been growing 10%. The analysis starts with 1,614 companies in the FactSet database that trade in the U.S., have market capitalizations over $1 billion and show revenue and shares outstanding numbers for at least 10 of the 12 years 2013-2024 (the last being a forecast). The long-term growth number is what comes out of an exponential fit to the revenue per share history. Predictability measures how closely that history tracks an exponential line (the statistician’s coefficient of determination), with a penalty for missing years. The top 10% of the group in predictability get the “Very High” label, the next 15% “High,” the next 15% “Above Average.” Among big companies with “Above Average” or better predictability, here are 20 standouts, with revenue per share growth between 22% and 58%: Not quite squeaking in are two names you expect to see: Amazon.com and Alphabet (i.e., Google). They both make the second ranking, however. This roster is limited to big companies with growth rates above 18% and Very High predictability: The final list is an assortment of revenue disappointments. It includes a woebegone utility (the former Pacific Gas & Electric), a good company in a shrinking industry (Artisan Partners, active management), a telephone company that wasn’t sure about diversifying into content (AT&T) and two greater-fool speculations (GameStop and AMC Entertainment). The revenue and share count statistics used as inputs come from FactSet, the price/earnings ratios from YCharts. Conclusions about growth rates are the author’s. The calculation uses a share count estimate for December 2024 that is an extrapolation of the recent trend in shares outstanding.

Nvidia Corp 's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Colette Kress, has made significant transactions in the company's stock, according to a recent filing. Kress sold a total of 59,670 shares with a value exceeding $7.7 million. The transactions occurred on September 20, 2024, under a pre-arranged trading plan. The sales were executed at weighted average prices ranging from $116.19 to $118.05. Specifically, Kress sold 45,510 shares at an average price of $116.19, with individual sales prices between $115.67 and $116.67. Another batch of 14,291 shares was sold at an average of $117.15, with prices ranging from $116.68 to $117.65. The final set of 6,869 shares was sold at an average price of $118.05, within a range of $117.68 to $118.52. These transactions follow a previous disposition of shares by Kress on September 18, where 68,609 shares were withheld by Nvidia to satisfy tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock units, valued at a price of $115.59 per share, totaling approximately $7.9 million. Following these transactions, Kress's direct holdings in Nvidia have been updated to 4,954,214 shares. Additionally, there are indirect holdings through a limited liability company connected to an irrevocable trust, totaling 767,680 shares, and smaller amounts held indirectly by immediate family members. Investors often monitor insider transactions for insights into executive sentiment on the company's prospects.
