June 03, 2025 17:07 ET | Source: Robbins LLP Robbins LLP SAN DIEGO, June 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins LLP reminds stockholders that a class action was filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV) common stock between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025. DoubleVerify operates a software platform for digital media measurement and advertising optimization services. For more information, submit a form, email attorney Aaron Dumas, Jr., or give us a call at (800) 350-6003. The Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (DV) Misled Investors Regarding its Business Prospects According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants failed to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; and (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025.

Title: Coinbase delayed revealing data breach that may cost up to $400M, drops third-party vendor

Legal battles loom for Coinbase over delayed breach disclosure and insider hacks. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Secret knowledge, sudden split: the crypto exchange faces mounting legal and regulatory heat for a four-month silence over a breach affecting at least 69,000 customers. Coinbase was alerted as early as January 2025 that hackers had siphoned tens of thousands of customer records from one of its overseas support vendors, but the exchange waited until 14 May to notify regulators and users, according to internal emails reviewed by Reuters and interviews with three people briefed on the incident. The revelation comes as Coinbase abruptly terminated its relationship with TaskUs, the Texas-based outsourcing firm whose India call centre staff were allegedly bribed to leak screenshots and KYC files. At least 69,461 customers’ names, addresses, partial Social Security numbers, and ticket histories were exposed. Coinbase has warned investors that the breach could cost $180 million to $400 million in remediation and potential claims. Coinbase said it discovered evidence of contractor misconduct, moved quickly to cut access, and is enhancing controls across all third-party vendors. TaskUs confirmed it fired more than 200 employees in Indore after Coinbase raised alarms in January, but it insisted it “immediately escalated” the issue to its client. A TaskUs spokesperson said the company is “cooperating with law enforcement agencies in India and the United States.” Under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s new cyber-incident rule, publicly traded companies must file an 8-K within four business days of determining an incident is material. Coinbase’s May filing noted “prior months” of unauthorised activity but did not specify the January alert. Such inaction could be considered to be a textbook case of material non-compliance. The SEC may ask for confirmation as to why the clock didn’t start in January. A securities-fraud class action filed Monday in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania alleges Coinbase “withheld adverse information” that would have moved its share price. A separate negligence suit targets TaskUs in Manhattan federal court on behalf of affected users. Court filings describe a small criminal ring that paid support agents to photograph Coinbase’s screens with personal identifiers visible. By March, the scheme had widened, with stolen credentials sold on Telegram channels tied to “pig-butchering” crypto scams. On 11 May, the hackers, emboldened by their haul, emailed Coinbase demanding $20 million in exchange for deleting the data. Coinbase refused, instead offering a $20 million bounty for information leading to arrests. TaskUs, founded in 2008 and now valued at around $1.5 billion, counts Meta and DoorDash among its clients. Crypto exchanges like Coinbase have leaned on the firm to provide 24/7 customer support at a lower cost than U.S. hires through its 61,400 full-time staff. Security consultants warn that offshoring sensitive identity documents to low-wage environments creates the perfect storm for insider bribery. Human-layer attacks are increasingly outpacing technical exploits, as buying an underpaid agent is far cheaper than breaking robust encryption. The breach occurs as Coinbase and other crypto stakeholders wage a public campaign for lighter U.S. crypto rules. Rival exchanges Kraken and Gemini, who also use business-process outsourcing shops, will now rush to audit their own vendor controls, according to people familiar with those reviews. Meanwhile, affected Coinbase customers report continued phishing attempts and SIM-swap attacks. The company has offered two years of identity-theft monitoring but has not committed to reimbursing any downstream crypto losses. For Coinbase, the incident threatens balance-sheet costs and its narrative as the most compliant brand in crypto. Trust is the only hard currency an exchange has. Losing it, even for four months, can be fatal. Also known as "Akiba," Liam Wright is a reporter, podcast producer, and Editor-in-Chief at CryptoSlate.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Steelmakers Rise, Automakers Fall as Trump Pushes Steel Tariff Hike

Major U.S. equity indices edged higher as June trading kicked off. The modest gains came despite reheating trade tensions between the world's largest economies as Chinese trade officials rejected President Donald Trump's claims that the Asian nation had violated a trade agreement announced last month. After wavering for much of Monday's session, the S&P 500 rallied in the afternoon to close with a gain of 0.4%. The Nasdaq was up 0.7%, while the Dow eked out an uptick of 0.1%. Shares of several U.S. steelmakers surged after President Trump announced a plan that would double steel tariffs to 50%. The president said the higher duties on steel imports would protect U.S. workers in the industry and encourage more companies to source the material from U.S. steelmakers. Steel Dynamics (STLD) shares soared 10.3%, marking Monday's top performance in the S&P 500, while Nucor (NUE) shares surged 10.1%. Gold futures prices jumped more than 2% on Monday, boosted by heightening geopolitical tensions and a weakening U.S. dollar. The uptick in the price of the precious metal helped lift gold-related stocks, including shares of Newmont (NEM), the world's largest gold producer, which added 5.4% on Monday. According to a Wall Street Journal report, Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms (META) intends to launch a service by the end of next year that will allow advertisers to create and target campaigns entirely through artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Meta shares gained 3.6%. Renewable energy stocks remained under pressure following last week's announcement that the Department of Energy would terminate more than $3.7 billion in grants for clean energy and climate-related projects. The funding cuts exacerbated concerns about the proposed elimination of some renewable energy incentives under the House's reconciliation bill. First Solar (FSLR) stock tumbled 5.3%, declining the most of any S&P 500 stock on Monday. Shares of defense technology specialist Leidos Holdings (LDOS) dropped 4.6%. Last week, Leidos announced that it had acquired Kudu Dynamics, a firm known for developing offensive cyber capabilities enabled by artificial intelligence (AI), in line with a new company strategy that pegs cyber as a key growth area. However, Baird analysts downgraded Leidos stock last week to "neutral" from "outperform," citing a challenging booking environment and an uncertain outlook for government contracting. Shares of U.S. automakers lost ground following Trump's comments on steel tariffs. Higher import taxes threaten to raise vehicle manufacturing costs. Both General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor (F) saw their share prices drop 3.9%, while shares of Chrysler and Jeep parent Stellantis (STLA) lost 3.6%.

Title: Meta Shareholders Vote To Shut Down Bitcoin Treasury Proposal in Near-Unanimous Decision

Shareholders at Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta have decided to shoot down a proposed Bitcoin (BTC) treasury for the tech giant. According to an 8-K Filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from last week, the vast majority of Meta shareholders voted against a BTC treasury proposal as a hedge against inflation. “On May 28, 2025, Meta Platforms, Inc. (the “Company”) held its annual meeting of shareholders via live audio webcast… At the Annual Meeting, the Company’s shareholders voted on fourteen proposals, each of which is described in more detail in the Company’s definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 17, 2025… At the beginning of the Annual Meeting, there were 1,769,720,699 shares of Class A common stock and 342,865,499 shares of Class B common stock present or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting, which represented 92.61% of the combined voting power of the shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting (voting together as a single class), and which constituted a quorum for the transaction of business.” According to the filing, 3.9 million shares voted for the proposed treasury, while 4.9 billion shares voted it down. Since founder Mark Zuckerberg controls approximately 60% of the shares, it can be reasonably assumed that Zuckerberg voted against the measure. Despite the BTC Treasury vote, Meta is still reportedly eyeing a venture into stablecoins amid growing interest and demand for digital assets.

(“Meta” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: META). Such investors are advised to contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980, ext. 7980. The investigation concerns whether Meta and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. [Click here for information about joining the class action] On May 15, 2025, the Wall Street Journal published an article entitled “Meta Is Delaying the Rollout of Its Flagship AI Model.” Citing “people familiar with the matter”, the article reported, in relevant part, that “[c]ompany engineers are struggling to significantly improve the capabilities of its “Behemoth” large-language model, leading to staff questions about whether the improvements over prior versions are significant enough to justify public release[.]” The article further reported that while originally “Behemoth was internally slated for an April release”, Meta subsequently “pushed an internal target for . . . Behemoth’s release to June” before “delay[ing] . . . to fall or later.” On this news, Meta’s stock price fell $19.02 per share, or 2.88%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $640.34 per share on May 16, 2025. Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

June 02, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, June 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming July 21, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) common stock between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR DOUBLEVERIFY INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On May 7, 2024, DoubleVerify released its first quarter 2024 financial results and reduced its 2024 revenue guidance, disclosing that there had been a pullback in customer spending on advertising. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $11.79, or 38.6%, to close at $18.78 per share on May 8, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on February 27, 2025, DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending. The Company also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was having a negative impact on the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $7.83, or 36%, to close at $13.90 per share on February 28, 2025. Then, on March 28, 2025, Adalytics Research, LLC published a report alleging, among other things, that DoubleVerify’s web advertisement verification and fraud protection services were ineffective and that its customers were regularly billed for ad impressions served to bots. The same day, The Wall Street Journal reported that DoubleVerify regularly missed detection of nonhuman traffic despite the Company’s claims that it helps brands avoid serving ads to nonhuman bot accounts. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (2) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (3) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (4) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (5) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (6) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (7) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired DoubleVerify securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than July 21, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Meta (META-2.36%) believes that the source of 97% of its revenue can be fully automated by AI: its ads. By the end of 2026, Mark Zuckerberg’s company will employ AI to work with brands to create their own advertising — imagery, video and text — and then target them to specific users on Meta platforms, according to The Wall Street Journal. The ads could even be made specific to geolocation and time, reflecting local scenery or weather conditions in the imagery. Along with potentially making design departments obsolete, it could disrupt video production as well. Major advertising companies such as Omnicom Group saw their stock prices drop following the news. On an earnings call for Meta’s Q1 2025 report in April, Zuckerberg said, “AI has already made us better at targeting and finding the audiences that will be interested in [businesses’] products. I think that this is really redefining what advertising is — into an AI agent that delivers measurable business results at scale.” Meta’s first-quarter revenue was up 16% year-over-year, to $42.31 billion. Ad impressions were up 5%; the average ad price increased 10% year-over-year. Use of AI tools in creating ads increased by 30% that quarter. “If we deliver on this vision, then over the coming years, I think that the increased productivity from AI will make advertising a meaningfully larger share of global GDP than it is today,” Zuckerberg said then. The company is putting its money where Zuckerberg’s mouth is, investing $65 billion in AI infrastructure in 2025. Last month, Zuckerberg was touting the idea of AI friends and chatbot therapists as a solution to the loneliness epidemic.

Welcome back! The start of another week could mean a scramble to figure out what you're eating every night. A registered dietitian suggests these 15 items at Costco that can be healthy, quick dinners and satisfying snacks. In today's big story, the best bet for job seekers might be returning to a familiar place. What's on deck Markets: The top hangout spots for Wall Street's incoming interns. (You decide whether you want to visit or avoid them.) Tech: New data shows how quickly chatbots are scooping up human jobs. Business: Some franchisees for Floyd Mayweather's fitness business are taking legal action against the legendary boxer and the company. But first, what's old is new again. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The future of the job market might be about looking in the past. Job seekers and their former companies are finding comfort in reconnecting as both sides navigate a challenging job market, writes BI's Madison Hoff. ADP payroll data for March indicated that the share of boomerang hires increased since the same time last year. It's no surprise that workers and their old bosses are teaming back up. The economic uncertainty has everyone on edge, and dealing in known quantities offers some relief. For job seekers, returning to a previous employer could mean stability and security that you might not typically find at a new job. Meanwhile, employers are being cautious about making new hires. They want to be certain about the ones they do bring on. A former worker whose capabilities are already known could ease those concerns. Not everyone will be welcomed back to their old stomping grounds. When workers held all the power in 2021, some made rash decisions as they headed for the exits, which could come back to bite them. They "rage quit," or used a red-hot job market to create bidding wars for themselves. The ones who stuck around sometimes took it easy, avoiding the #hustleharder culture for a new trend: quiet quitting. Even if you think you're in good standing with your old bosses, you might be wrong. BI previously reported how tech companies like Meta and Microsoft have "block" lists of ex-employees they won't rehire. Things could also be a lot different than what you remember. At one point, companies were happy to hand out flashy titles and quick promotions to keep workers happy. Efficiency and frugality are now all the rage, and the status an ex-employee once held might not remain. Like an eldest child returning from college only to find their younger sibling has taken over their room, the times have changed. 1. Oasis Management founder's jet-setting month. Seth Fischer spoke at three different Sohn conferences across the globe in May. He's passionate about the Sohn Foundation, which focuses on childhood cancer research and prevention, and is named after his former colleague, who died from the disease at age 29. 2. Wall Street's "uber-bear" warns about potential stock declines. Albert Edwards, who shot to fame for predicting the dot-com bust in the late 1990s, told BI that stocks are still vulnerable. In his opinion, the top risk the market should be wary of is rising Japanese interest rates. 3. Where Wall Street's summer interns hang out. Hundreds of college students will soon descend upon New York City as they start their summer programs on Wall Street. Industry insiders spoke with BI about the top spots interns frequent when they're not pulling all-nighters. 1. AI is already taking human jobs. Companies are hiring fewer people in roles that AI can do, according to data from Revelio Labs. Not all jobs are disappearing at the same rate — those with more AI-doable tasks are vanishing faster, which is bad news for people in tech. 2. Southeast Asia's tech startups are chasing the American dream. Traditionally, startups from the region focused on local markets, but AI is piquing their interest in building for the US. Plus, having American customers is good for fundraising. 3. How the robots get made. Amazon is spending big on robots and automation for its fulfillment centers. BI got an inside look at how the robots are made and trained in facilities outside Boston. It's a glimpse into the new US manufacturing. 1. A legendary boxer's fitness business is struggling, and everyone is pointing fingers. At its peak in 2023, Floyd Mayweather's Mayweather Boxing and Fitness had 70 locations. Dozens have closed. The boxer's attorney pointed to wider industry challenges, like a slowdown among boutique gyms. Some franchisees say Mayweather could have done more to support the business. 2. Bride or die. Bachelorette parties aren't just about ibuprofen and bikinis. Nowadays, women book dayslong vacations that include merch and decor to prove their love to the bride. These trips are often just as anticipated — and can even be as expensive — as the big day, bolstering a whole new subset of the economy. 3. Don't blame DOGE. Elon Musk said DOGE was treated unfairly by its critics, and became the "whipping boy for everything," in an interview with CBS that aired on Sunday. Though he's leaving his role as a government employee, Musk said he'll continue to work on DOGE, albeit on a part-time basis. Campbell's reports earnings.

Title: ‘Freedom Cities’ and Our Tech Overlords’ Visions for the Future
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/06/freedom-cities-and-our-tech-overlords-visions-for-the-future.html
Time Published: 2025-06-02T10:00:38Z
Full Content:
Hierarchical tech weasels made a splash in early May with their vision for Guantanamo Bay. The Charter Cities Institute (CCI), a front group for billionaire Silicon Valley interests, wants to turn the home of US torture chambers into a high-tech charter city, which will double as a “proving ground” for migrants seeking to enter the US. Those lucky enough to make it to the imperial heartland might find themselves in Guantanamos anyways. That’s because so-called “freedom cities” might be coming to the 50 states as well. What Are the “Freedom” Cities? Elon Musk recently got his company town in Starbase, Texas, which could be viewed as a first step toward a US where these billionaires create laws in their own jurisdictions that fit their personal needs. To bring about Starbase, in December 2024, more than 70 county residents (believed to be SpaceX employees) petitioned for an election to make Starbase its own municipality. In May it passed overwhelmingly. Starbase can now raise funds through taxes, acquire property through eminent domain—which it is already doing— and create its own zoning rules. It has its own mayor and two commissioners—all SpaceX employees. “Because this is a project that is closely affiliated with SpaceX, you can imagine that the goals for the municipality are probably in pretty close alignment with the needs of SpaceX,” Alan Bojorquez, an attorney who specializes in city governance, told Texas Tribune. Indeed, one of the biggest benefits for SpaceX of the incorporation may be the ability to avoid environmental red tape. In July 2024, conservation groups filed a lawsuit against the Federal Aviation Administration, alleging that it rushed SpaceX’s Starship permitting process without adequate environmental review or mitigation requirements. SpaceX is also facing fines of almost $150,000 from the Environmental Protection Agency for allegedly illegally dumping pollutants into a Texas waterway without a permit. Starbase will almost certainly pass its own more permissive rules, and the Texas government is already voting to give Starbase more authority over the closure of a popular beach on weekdays for launches. Along with Starbase, other tech giants are planning their own build outs in cities where they already run the show, dominating real estate and local government. Google is planning a massive neighbourhood around its headquarters in Mountain View, California, Meta is doing the same thing with “Zucktown” in Menlo Park, and Musk wants a Tesla town, too. Many write-ups on Starbase and the freedom cities compare them to the company towns of old where one business owned and controlled everything, surveilled the population, paid workers in“scrip”, and led to startling rates of suicide and addiction among citizens. That very well may be the future for some— if not most — of these freedom cities, but there’s another darker layer to this current push, which makes these new-age company towns more problematic. While some of the freedom cities may be partially or wholly devoted to quasi-slave labor and human lab rat tests there also exists the possibility of population engineering to them, as well as to the rest of the country they would be leaving behind. From Urban Geography: Freedom Cities are thus, not merely land development schemes; Freedom Cities are where deserving elements of the population are promised perks and subsidies that favor family formation and will build out the favored community as a replay of a mythologized past… As a political maneuver, the Freedom Cities plan’s core purpose is precisely to conjure new cities in a distinctly fascist mold and generate a shared desire across the Trumpian movement not just to carry out a clean break with present-day cities but to turn their backs on the latter. In the imagined new city of his movement, prosperity and safety abound, while elements that have been cast as undesirable, abject, and anti-American are forcibly kept out through intensive policing and state protection. The Charter Cities Institute (CCI) and others are lobbying the Trump administration for more than just the creation of company towns theoretically under the jurisdiction of the state. They essentially want their own statelets within the US. The argument is that exemption from some federal laws replaced by oversight by a tech baron would drive innovation and prosperity. Here’s more from The New Republic: More controversially, CCI proposes to do something very akin to what the Emiratis are best known for doing—erecting a labor economy that more readily resembles modern-day slavery. The big selling point for its GITMO haven suggests that the hypothetical city could house migrants who wish to move to the U.S., keeping them under surveillance for a “probationary period” while “evaluating their contributions to the local economy and society.” “High performers become prime candidates for U.S. residence, while those who disrupt public order can be repatriated quickly—no labyrinthine state courts involved,” the authors write. Frontier Foundation, a 501c4 organization, as well as the Housing Center at the American Enterprise Institute and the Foundation for American Innovation, are also on board. In April, the groups issued a joint letter to the Trump administration that begins: We, the undersigned founders, investors, builders, and scholars write to express our strong support for Homesteading 2.0, consisting of the Home Sweet Home and Freedom Cities initiatives designed to add 3 million new homes and drive American economic and technological dynamism. It goes on to argue that the Bureau of Land Management should sell of 600 square miles of land for Freedom Cities. The Frontier Foundation has its eye specifically on BLM outside cities like Boise, Idaho; Grand Junction, Colorado; and Redmond, Oregon. The details of how the cities will actually function and who will own and run them are sketchy but appear similar to Starbase with perhaps even more “freedom.” Here is more from the letter (caution: high levels of dynamism incoming): The newly established urban districts, with streamlined governance and targeted regulatory relief, hold tremendous promise for accelerating American innovation, strengthening our industrial base, and addressing the most pressing economic and technological challenges facing the United States. Paired with new urban development, Freedom Cities can offer a dynamic regulatory framework for re-shoring critical industries, expanding housing affordability, and facilitating rapid progress in emerging fields such as biotechnology, aeronautics, and energy. By removing red tape, Freedom Cities can create jobs, improve global competitiveness, and push the technological frontier. Much of their argument includes the promise that these freedom zones will have affordable housing. And in case it wasn’t clear from the letter, the Frontier Foundation’s policy memo also includes the following: Regulatory Opt-Out Mechanisms: Grant the Secretary-level heads of agencies, such as the Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Transportation Secretary (DOT), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) rules, discretion to waive or expedite certain regulations within Freedom Cities. Streamlined Environmental and Building Approval: Mandate expedited National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) reviews and simplified building codes, ensuring that infrastructure, housing, and industrial projects can break ground within months rather than years. Who Is Behind the Freedom City Push? Much of the money flowing into the likes of the Frontier Foundation, CCI and the Foundation for American Innovation are shrouded in secrecy due to their status as 501c3 non-profit organizations that have been granted tax-exempt status by the IRS. But the Foundation for American Innovation, as an example, identifies numerous billionaire laundering services as “major supporters” including the Miles Foundation, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, the Diana Davis Spencer Foundation, the Walton Family Foundation, the Sarah Scaife Foundation, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Beth and Ravenel Curry Foundation, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, and the Searle Freedom Trust. Two major players behind the movement, which is being driven by the likes of Marc Andreesen and Peter Thiel who back the venture capital firm Pronomos Capital, which has funded a charter city in Roatán, Honduras and several city projects in Africa, including one in Nigeria called Itana. [1] Trey Goff, the chief of staff of Próspera, tells WIRED that he and other Próspera representatives working under an advocacy group called the Freedom Cities Coalition have been meeting with the Trump administration, which is unsurprisingly receptive. During his 2024 campaign Trump came out in full support of the freedom cities: Reportedly the administration is so enthusiastic that the plan has grown in scope from creating ten such cities to as many “as the market can handle.” Why Do Tech Overlords Want Them? The official line is a collection of all the usual BS out of Silicon Valley. We can look to the rantings of Marc Andreesen for evidence. Andreessen, the billionaire who co-founded the venture capital firm a16z and, before that, played a role in the invention of the modern web browser. He is also one of the major backers of the freedom cities, as well as a major player in the Trump administration and a driving force behind the Signal groups that began during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, and which fueled the new alliance of tech and the US right. Andreessen is considered some sort of wise sage by the hierarchical tech crowd. Take the word of Minicircle cofounder Mac Davis who is also working with the Frontier Foundation. Minicircle is a longevity biotech company focused on developing gene therapies to extend human lifespans. It’s backed by Thiel and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and it currently has offices in both Austin, Texas, and Próspera. According to WIRED, Davis says that Minicircle’s gene therapy clinical trial on the protein follistatin—which he claims increases muscle mass without side effects, and also has life-extending benefits in mice—was only possible in Próspera, but noted he’d like to see that change. And it will, he believes, when freedom cities bring “American Dynamism” a reference to writings from Andreesen screeds, which argue that tech companies under the leadership of their wise billionaire leaders will save us from our failing government institutions and the pratfalls of democracy. Let’s take a brief look. Here’s Andreesen’s “The Techno-Optimist Manifesto” going beat poet on us with his societal visions: There are only three sources of growth: population growth, natural resource utilization, and technology. Developed societies are depopulating all over the world, across cultures – the total human population may already be shrinking. Natural resource utilization has sharp limits, both real and political. And so the only perpetual source of growth is technology… Productivity growth, powered by technology, is the main driver of economic growth, wage growth, and the creation of new industries and new jobs, as people and capital are continuously freed to do more important, valuable things than in the past… We believe this is why our descendents will live in the stars. We believe that there is no material problem – whether created by nature or by technology – that cannot be solved with more technology… We have a problem of poverty, so we invent technology to create abundance. Give us a real world problem, and we can invent technology that will solve it. We believe free markets are the most effective way to organize a technological economy. …Profits are the incentive for producing supply that fulfills demand…. We believe any deceleration of AI will cost lives. Deaths that were preventable by the AI that was prevented from existing is a form of murder… We believe there is no inherent conflict between the techno-capital machine and the natural environment… We believe we should place intelligence and energy in a positive feedback loop, and drive them both to infinity. We believe we should use the feedback loop of intelligence and energy to make everything we want and need abundant. We believe the measure of abundance is falling prices. Every time a price falls, the universe of people who buy it get a raise in buying power, which is the same as a raise in income. If a lot of goods and services drop in price, the result is an upward explosion of buying power, real income, and quality of life. Note Andreesen’s emphasis on abundance, which Democrats are now embracing to slash the red tape and let the vultures feast in an effort to get back in the good graces of money men like Andreesen. And notably, Jeffrey Mason, the head of policy at the Charter Cities Institute, tells WIRED the freedom cities lobbying groups are also having conversations with Democratic members of Congress. So this reimagining of the US as a federation of billionaire-run emirates will have staying power beyond Trump. But back to Andreesen and the ideology he represents. His whole spiel is that anyone or anything standing in their way is preventing the creation of this utopia: A world in which human wages crash from AI — logically, necessarily — is a world in which productivity growth goes through the roof, and prices for goods and services crash to near zero. Consumer cornucopia. Everything you need and want for pennies. — Marc Andreessen 🇺🇸 (@pmarca) January 25, 2025 It is of course all complete nonsense. What Andreesen and his like are after is more money and power of which company towns or freedom cities are a major part. Here’s Brian Merchant summing up their true motivations at Blood in the Machine: These notions—AI can replace workers, the government should function like a startup—are not meant to describe reality; they are meant to create a permission structure for those in power to obtain more of it. Here, AI will either allow Trump and Musk to install more loyalists, hollow out the administrative state, or degrade the quality of services once provided; all outcomes that favor Trumpism, and, I guess, Muskism. The startup mentality, meanwhile, seeks to give license to break laws, in the name of progress, of disruption, of building the future. Same as it ever was: Way back in the early days of the Industrial Revolution, early factory owners deployed automation to deskill workers, to justify employing precarious and child laborers, and as a means of circumventing long-held laws—all to produce more products at lower quality, and to concentrate profits, and power, in fewer hands. That helps explain why despite Andreesen’s promises that earthly paradise is nigh, he and his fellow weasels spend so much time and money worrying about building a police state. Andreeseen is focused on his primary home of Las Vegas while other tech billionaires have their own pet projects. That makes sense if you subscribe to the teachings of monarchist pundit Curtis Yarvin who was reportedly lionized in the Andreessen-led Signal chats. Here’s Quinn Slobodian on Yarvin’s vision for the future—much of which is playing out in real time: Right-wing accelerationists imagine existing sovereignty shattering into what Yarvin, writing under the pen name Mencius Moldbug, calls a “patchwork” of private entities, ideally governed by what one might call technomonarchies. Existing autocratic polities like Dubai serve as rough prototypes for how nations could be dismantled into “a global spiderweb of tens, even hundreds, of thousands of sovereign and independent mini-countries, each governed by its own joint-stock corporation without regard to the residents’ opinions.” These would be decentralized archipelagoes: fortified nodes in a circuitry still linked by finance, trade, and communication. Think of the year 1000 in Middle Europe but with vertical take-off and landing taxis and Starlink internet. Yarvin expressed the essence of the worldview recently when he enthused over Trump’s proposal to ethnically cleanse the Gaza Strip and rebuild it as a US-backed colony securitized as an asset and sold to investors—as he called it, “the first charter city backed by US legitimacy: Gaza, Inc. Stock symbol: GAZA.” One wonders what type of Gaza they have in mind for their American freedom cities. This? Or this: Or perhaps the first is a freedom city and the latter is one of the left-behind zones? How Soon Could We Find Out? Here are the options under consideration to breathe life into stateside freedom cities according to WIRED: According to Goff, Freedom Cities Coalition has briefed White House officials on three options for creating freedom cities. One is through “interstate compacts.” In this scenario, two or more states could set aside territories with shared tax and regulation policies, with some state-specific carve-outs. Under existing law, these compacts can’t be revoked, though they can be dissolved under certain circumstances. If an interstate compact is approved by Congress, it becomes valid under federal law. Goff says the coalition is considering Congressional legislation that would give “advanced consent” to any freedom city compacts. That way, Congress wouldn’t need to approve each individual city. Two other options are creating federal enclaves with special economic and jurisdictional zones, or having Trump issue executive orders to create each new freedom city. The freedom city lobbying groups are urging that sites would ideally be announced by July 4, 2026. So mark your calendar! One concern with such cities is that they would hollow out the rest of country since they would be free from regulation from the likes of Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. (A bunch of nuclear reactors in freedom zones powering AI data centers free of any oversight from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission—what could go wrong?) That “freedom” from oversight would draw investment and jobs away from the rest of the country choking on its last morsels of democracy. But perhaps DOGE and other Trump administration destruction of the state are an attempt to do the hollowing out before the building of the “freedom” cities. By starving all but the Pentagon and and Homeland Security of funds and intentionally blowing up the ability of the state to function, the administration helps make the case for freedom cities. Naomi Klein and Astra Taylor argue in The Guardian that we are in the midst of “end times fascism”, which they claim is even worse than the mid-20th century version. While that might be a bit hyperbolic, perhaps we’ll get there at this rate. Regardless there’s no doubt that the Silicon Valley illuminati have designs to take us to—or leave us behind in— a dystopia of their making, and they have a government ready to accommodate them: Inspired by a warped reading of the political philosopher Albert Hirschman, figures including Goff, Thiel and the investor and writer Balaji Srinivasan have been championing what they call “exit” – the principle that those with means have the right to walk away from the obligations of citizenship, especially taxes and burdensome regulation. Retooling and rebranding the old ambitions and privileges of empires, they dream of splintering governments and carving up the world into hyper-capitalist, democracy-free havens under the sole control of the supremely wealthy, protected by private mercenaries, serviced by AI robots and financed by cryptocurrencies. Personally, I’d be inclined to let ‘em have at it—if those living in their little fiefdoms are there of their own volition, the creation of their statelets didn’t involve the destruction of ours, and their actions weren’t destroying our shared earthly habitat. It doesn’t appear any of those three conditions will be met, however, which leaves me with just one question: What’s the progress report on Musk’s dream of colonizing Mars? That sounds like an ideal solution for all—except the red planet. Musk, Andreesen, Thiel, and friends could bring all their AI, crypto, and court jesters there and be completely free there to pursue their utopia. Notes 1. The Honduran Congress passed a law in 2022 repealing the allowance of SEZs. Próspera then sued the Honduran government. The lawsuit is ongoing and, as of now, Prospera remains operational. Another example of a “Freedom City” is Disney World, where Florida cut a deal to give the corporation exclusive rights to develop the land as they saw fit, and a carve out from any state or local law enforcement. When Disney went “woke”, the governor tried to rescind some of the legislation but I don’t think it was eliminated. Disney also did this with an experimental city they built called “Celebration”, which actually exists. And people flock to see the Mouse by the millions. Been a while since I’ve seen the Matrix (while Keanu Reeves is a stand up human being from what I can tell, he is a terrible actor! – can’t stomach his movies), but if I recall correctly, a generation ago the movie wondered whether given the choice, people would prefer physical reality or a computer generated fantasy world, all watched over by machines of loving grace. A quarter century later, with people moving about staring into their phones immersed in tiktok videos and AI-generated crapola, I think we have our answer. The problem with the current iteration of Freedom Cities is that the machines watching over us are neither loving nor graceful. to paraphrase great art critic Robert Hughes re. cities/urbanity and the 5000-year, quixotic quest for the perfect city: “it seems that much like plants, we need the $h…it of others to survive…” from his “Shock of the New” book/tv series re. urban planning….a TV series I sorely hope that AI will be able to clean/upscale to 4K in the near future even bill gates-backed city is in the desert. hey, I hate winter too…but the Arizona desert in July? (when there are practically infinite large tracts of “Sim City”-like land near the Great Plains interstates or just look at all the vacant lots of detroit/buffalo…Tech bros really hate snow, lol Catherine Austin Fitts on the Danny Jones show. Musk and the creation of the control grid. utube, 8+ minutes. Trump’s “Control Grid”: 3 Steps He’s Using to Enslave Americans | Catherine Fitts https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJqayjnlBjk Or perhaps the first is a freedom city and the latter is one of the left-behind zones? It goes deeper. Andresson’s “sources of growth” leaves out another possibility. Growth by stealing resources from other people. The “left-behind” zones are not left out or apart from the supertech system. They are the fundamental resource being extracted to pay for the high tech cities. The misery is the point. No matter how hard those in deprived zones work, no matter how much value they create, their surplus value will simply be siphoned off to pay for the lifestyle of others. The only limiting factor to this system is the additional resources which must be allocated to pay for the oppression and subjugation of such territories or social classes. As the inequality deepens, only massive investments in oppression technology will be able to make the project scale. But simultaneously the availability of technology enables more effective dissent and resistance among oppressed populations. The likes of Andresson will see a lot of money to be made in this dynamic. Sucked out from the downwardly mobile middle class mostly. Just a reminder that the Solano County based “California Forever” project wasn’t gone away and the most recent pivots include proposing a ship building project and annexation by two cash strapped local cities to get around county regulation. A slow grind by investors with deep pockets and a huge land bank. https://californiaforever.com/ https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/28/california-forever-tech-boats https://www.thereporter.com/2025/05/12/suisun-city-gives-california-forever-update/ Not sure the opposition is up to the task https://www.solanotogether.org/about “Personally, I’d be inclined to let ‘em have at it—if those living in their little fiefdoms are there of their own volition, the creation of their statelets didn’t involve the destruction of ours, and their actions weren’t destroying our shared earthly habitat.” Remember: it’s a heist. And they are like the ultimate culture vultures. Not creators. Any competition has to be destroyed to keep people in those dystopias…not out. If those freedoms are responsible for their own security and enforcement of laws, go for it. When they are subject to assault by other entities I w8sh them well. Unless there is no alternative (TINA), they can’t sustain their dystopia. Bet there is a part 2 that hasn’t been revealed for their “freedom cities” that shows plans for “Greater Freedom Cities”. “When they are subject to assault by other entities I w8sh them well.” The global spread of something like neo-liberal economic ideology should be looked at as the “hegemony”. Bringing it back down to earth: rich influencers flock together like birds of a feather. Is there a material difference between freedom cities and abundance cities? From my perspective there isn’t any. no. two sides of the same 5,000 year-old technocrats’ dream: (healthy) cities are chaotic, choked w/ traffic, inefficient, full of micro-triggers; but I, Raymond Cocteau, can solve all the problems and bring more joy if only everything was made per my diktats Personally I welcome the incoming oligarchic paradigm these cities represent if only because it’s so delightfully cyberpunk. I dream of pacing down a rainy dystopia-city street, smacking myself beside the head to mute the google adsense brainchip feeding me information about cosmetic products on my way to my 17 hour shift in the anthro-ambulatory energy center (definitely not a series of giant hamster wheels for humans). Top 10% generators each month get an extra box of reduced-plastic content nutripellets! One person’s cautionary tale is another person’s operations manual. This whole thing is coming off like a real-life version of OCP in the original Robocop movie. Unfortunately, a lot of Robocop’s predictions are coming true, right down to the idiotic ads in everything. It’s time to dust off Snowcrash, Bioshock, and all the other fiction which addressed the ludicrous contradictions of isolationism and power in planned capitalist enclaves. Heck, take a trip to Tuscany, where the great towers of the great families were seized and torn down by competing fiefdoms. Any broligarch archipelago willing to bro Galt against civilization as a concept via “networked” freedom cities —a broligarchipelago?— will discover in short order there shall be no network, instead thousands of cities laying violent siege to one another. Meet the new medieval, same as the old medieval. Additionally, there are other 80s sci-fi threads weaving through society. Watched Running Man lately? (Appropriately based on a story from Stephen King – which puts this mess squarely in the HORROR sci-fi genre where it belongs). Looks like gated communities are not enough and now they want to go for gated cities. And those sea-based communities have never gotten started. I can make a few predictions though based on past performance. Any of these cities will demand billions of dollars from the Federal government for infrastructure but will also demand that the Federal government have no say in how their cities are run. Each city will have a poverty-stricken town nearby from where workers will be bused in daily to perform the menial work that needs to be done in that city. Going in the opposite direction will be garbage and waste materiel to that town for “processing”. Each city will tap any underground water and proceed to suck it dry as it leads to less water to farmlands near that city. Each city will demand goods, services from the State government or else they will move that city away. Unsurprisingly, State governments will believe them. The inhabitants will be monitored and surveilled to a massive degree and they may even have to tolerate a camera up the wazoo. All the collected data will then be monetized and sold on. Finally, these cities will on the whole be not really safe for women who will have no recourse through the private police. Those sort of boats will not be allowed to be rocked. Not in a libertarian tech-bro culture it won’t. Also, seat belts and motor-cycle helmets will be illegal. This will only work when the menial tasks are automated, so robotic cleaners and gardeners. But who grows stuff and who repairs and installs stuff? The elite tend not to have practical skills beyond one narrow discipline. These cities aren’t arcologies, and are completely dependent on the outside for resources just like Masada. The Gulf States seem to have no problem with this proto-neofeudalism. In all Gulf States subcontinent Indians = big minority; in a couple,a majority of the population. all fine when there is plenty of money….when times are lean (and those workers can’tor won’tgo home)? Perhaps the denizens of the nearby poverty towns will have the mordant humor to rename them ” Poortowns”. And then start referring to the Freedom Cities as “Freedom Johannesburgs” and the Poortowns as ” Freedom Sowetos”. And then figure out how to move disease germs into the Freedom Johannesburgs. Perhaps the Freedom Soweto Resistance will figure out how to create time-delay binary poisons. And then figure out how to dose every Freedom Citizen of the Freedom Cities with one of the two binary poison ingredients, cumulative, non-removable from the body. But entirely innocuous until the second ingredient is added to find the first ingredient in every Freedom Body and combine with it to produce the lethal poison with lethal effect . . . when the Zero Hour Time comes. Fordlandia; https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fordl%C3%A2ndia Wonderful piece. A reminder that the internet made a bunch of incel gamers billionaires. This is all just End Times rationing and hoarding. It’s ironic that they can’t see that just like Gaza (and Mars), their land is available because it doesn’t have reliable water or decent conditions for raising crops or livestock. They will never be self-sufficient. They’re think that they can turn their backs on us, but we can and will turn the tables on them. “Careful what you say. The assassin drones have ears.” You have to assume the Freedom Cities will try every highest techest method to detect or anticipate, and then exterminate, every such attempt at turning the tables. The would-be table turners will have to work out ways to survive all of that in order to live long enough to get those tables turned. “Freedom Cities” or any of the charter city startups have yet to demonstrate successful implementation of even a small housing development. I’m not sure if Starbase qualifies. It’s a small number of employees living at the launch site. It’s hardly a “Freedom City” or “Charter City” as envisioned by the libertarian utopians. For a more dramatic description of what might come, one could read Margaret Attwood’s MaddAdam trilogy. Didn’t think it was possible I could loathe Yarvin more than I already did but then I read his opinions about Gaza and had to step away from the computer for several minutes to bring my blood pressure down. This post and Conor’s book review post today reminds me strongly of a book I read a couple of years ago about the Southwest Desert here in the US, The Water Knife. A science fiction book about a potential near future… with lots of science backing it up. Nice little Freedom City you got here. Be a shame if a semi full of attack drones had to pull over somewhere nearby, amiright? This threw me for a loop. Apparently, for some Americans, the idea of freedom is to seek permission from the relevant governmental authorities to start a municipality, so as to create by-laws, rules and regulations, and so as to start taxing the residents. As opposed to finding an unincorporated area, keeping it unincorporated so there are no rules, bylaws and regulations, no local taxes, and you can do whatever you please. Anybody remember Jack London’s The Iron Heel? The Iron Heel, novel by Jack London, published in 1908, describing the fall of the United States to the cruel fascist dictatorship of the Iron Heel, a group of monopoly capitalists. Fearing the popularity of socialism, the plutocrats of the Iron Heel conspire to eliminate democracy and, with their secret police and military, terrorize the citizenry. They instigate a German attack on Hawaii on … BTW, there are two remaining Defendants being sued for price fixing by the Forever California crowd. And so the 2nd and 3rd generation looks around at the “less free” cities and towns and says “bull pippy” and starts a revolution in these freedom cities. Oh, but that’s right, the tech monarchists always knows best and will “correct” the revolutionaries. 40 years ago there was Rajneeshpuram in Oregon: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajneeshpuram what goes around comes around. Thanks for this excellent article Conor. I’ll add a couple of details. Pronomos Capital which you mention as a leader in the emergence of “freedom cities” is the baby of Neo-Reactionary poster boy Patri Friedman. Formerly, Friedman ran the (Thiel-funded) Sea-Stedding Institute. Thiel and Friedman were the two main writers in the legendary/infamous 2009 Cato Unbound issue which one could argue marks the beginning of 1. nRx thought 2. Post-democratic libertarianism. Friedman’s article Thiel’s article If one can wade through the sophomoric logic, both articles are illuminating regarding the current libertarian onslaught. Also I see other posters referencing Snow Crash and I’ll point out that it gets cited regularly in Thielverse circles and apparently changed (Thiel sidekick/LinkedIn founder) Reid Hoffman’s life Finally I’ll repeat the recommendation to read Max Chavkin’s biography of Thiel “The Contrarian” which covers a lot of this ground. It has just occurred to me that this movement among the tech overlords is just another version of a deep but rather thin American impulse to an ideal communal existence. The Mormons are an outgrowth of such impulse. The Shakers and hippie communes ultimately failed. New Age spiritual communes basically failed although there are remnants. There are countless cults ongoing at any one time. Attempts at ashrams on the Indian model come and go. Most involve charismatic leaders, big donors and a desire to escape from whatever by the followers. This just seems the cyberpunk version. The same old problem still exists….how do all these brilliant, high IQ, hyperindividual lights get along? Same as it everywhere was. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Fear Martin Marietta At $550?

Time Published: 2025-06-02T09:00:00Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. UKRAINE - 2021/05/24: In this photo illustration, Martin Marietta logo is seen displayed on a ... More smartphone and pc screen. (Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Martin Marietta Materials Inc (NYSE: MLM) stock fell 27% from its all-time high of approximately $620 in November 2024, decreasing to $453 in April 2025. It then rebounded by about 22% to current levels around $550. Thus, the stock is down roughly 11% since November, despite the company reporting an operating margin exceeding 42% in 2024. In comparison, Meta reported operating margins of 42% in 2024 and has still seen an increase of 9% from early November to now! However, there’s an important point to consider: Martin Marietta trades at 32 times earnings. Reversing that gives a meager 3% earnings yield. For reference, Meta—which owns Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Reality Labs—trades at a significantly lower earnings multiple of 23 times and is growing revenue almost twice as quickly. Meta's revenue has grown by 13% over the last three years, while MLM experienced revenue growth of 6.7% during the same period. So yes, Martin Marietta benefits from consistent infrastructure demand which ensures stable cash flows and strong returns. But at $550 per share, this represents a premium valuation pursuing a growth narrative that simply isn't keeping up. And what happens when the growth fails to meet expectations? That’s when reality sets in. See Buy or Sell MLM stock? MLM is frequently regarded as a long-term asset that will gain from sustained urbanization, infrastructure enhancements, and population growth, but history paints a different picture. During the 2008 global financial crisis, its shares plummeted nearly 64%. At the beginning of the Covid pandemic in 2020, they dropped by 49%. Moreover, in 2022, amidst rising inflation and consumer pressure, Martin Marietta faced another setback with a 33% decrease. Not exactly resilient—yet currently, the stock trades at a premium valuation. MLM benefits from stable demand propelled by infrastructure expenditures, particularly owing to government initiatives like the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). Projects involving highways, bridges, and public works necessitate substantial volumes of aggregates — MLM's core product. Furthermore, MLM stands as one of the largest providers of construction aggregates in the U.S., which affords it pricing power and economies of scale. Its size and vertical integration enhance operational efficiency. MLM consistently showcases strong earnings, significant free cash flow, and high returns on invested capital. Yet the broader context is less exciting. As of the first quarter of 2025, Martin Marietta has encountered a notable rise in its debt levels, mainly due to strategic acquisitions and capital investments aimed at expanding its operations. Debt was reported at $5.41 billion as of March 31, 2025, marking a significant increase from $3.95 billion at the conclusion of 2024. The company disclosed a debt to EBITDA of 4.06 for the quarter ending March 2025, which surpasses the industry median. The company reported solid performance for the first quarter of 2025. Revenues totaled $1.35 billion, reflecting an 8% year-over-year increase. In FY26, the company has projected revenues between $6.83 billion and $7.23 billion, indicating a growth of 5 to 10%. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to increase by around 9%. That’s hardly significant growth for a company valued like a hyper-growth tech stock. Adding to the difficulties are weather-related risks. Operations can be disrupted by hurricanes, storms, or other extreme weather events, which have historically caused production delays and impacted revenue. Despite valuation pressures and macroeconomic risks, MLM's scale provides it with considerable advantages. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on the IIJA, which allocates $1.2 trillion for infrastructure projects over five years. As of early 2025, roughly 66% of highway and bridge funding is yet to be utilized, suggesting a substantial pipeline of projects extending through 2026 and beyond. In Q1 2025, Martin Marietta reported a 6.8% increase in the average selling price of aggregates to $23.77 per ton, driven by organic price/cost improvements and margin-accretive acquisitions. This pricing momentum is likely to persist, bolstering revenue growth. Investing in a single stock carries inherent risks. Conversely, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has demonstrated a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past 4 years. Why is that? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index, exhibiting less volatility as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

June 01, 2025 14:25 ET | Source: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP SAN DIEGO, June 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that purchasers or acquirers of DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV) common stock between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), have until July 21, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. Captioned Electrical Workers Pension Fund, Local 103, I.B.E.W. v. DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc., No. 25-cv-04332 (S.D.N.Y.), the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit charges DoubleVerify as well as certain of DoubleVerify’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-doubleverify-holdings-inc-class-action-lawsuit-dv.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. CASE ALLEGATIONS: DoubleVerify provides media effectiveness platforms. The DoubleVerify class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where DoubleVerify’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (ii) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (iii) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (iv) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted DoubleVerify’s profits; (v) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; and (vi) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities. The DoubleVerify class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 28, 2024, DoubleVerify issued lower revenue growth expectations for the first quarter of 2024 due to “a slow start by brand advertisers and a slow ramp by recently signed” customers. On this news, the price of DoubleVerify stock fell more than 21%, according to the complaint. Then, on May 7, 2024, as the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit alleges, DoubleVerify cut its full-year 2024 revenue outlook due to customers that were pulling back on their ad spending. On this news, the price of DoubleVerify stock fell nearly 39%, according to the complaint. The DoubleVerify class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 27, 2025, DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending, and defendants further disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting DoubleVerify. On this news, the price of DoubleVerify stock fell more than 36%, according to the complaint. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired DoubleVerify common stock during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit.
